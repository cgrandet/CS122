The place was empty when I arrived, I ordered a cheese burger with my beef. When I observed the young lady casually tossing ten fries in the deep frier, I asked if that was my order. I informed her the fries looked a little light. She replied you get a small order with the burger. I asked her how could she ensure it was a small order since she arbitrarily pick up some fries and tossed them in the basket. She refused to add more. From that point forward, the older lady working with her watched me with reckless abandonment. I don't know why, they were working behind a locked door and plexiglass. When I arrived at the house, I was very disappointed. The corned beef was very lean, but dry and lacking flavor. Usually the container is greasy from cooking process that gives the meat its unmistakable legendary flavor. I have purchased fatty meat, been given less than a pound of meat, but never given flavorless dry meat. The reason customers continue to patronize this place,regardless of the extremely exorbitant prices, is the unique flavor of the meat.

First off, yes Pizza Hut is not great food, but I don't order it because it's great. \u00a0I order it because I need a quick, inexpensive pizza. \u00a0It is perfect if that is what you are looking for. \u00a0This location has been consistently bad. \u00a0I've ordered from them a dozen times over the past 2 years I'd say, and every time, there is something wrong with my order. \u00a0Items are missing, the food is cold, or, frankly, it arrives looking like it got dropped several times. My experience on 10/31/14 takes the cake though. \u00a0For starters, I expected that on Halloween night, pizza delivery would take a while, but I was prepared to wait. \u00a0I ordered a pizza through the Pizza Hut website at about 6:50 p.m., got a delivery time of 9:50 p.m.. \u00a0No big deal, really. \u00a0The pizza arrived a little before 9:50 p.m., but when I got it back to my apartment, I discovered that I had been sent the wrong pizza. \u00a0So, naturally, I called the store.I was on hold for 20 minutes before anyone picked up the phone. \u00a0When they finally did, the line was so staticky that I could not hear the person, and that person hung up on me. \u00a0I called back and spent another 15 minutes on hold. \u00a0The first person I talked to had no idea how to help me, so she got the manager. \u00a0The manager (whose name I didn't catch) was extremely nice, offered to send the correct pizza back out immediately, but said it would still probably be an hour, just because of how back up they were. \u00a0I said that was fine. \u00a0This was at about 10 p.m..12:40 a.m. rolled around and still no pizza. \u00a0The store was closed at this point, but I did receive a call from the manager again that my order had gone out, but the delivery driver had been pulled over by the police and would not be delivering my pizza. \u00a0She said to call back the next day (today, November 1) and my correct order would be sent out, no charge. \u00a0So I called back today, and was again put on hold for 20 minutes before anyone picked up. \u00a0I talked to three different people, but finally got my correct order placed. \u00a0I was then put back on hold, where I will assume I was forgotten about because when someone finally picked up, they gave their opening \"Thanks for choosing Pizza Hut\" spiel. \u00a0I told them who I was, and they said my order was put in. \u00a0For pick up.I corrected the person, that no I was told it would be delivered, and she informed me that their delivery was so backed up that they weren't accepting delivery orders. \u00a0This is unacceptable on a number of levels, and it sucks that they expect me to go to the trouble of driving to the store to pick up food that they were supposed to deliver. \u00a0I finally talked to another manager who said it would be delivered, but the wait again was 2-3 hours.Bottom line: always expect to wait 20 minutes on hold if you call them, and 2-3 hours for your food to be delivered, no matter what time of day you order. \u00a0This location is clearly understaffed, and as a result, under performs. \u00a0I appreciate all the efforts of the manager to rectify the situation, but there are better places for cheap, fast pizza, and I will not be ordering from this location in the future.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 11, 1]}, "21": {"description": "I never expect amazing things from Pizza Hut, but I've always preferred them over Dominos.

I went to this salon to get a touch up on my Senegalese twist. I normally go to someone else, but considering I waited to the last minute, my shop was booked, so I decided to patronize this business because it's nearly walking distance from my home.My appointment was scheduled for 9am, and I arrived at 9am. When I arrived there was already one other woman being serviced, so I was asked to wait in the chair. I waited, and waited until another woman came strolling in at about 9:20am. We started at approximately 9:30, and my hair only took a little over 2 hours to complete. Not bad, right? That's what I thought too, until I looked at my hair in the mirror and noticed that my twist were significantly shorter than the twist that I originally had in my hair. When getting a touch up, you only take down the perimeter of your hair to be re-twisted, giving you a new and fresh look despite the twist that were not done over in the middle. I literally took down two rows of twist in the front, one row of twist in the back, and one row along the sides of my head. To be honest, I should have only paid maybe, $50, but when I asked Fatou what the price would be she told me $80. Now, granted we had already had a conversation about price the day prior and although I thought $80 was a bit expensive for a touch up, I still came to the shop because I had no where else to go. The problem didn't come in until I politely asked Fatou why is it $80 when my twist are not even the same length as my original twist. She immediately became aggressive and visibly upset. Keeping my composure, I asked her to calm down because it really wasn't necessary for her to be as angry as she was. I asked a simple question, and as a customer I have the right to do so, especially if my hair is not done how it should be. Fatou continued to display aggressive behavior, yelling \u00a0and carrying on. I explained to her that I have full intention of paying the amount quoted, however, I don't think it's fair considering she did not do my hair how it should have been, and it only took her a little over 2 hours. The price she quoted me is equivalent to almost half the price they charge for a full-head of Senegalese twist, which can take anywhere from 6-12 hours depending on the braider' speed, size, and length. The amount of hair that needed to be touched up in my head was not even close to half, it was barely 1/3, not to mention I took the hair down myself prior to coming to the shop, and they were not as long as my original twist. For these reasons there was no way my hair was worth $80, and because I decided to speak on that( very politely might I add), Fatou became extremely enraged. Besides the fact that Fatou was yelling at me, and very aggressive, once she received the $80 from me, she yelled at me saying not to come back and kicked me out of her shop. I've honestly never seen anything like this, especially towards someone that was nothing but nice during my entire visit.

This was kinda annoying because i got there around 3 and i only have 5 braids in my head by 5..But when they were done eating, three people started working on my hair and finished it in about 3.5-4 hours, which was great because I thought it would take 5-6 hours. I was out of the shop by 9.My only complaint is that they do overbook. Fatou(the owner) scheduled about five or six clients for 9 AM the next day, and only four women worked there.

I orderd the 1/4 chicken dark, a large mac n cheese, the cabbage and green beans.When I got home, I broke out the food and it was deeelicious! The mac n cheese was definitely very good, the jerk was also very good and tender, and the cabbage and string beans were well cooked. I was a fan!However, I've gone back 2 times since then and MY GOODNESS! The salt content in the food was out of control!! The first time, I thought it was a fluke..maybe an off day. The second time, I realized my first experience must have been the fluke. It seems like over salting is the norm. The last time I ordered from there, I literally rinsed off every piece of chicken, piece by piece, and then had them soak in water. Still too salty even after that. Ended up throwing most away.I had to do the same with my vegetables (soaked, re-soaked, and soaked again) - and then heated back up in microwave. Still over salty.And then the biggest disappointed ever - the mac and cheese! Texture was still great.. flavor would liokely have been great too if it weren't for the fact that it, too, was soooooooo salty! I ended up rinsing (gross, I know) my mac n cheese, as well, in hopes that I could save it. Nope :( \u00a0Ate around it some, but ultimately threw it out as well because much too salty.My siste r- who loves salt and has a much higher tolerance than me - even said it was way too salty. Her words: \"man! If I think it's too salty, you know that's a problem.\"So hopefully, they figure out what's going on with the salt before all their customers die from strokes.But since i don't want to be one of them, I'm going to stay away for now.ah well...", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 10, 10]}, "0": {"description": "People are definitely sleep on this place.

An Italian by birth, he came to Chicago in the 1980's and is not only an accomplished player but a font of knowledge. The bartenders are amazing as well.

There's no doubt these guys are the real deal. If high energy West Side Blues is your thing then Lil' Ed will fill your cup. And what is perhaps even more impressive than his playing (which I expected to be good) is the fact that during intermissions he's walking around the club, signing CD's, having a smoke outside with the patrons, cracking jokes, posing for pictures and just generally being an ambassador of his band, his music and this club.

This is a wonderful place to learn about the incredible variety of Indian cooking. We went on a Saturday morning and had such a wonderful time. Ranjana is patient and incredibly knowledgeable. I have been eating Indian food my entire life since I grew up with Indian friends--but I had no understanding of the taste elements of Indian cooking present in every dish...It was really helpful to learn how ingredients interact with each other--and also--for considering how you might pair dishes together for a larger dinner party to showcase your new Indian cooking knowledge. This class is the kind of gem you feel really lucky to find in a city that has become increasingly corporate in its food business. We have fewer independent coffee shops, bakeries and delis every year. This place should be celebrated--along with the communal kitchens that are popping up--enabling smaller food purveyors to showcase their craft.

I contacted Ranjana about signing up for the Northern Indian cooking class one Saturday. She was already booked but emailed me the next day saying that she could accommodate us later that same Saturday as there were other people that wanted the same class. Perfect! Our class consisted of my husband and I plus one other couple. Ranjana started the class by demonstrating how to make Masala Chai and went over some of the different Indian spices, how to use them, and which ones to add before cooking or after cooking. It was very informative and a topic that I didn't know much about. In all, we made several chutneys, samosas, daal, roti, paneer, an okra dish, an eggplant dish, plus dessert. Each person contributed to the cooking and some dishes (roti and samosas) were demonstrated by Ranjana and then each person was able to make their own. What I liked best about the class was Ranjana's flexibility. She asked what our favorite Indian dishes were and gave us general instructions on how they are prepared. She also gave us many suggestions on ways to modify different dishes either for dietary reasons or lack of time. I felt the class was really more about understanding Indian cooking techniques and ingredients rather than just sticking to a recipe. Ranjana had us taste as we were cooking to see if the food had enough salt, spice, etc... which is invaluable if you are going to be cooking on your own and want everything to be balanced. After completing the class, I was confident that I could cook Indian food at home. In fact, the next week after the class my husband and I made Masala Chai, chutney, and roti at home. I can't wait until we attempt samosas! If you have any interest in Indian cooking at all, Ranjana's classes are an excellent way to learn this cuisine.

We made some of the recipes at home, and while they did not taste exactly the same as in class, they were delicious and blew away the rest of our family. I do not like bananas, but Ranjana put them in the Chutney. When she heard I did not like bananas, she told me she could have used pears. But I loved the chutney anyway and made it with bananas at home. So Ranjana opened up a whole world to me. My son was totally satisfied with eating a vegetarian meal, when it was so full of variety and taste and better than our favorite indian restaurant.in New York.

She's cheerful and sweet, and has a motherly quality which makes you feel right at home. \u00a0Based in Hyde Park, she gives cooking classes out of her kitchen, which is equipped with with an industrial stove. The classes accommodate 8 people, so the environment is intimate. \u00a0You can choose to attend classes one at a time (on Saturdays from 9 a.m.-1 p.m.) or in a 4 class series. This past Saturday we made 9 different dishes from Northern India including Matar Paneer, Pakori, Coriander Chutney, Pulav, Paratha, Chole, Aloo Gobi, Kheer and Chai Tea. Being a newbie to Indian food, Ranjana did a great job of taking us through all the spices and how they are used, where to shop for the items, and how to prepare each of the dishes. Everyone got a bit of hands-on cooking time, but mostly we sat, watched, took notes and learned, which was just my speed. One thing I find when we eat at the different restaurants on Devon is the food can be really oily. Ranjana showed us how much oil the restaurants tend to use, and it was great to see because it just reaffirmed it's probably kinder on the waistline to make Indian food yourself! The best part of the class was the end where we all shared the meal around her dining room table. It was fun meeting new people and \u00a0learning a new way to cook.

I was not too happy to fork over that extra dollar but I prefer chicken fried rice.Order was supposed to be delivered in an hour and it arrived in about and hour and 10 minutes, which wasn't horrible but was annoying. Food arrived and there was a lot of food. Like a lot of food. Enough for days. The rice was okay but there were way too many mushrooms and it was missing something. The rangoons were mediocre - more breading than anything. There were was very little crab/cream cheese mixture. The gyoza were great. The orange chicken tastes like orange chicken.Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant.

JR had to come back to our site, but I was out of the office so they didn't realize that I had never received my food. No worries...we call and speak with the owner and his daughter to explain. They apologize (they knew they messed it up), but said their driver was out for the day and did not know when they would return. Once again, no worries....they promised to deliver my order AND provide a refund for the purchase. I appreciate customer service so, no harm no foul. Our office contact even promises to make additional orders so that we can maintain our relationship.Monday rolls around, and no sign of JR. Office contact calls and is told that they are unable to deliver today due to a health inspector visit (troubling, but hey....I guess it happens)...but they will DEFINITELY make the trip tomorrow with my order that was missed, and with the extra items we planned to order.Now it's Tuesday. I get the message that JR is coming to deliver about 11:30am. I clear my schedule to make SURE I'm here.

They never have anything ready and you would \u00a0think with only having about six items, they would keep the shelves filled, but that is never the case.

Bijou answered and we discussed what I wanted to get done including the size, length and cost of the Senegalese twists. She said she could start at 930 or 10am the next day - on Sunday! I had a tight schedule and really wanted to get them done, but I told her I needed to be done by 2pm so that seemed unrealistic. She agreed. But she then said she would arrive a little early at 9am for me and have two braiders work on my head so long as no other walk-ins or appointments showed up. Bet.On Sunday, I arrived on time and she was already there waiting for me. We discussed again what I wanted now that we were in person and could review pictures. I started to feel like maybe larger sized Senegalese twists are soooo difficult for folks to agree to style, but thankfully she installed one sample twist on my head that I liked and we got started at 9:30am. Bijou and Francis worked extremely quickly. Other than the fact that my head was being tugged in different directions, the installation was relatively painless (unlike that crazy lady on Saturday who thought I would let her rip all my hair out with her tight handedness!! Excuse the rant.) Part way through, two gentlemen, one was Bijou's son, started to twist on my head too. I was like ummmm, what's happening?? Four folks were working on my head at the same time. I didn't verbally say anything but I guess my expression was enough because Francis chimed in to explain that once the two ladies had started the twists halfway down, the two guys would follow up and complete them... Senegalese twists are super long after all. Cool. Never had four folks work on my head at the same time. What did it feel like? Beautiful chaos! I kid you not, my hair was completely twisted by 12pm! That's just 2.5 hours after they had started! The last hour from 12-1pm was just Francis trimming the excess hairs down each twists, securing the ends in hot water and spraying my scalp and hair. I was absolutely amazed at the quality of work they did and the speed. Obviously this expedited time frame is not normal if you only have 1 person on your head, but boy did I appreciate their focus on getting me in and out of the salon on time!

They did a couple of samples before starting to ensure I would be satisfied. \u00a0They do have a couple of rules like, no children unless they are being serviced (she still allowed my kids), paying upfront (after showing the samples and ensuring you are happy of course) and getting back to them within 24 hours to address any issues with the completed product, plus a few others (good business practices, in my opinion). She gave me a few business cards offering $10 off of any service and I get $10 off if my name is mentioned on my next visit.

After a massive 3-week long search, I came across a listing for Bijou online in yahoo business pages. I decided to step out on faith and give them a try. I called a week in advance to make my appt and spoke with Bijou. I told her what I wanted and she stated the price for micros starts at $160 and goes up depending on how full, or long you want them, etc. So, on my appt day, I arrive on time, Bijou is there ready and waiting. She assessed my hair--which is fairly short, and advised that for me, the cost would be $200. I thought the price was fair. She let me take a look at the hair, asked if I was interested in certain colors...I chose black and we got started. The place was very clean. Bijou was very nice, attentive to me as her customer, made sure I didn't get a ticket if I parked by the meters, and listened when I expressed concern with how I wanted my hair to look. She was very patient with me as well, as I have a very sensitive scalp and she tried her best to be gentle. We got started about 9:20am and right at 3pm, I was walking out of there. I am used to micros being done in 3hrs where I come from, but I must say, it was a breeze and it did not seem like I was there for 6 hours. Oh, and my hair is ridiculous!! I mean that in a good way...it is so neat and very very tiny! I absolutely love my hair and I have gotten so many compliments on it. My husband loves it too so that's a plus. Also, the hair used is very good hair, it is very shiny, soft, and does not tangle; very easy to manage. Before I left, Bijou gave me some \u00a0business cards and offered me a 10$ discount for referrals.

What a difference a year makes. In my February 13, 2014 review I wrote: \"Six of us went to dinner at the Parrot Cage for a GREAT night out. ... An adequate wine list that was reasonably priced. Culinary students run this place? Really? Bon Appetite!\" What an ABOUT FACE for my experience on February 13, 2015. My experience last night warrants an overall grade B+ (down from the A+ I issued in 2011): Our Waiter Alex gets an A+++; the Hostess a D; the Manager a C+; and the Chef a B. Allow me to explain why the adults in the front of the house hurt the students' grade, and why our experience was somewhat disappointing.First and foremost, our 2014 experience lead to exceedingly high expectations for 2015. They recently remodeled and I was concerned they might not open in time for our dinner. Despite speaking to the hostess/manager/staff three times in the six weeks prior to this dining experience, including on the day of our dinner, not once did they bother to mention the major development of no longer having a valid liquor license--it's BYOB now. Literally 10 minutes before my 5 guest arrived I had to drive to 71st & Jeffery - in the hood - to purchase three bottles of the most average wine imaginable. I probably should not have been surprised when the hostess had an attitude with me because I politely expressed my displeasure with not having been told of this development. Her \"bad behavior\" was consistent with my previous experience there. In a review of Parrot Cage that I wrote on June 5, 2011, I stated: \"A relatively rude manager/hostess, and a pedestrian wine list, did not overshadow the otherwise outstanding front-of-the house service from these culinary students, and an exceptional very diverse menu with exceedingly well-prepared food by the back of the house.\" With regard to the food, my comments are generally the same as in my 2011 and 2014 reviews, although I had to send my steak back. I ordered medium rare, they delivered well-done. The second version was medium-well, but as everyone else had eaten, I ate the center of the steak and we moved on to the decadent dessert course. Our waiter Alex, and the other servers were the BEST aspect of the evening, other than the exceptional company of my guests.The most disappointing aspect of the evening was how much the ambience of this establishment has changed since it was remodeled last month. By removing the carpet (now tiled floors), drapes (no window treatments at all), and wallpaper (it was due to be changed), and adding bright lighting, they not only eviscerated the quaint and almost romantic aspect of the room, but the place is now loud. That does not excuse the rude old man who conned his way into a free meal, from interrupting our dinner to tell us to \"quiet down.\" Next year he won't have to worry about our group--we'll be at La Petite Folie where we started to go this year! Let me close by saying that if you chose to dine there, and I plan to, it's best for couples only. Large groups will resonate too loudly. By the way, did I mention that I'd give Alex an A+++", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 2, 14]}, "14": {"description": "Not a huge reviewer, but had to comment on this place.

The views (when it's not pouring rain, like last night) are wonderful and the overall atmosphere is just great.With that said, the Parrot Cage received 4 stars from me. The food was excellent (I had the Pan Seared Tilapia), our server was nice and attentive and even apologetic when my Aunt's fish was a little too spicy for her tastes and couldn't be redone for her. She even went the extra mile to not charge my Aunt for the drink that she had. \u00a0My biggest complaint however, is that it took what felt like 5 years for us to get our food after we ordered.

Along with the blues, its forefather, it is one of the first truly indigenous music's to develop in America. I have been excited to experience the Jazz club scene since I have moved here from south Florida but I couldn't find anyone that was truly interested in going and checking out the scene until one of my friends was in town for a business trip and he just so happened to be a little obsessed with it himself and was actually in a Jazz band when he was younger. So it was game on from that point and just needed to find the right place! \u00a0I saw that Andy's had great reviews so we decided to check it out. It was a Thursday night and we arrived at around 6:30 and they told us the entree fee would be $15 a person. My friend gave him his credit card but the guy said that they only accept cash for the entree fee. So we had to dig around for cash or go across the street to the ATM. \u00a0They also told us that there was a 2 hour limit but did say that if they were not packed then we could stay longer. I thought the fact that they only take cash for the entree and that there was a 2 hour limit was quit odd but was still staying very optimistic to try this out. Since we were the first to arrive we had our choice of where we wanted to sit so we choose right up front in the middle of the action for the dinner and show. My friend ordered the Moscow mule to and was served in the traditional copper mug (I had a few sips and have to say it was one of the best I've had) I ordered my usual Dirty Martini but had to send it back to be fixed because it wasn't dirty enough but they hit it right on the nose the 2nd try. We decided to skip the appetizer and go straight for the entr\u00e9e. We both were thinking about the Cajun Shrimp Risotto but we decided to order one and then the Mustard Crested Halibut for a little variety. By this time the band was setting up and our entr\u00e9e's came out right when the music was starting. It was perfect timing!! The Cajun Shrimp was so so but the Halibut was absolutely amazing! \u00a0We sat there and allowed the drinks to flow as we enjoyed the company of an old friend and the energy of Chicago earthy grooves of soulful jazz. We were tapping our feet to the speedy, hard hitting rhythms of be-bop jittery, atonal forays of free jazz. I felt like I was in heaven. We stayed long past the 2 hours and they never said a word.

The atmosphere inside is delightfully old-fashioned, with gussied-up patrons, stylized line drawings and a wall full of framed photographs. It's also VERY crowded, understandably, as they want to squeeze in as many paying customers as possible -- I was just grateful we were seated by an aisle, as I'm a little claustrophobic!I ordered a moscow mule to start, which was served in the traditional copper mug and had a nice kick to it (hey, wonder if that's how it got the name?) and my husband had a draft beer. Later, we split the Cajun jambalaya, which was fabulous -- fluffy rice topped with a vegetable-studded spicy sauce and beautifully fanned-out slices of crispy duck breast. It was very fairly priced at $24; it probably would have only served one hungry diner, but we had already enjoyed appetizers and cocktails somewhere else.But for once, the food has to be secondary in my review, because the real reason we were there was the music. I used to go to jazz clubs all the time in college and absolutely loved them, and as soon as the music started I wondered why in the world I had stopped going at all. It was incredible. The group wasn't well-known (at least to me) but they were amazingly talented, a combination of American and European musicians who worked together to create musical alchemy. It was such a thrill to hear their solos, feel the electricity in the air and see how hard they were working (major sweat happens when you play with energy!) Reading some of the other reviews, most of the negative comments seem to center around their fees and policies, but in our experience they were much stricter on paper than in person. We ordered one drink each and split one entree, but no one raised an eyebrow. We stayed longer than our allotted two hours, and again, not a word or nasty look from anyone. The only person who was censured by the management while we were there, truly deserved it; he had had way too much to drink and kept trying to sit down at tables while they were being cleared, but the clever FOH manager was having none of that. We actually appreciated her taking charge of the situation, as it distracted from our experience. And finally, the cover charge? Totally worth it. $15 each for two hours of top-quality live music is something of a bargain in a big city.
