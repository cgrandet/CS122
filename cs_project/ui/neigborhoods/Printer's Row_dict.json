I admit I wasn't very specific but I did say I wanted my hair shorter but still long enough in the back and I wanted to keep it angled. He said \"I got it\" very confidently so I trusted he knew what I wanted. But then his first cut took maybe over 5 inches off the back right side so there wasn't much I could do then to stop him. After he was done cutting I made sure the sides were even which they weren't and had him cut more on the left. He explained this was a different cut where he cut on an angel not straight like a bob. I was still worried when it was all done that it was not even and was shocked how short it looked. Then he tells me \"don't focus on if u hair is even by an inch or so. You're young That's what 70 year old women do. \" I laughed because I was shocked but how disrespectful!! What kind of stylist says don't worry if your hair is even!!! So my hair is way to short!

And add a star. This is one of those reviews, where you're not sure you want to divulge the information because you snottily don't want someone to have the same goodies as you (but I'm working through that selfishness people).JEROME CAN DO HAIR YALL!!!!! YAAASSSSSSSS! YAAASSSSSSS!Let me tell you, I woke up this morning a BRAND NEW WOMAN! Full thick hair, bounce, shine, style...that hair did everything but put my celebrity crush in bed next to me...and if I got my ass to CA, it could possibly do that too!I was super elated when I found an amazing eyebrow stylist...but now I have the \"it\" factor in the hair category, an amazing artist (hair is a true art). I'm not just looking for pretty hair. I want healthy, strong, and gorgeous hair. I can check that off the list. 2015...watch out!!!! So, run your happy asses to Magid's Hair Studio and ask for Jerome! ----------------------Okay there are so many conflicting views on here about this Salon. So as a long time client that has used three different stylists, let me give you my honest feedback: After 7 years, this salon is far from perfect and at times I've strayed away to visit other stylist to see if I could find better. The reason that I've comeback time and time again is because as a natural head, I needed long lasting results and for the most part I got that here. Magid aka \"Magic\": He's the owner and he was the very first stylist I went to prior to his current location. I believe that he's good at his craft for basic blow outs. Joseph (the brother): I love his personality, but more so, he is really talented with a flat iron. He listens to his clients and he cares about what they want. The case majority of photos on my yelp are blowouts from him! I ended up being Joseph's client for the last 5+ years. Jerome: On a recommendation from Joseph, I wanted more creativity with my natural hair. My hair had finally reached a really great length and constant blowouts for me were not a way of necessarily retaining the length. I really love Jerome's capability and understanding with natural hair. I feel so confident about having more control of my hair shed, my product knowledge, and making sure that at the end of the day I have the healthiest head of hair possible. He's now my main stylist and I'm really happy. The Cons: - I personally don't think this is the type of salon you come to for custom color or for any other style aside from a simple blow out. - if you want the latest cut, I don't think it's going to be here either. They really just specialize in natural hair. It's the bulk of their business. While individual stylists do varying degrees of stuff, recognize the overall capabilities of the salon. - I don't get perms/relaxers or any color from here. Wait actually once I did get color, but it was minimal and I honestly can't recall, but I was satisfied with the results. Honestly, I'd only go to a place that I KNEW specialized in it or did a significant amount of color in a week. - the one barber they have on staff is RUDE and HONORARY. He doesn't know how to respect women or keep a professional demeanor around clients. I literally took a star off, because I choose off days to avoid this man! This is a family owned business. The brothers are really great and they're kind. Advice: use sound judgement when deciding to get chemicals put in your head from a salon that has more business doing the opposite. You can expect to be in and out on time. The location is good and there's plenty of paid parking. Hair is a really finicky thing. Ask all the right questions before you agree to getting anything done.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 3, 8]}, "5": {"description": "I'm from LA just on vacation and I was looking to get some highlights done for new years.

The service is mediocre, but that's about the only thing I have to say about this place that isn't 100% positive. The presentation of the sushi is also very nice and the feel is authentic mixed with a classy feel. When I came here last Sunday I was treated to some really great sushi, I had the South Loop or Sloopin roll. It was excellent! It says it has spicy mayo, but it isn't even slightly spicy, and I normally can't handle any spice. I would highly recommend also the shrimp tempura roll. All delicious. All the time.

The sushi was very fresh, we were served promptly, and the ramen was great. We stopped in at around 530-6pm and were seated right away. Was surprised at how quickly the restaurant filled up considering it was Superbowl Sunday. We ordered the highly recommended spicy roasted garlic pork ramen, a half Chicago roll, a spicy scallop hand roll, and hamachi nigiri. The sushi was just mmmmmm =) so good. The hand roll was HUGE. Super stuffed with the spicy scallop mixture, and was very well balanced with the sauce and masago. The hamachi was so soft, and the Chicago roll was not as memorable, but was a great try off their menu. I really, really wanted to order more nigiri, especially after tasting how fresh and soft the hamachi was. But the ramen was quite filling, and the Chicago rolls are large rolls, not your avg size. The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the kitchen split our ramen order into two bowls after learning we were planning on sharing it, but I regretted this decision. The bowls are quite small, and the noodle amount the same, so you get a lot less broth than if you were to receive it in the original bowl. Next time, I'd just ask for a side bowl, and deal with splitting it ourselves. Also, the ramen was amazingggg just wished it didn't have SO MUCH bamboo shoots. I love them, the SO does not, so I usually end up eating all of them myself... and it was just way way too much.All in all, loved this little place.Excited that they're opening up a second location in the Lincoln Park area!

The soup was basically not spicy at all, which was annoying to me, since I ordered it and mentioned the spice as being important to me.

Just after the hostess seated us, the manager came over and offered a better table right next to the first one, which I appreciated.My Martini was nice. Not stand-and-applaud nice, but good. I'm a Martini snob and hard to please with my gin, so \"good\" is actually real praise. Gin selection was pretty standard so I chose Hendrix, the olives were crisp with no fillings, a cut above what I expect from most restaurants or bars. I didn't think to ask for it stirred so they shook it. Next time...Bread and oil clued us in that we'd made a good choice. The bread was fresh and firm but delicate, not fancied up with herbs and spices, likewise the oil. No nonsense, just quality.Our waiter took excellent care of us. There was a misunderstanding (or was it) about the glass of white my date ordered, so he comped us the first one he'd brought before bringing the one she did order. I have a hunch, no real basis for this, that the \"mistake\" was really more like, \"nah, have one of these.\" The first one was the one we finished.We each had salad. Generous portions but not overly huge trying to make a point like at some places, just good bowls of veggies. Perfectly fresh, with just the right amount of dressing. Spot on.The menu is long and varied, thoughtful Italian classic. We'd both had stressful days after a run of stressful weeks and I just couldn't make up my mind. All I knew was that I wanted a good glass of flavorful red wine along with a meal to go with it, so I asked for our waiter's recommendation on the wine. He nodded and said \"I'll bring you something nice.\" What to go with it, I asked? \"Meat.\" Uh well yeah okay, but... Without hesitation he suggested the t-bone. Fine, I'll have that! I don't eat a lot of red meat these days but if that's the recommendation...And, oh my goodness.What a steak. Big. Excellent quality, well marbled just the slightest hair toward fatty, tender, seasoned brilliantly. I ordered it rare and it came out just right. The side of white beans were seasoned to complement the steak in a rare and wonderful way. This was not some fancied-up dish trying to get into a trendy magazine, it was a classic Italian meal meant to please a hungry appetite, and oh did it.My date said her pasta was just a hair toward hard but otherwise fine. I can't say much else about it because I didn't try any, had my face too deeply buried in my meat. She tried a few bites, and nodded along with me.Dessert: apple pie with vanilla ice cream, as good as everything else, not an afterthought like desserts can sometimes seem to be. Even the berries next to it were carefully selected.I had a shot of espresso that made me grin. Like with gin, I'm hard to please with my coffee and this was terrific, just excellent, deep foamy crema, flavorful but not at all bitter.

My fianc\u00e9 and I are in our late 20's, and we can't help but feel like there's some sort of age discrimination going on with us being ignored while meanwhile the waiters joke around and chat with the older patrons.

Really fresh, crunchy yet savory and flavorful. The portion of both is so ample, there was more than enough to gorge and have enough to take home for later or the next day. Bread is fresh and tasty, fish is moist and delicious, fries are just plain wonderful. Blackie's is one of the few places that remains fabulous and consistent and open for business.

I have tried the pork sliders, the French burger, the poutine a la blackies, and the truffle mac n cheese (been here a few times, lol). -the poutine: truffle fries are good but these are just outrageously soggy and the egg doesn't do much other than conflict with the truffle flavor. \u00a0I love, love truffle flavor and the idea is good and the flavors are decent, just not well-executed.-the truffle mac n cheese - on a truffle vein...this is so bland!!! \u00a0It's not cheesy or creamy, it's just very plain and faint tasting. \u00a0-pork sliders - SO GOOD. \u00a0I got a few of these to share and subsequently refused to share. \u00a0They were just delicious, rich with flavor, and juicy. \u00a0Not too complicated, just right.-French burger - the patty itself was good, and nicely cooked, but despite the myriad of ingredients, the burger itself was unremarkable in terms of taste.In terms of atmosphere: the patio is lovely and I don't necessarily mind the inside, but why is it so dark? \u00a0It makes blackies seem...dirty, and I feel like that's (hopefully) not the case. Also, the decor inside is so fun and you can hardly see it!Service: to be honest, the service is never great here. \u00a0The servers and bar staff are very cold and often take a while with checks or checking on you. \u00a0I don't mind that much but it's not a great impression! \u00a0I also don't understand the rudeness of the comments that the owner makes on people's reviews. \u00a0If I hadn't seen those, I'd probably keep going to blackies - its location is nice and the beer is cheap. \u00a0However, the response from the owner to a lot of these people leaves a pretty sour taste in my mouth, despite the good taste of the food and I don't know if I want to support a business owner that does that...having worked in the restaurant industry for most of my life, he doesn't seem like someone I'd want to work for. \u00a0PS I'm sure I will also get a rude response for this commentary? \u00a0I try to keep my reviews pretty unbiased. \u00a0I like Blackies but it's definitely got room to improve! \u00a0Further, to address things you may say/ seem to say a lot, Jeff T, I can assure you that 1.

He took a long time to come by each time we needed something even though the dining room was less than 10% full. \u00a0 The place was dead when we were there during dinner time, 7:30pm on a Saturday evening, prime time which was ominous sign.The only reason we went was because I had purchased a coupon, the only rules on the coupon was the bill had to be over $50, with tax and tip not included in the $50 total. I satisfied the requirements, but the waiter came back and said my alcoholic drink (glass of wine) could not be included in the $50 total and I was $10 short. I told him there was no requirement stating alcoholic drinks could not be used. He still said I was $10 dollars short, I ask to speak to the owner, but I was told he was not available.I felt they were trying to jack up my bill, I did not argue or complain but not happy with my experience here one bit. I did not order any more food, just paid my bill and left.I tried calling the restaurant several times over the next few days, the owner I was told, was never available.

The best part? The 5 minute head massage...it was incredible. I am tempted to make another appointment just for a full 60 minute repeat of that. Keep in mind that this place is NOT a spa. It does not look or feel like a spa...and that is not their goal; it feels like a nice West Loop chiropractor.

based on yelp reviews \u00a0(which is why I'm reviewing this now) and because it seemed like they had a good 'whole' approach that included physical therapy and massage along with adjustments. \u00a0I knew that I would need more than the average \"crack and go' since I had been experiencing lower back issues for quite some time, without too much success with other treatments.The staff was always very nice and accommodating throughout the months that i went to PBH, with the physical therapist truly being the best part of the three headed approach. \u00a0Massage was good, but it was a revolving door of staff, which wasn't the best thing when you're trying to build on the last session. \u00a0Starting over with someone new, especially some of the less experienced people right out of school was totally a waste of time. \u00a0There were a few therapists there however that made that 30 minutes of the visit worth it.One thing that was pretty annoying was having to actually tell the massage therapists what to do each and every time you had a massage. \u00a0There should have been more communication between the doctors and the massage therapists. \u00a0I understand how important feedback is, but I shouldn't be directing you at all in a place that prides itself on a complete 'treatment' - if i knew what to do, my pain would have been gone long ago.This part of my experience, just smelled like is was built for people to milk their insurance into paying for a massage that made them feel good, but not something that was actually part of a recovery program. \u00a0A couple therapists were really fantastic and knew what they were doing when it came to muscular structure and how it played a role in your ailment, the others were barely different than getting a massage school session at Cortiva for $40.Anyway, from the beginning, the doctor laid out a plan and assured me that there was no reason that she thought I wouldn't see relief if i committed to the schedule she laid out (which miraculously, lined right up with the exact amount my insurance would cover for 'one instance' of treatment).That's fine, all I'm looking for at this point is a solution. \u00a0So i committed, and three months later, I was not all that much different than when i walked in the door for the first time.That said, I get the fact that these people aren't going to be able to solve every problem, everyone has. \u00a0It's just the nature of what they do. \u00a0If you're arm is broken, no matter how much massage, PT and chiropractic 'adjustment' you get, you're arm is still going to be broken. \u00a0What bothered me most about this place, was that by the time we were coming to the end of my treatment plan, the input from the doctor was less and less frequent. \u00a0It was as if they could smell the well drying up. \u00a0To the point, where we actually scheduled and followed through with an MRI to get a closer look at my problem, that was met with indifference on the part of PBH. \u00a0When i came in for my last session, i had my adjustment, my massage, and that was it. \u00a0No exit consultation, no real suggestions on what next steps for me could be, seemingly, and truly, absolutely no concern for me and my recovery. \u00a0A very nice smile and see you later, but nothing that I expected. \u00a0After working with a small group of folks for that many months, seeing them 3 times a week, there was one massage therapist and one physical therapist that were great and seemed to have true concern about what i could do there, and outside of there, to help my situation. \u00a0Other than that, including the two main doctors, you're just a number...and that number coincides with what your insurance is willing to cough up for you.If you're looking for some sort of surface level massage/chiropractic type session, that is more relaxing than anything and your issue is slight or basic maintenance, this place is probably fine. \u00a0If your issue is a little deeper than something a basic massage can't clear up and you're looking for someone to really delve into your issue and spend time and effort trying to find a solution with you, you should probably look to someone that will actually spend the time to find a solution with you instead of just putting you into the same routine they put everyone else into, hoping it'll fix your issue.To PBH, if you can't fix someone's issue, it would be nice for you to put together some sort of exit consultation where you could outline some potential next pathways.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 7, 11]}, "17":

if i knew what to do, my pain would have been gone long ago.This part of my experience, just smelled like is was built for people to milk their insurance into paying for a massage that made them feel good, but not something that was actually part of a recovery program. \u00a0A couple therapists were really fantastic and knew what they were doing when it came to muscular structure and how it played a role in your ailment, the others were barely different than getting a massage school session at Cortiva for $40.Anyway, from the beginning, the doctor laid out a plan and assured me that there was no reason that she thought I wouldn't see relief if i committed to the schedule she laid out (which miraculously, lined right up with the exact amount my insurance would cover for 'one instance' of treatment).That's fine, all I'm looking for at this point is a solution. \u00a0So i committed, and three months later, I was not all that much different than when i walked in the door for the first time.That said, I get the fact that these people aren't going to be able to solve every problem, everyone has. \u00a0It's just the nature of what they do. \u00a0If you're arm is broken, no matter how much massage, PT and chiropractic 'adjustment' you get, you're arm is still going to be broken. \u00a0What bothered me most about this place, was that by the time we were coming to the end of my treatment plan, the input from the doctor was less and less frequent. \u00a0It was as if they could smell the well drying up. \u00a0To the point, where we actually scheduled and followed through with an MRI to get a closer look at my problem, that was met with indifference on the part of PBH. \u00a0When i came in for my last session, i had my adjustment, my massage, and that was it. \u00a0No exit consultation, no real suggestions on what next steps for me could be, seemingly, and truly, absolutely no concern for me and my recovery. \u00a0A very nice smile and see you later, but nothing that I expected. \u00a0After working with a small group of folks for that many months, seeing them 3 times a week, there was one massage therapist and one physical therapist that were great and seemed to have true concern about what i could do there, and outside of there, to help my situation. \u00a0Other than that, including the two main doctors, you're just a number...and that number coincides with what your insurance is willing to cough up for you.If you're looking for some sort of surface level massage/chiropractic type session, that is more relaxing than anything and your issue is slight or basic maintenance, this place is probably fine. \u00a0If your issue is a little deeper than something a basic massage can't clear up and you're looking for someone to really delve into your issue and spend time and effort trying to find a solution with you, you should probably look to someone that will actually spend the time to find a solution with you instead of just putting you into the same routine they put everyone else into, hoping it'll fix your issue.To PBH, if you can't fix someone's issue, it would be nice for you to put together some sort of exit consultation where you could outline some potential next pathways.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 7, 11]}, "15": {"description": "I got a few treatments after discovering the place via a Groupon massage. \u00a0The chiropractors and massage therapists were nice (which is why this is a 2 vs. 1 star review) but I'd give a 1 star primarily in response to the billing process. \u00a0When paying my balance due, I noticed that I was being charged for services I had already paid for (via Groupon and my HRA/FSA). \u00a0It was a $200 discrepancy which is why I noticed and I must have gone into the facility/called to inquire about the matter at least 5x but each time was told someone will look into it and get back to me. \u00a0They were nice about it but alas I never got a call back. \u00a0After a good 2 months of this back and forth I finally decided to go through my insurance to look into it/call proper balance on my behalf which seemed to resolve everything. \u00a0I've never experienced this sort of billing discrepancy with a medical practitioner before and I completely understand things happen but the lack of communication/responsiveness re the issue is what got to me. \u00a0Not sure if I'm a one-off case but just writing this review as a heads up for patients to maybe double check your statement here.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 8, 29]}, "7": {"description": "Had a massage here on a Groupon, not bad not great.

Then on my way there I dropped a polish since my hands were full. She scoffed and reminded me to pick it up once I sat down. No offer of tea or water - she did not introduce herself or even smile. Then, she asked if I wanted my nails short or long - I told her before I decided I wanted to see the colors. She curtly stated \"I asked you if you wanted them short or long.\" At that point I said, \"that's it, I want another nail tech or I'm leaving.\" At this point she finally looked at me and said \"fine, whatever.\" Someone else did my nails - unremarkable.When I left I complained to the receptionist. As I walked by the place when I left the woman was looking at me and laughing. Wow.Also, when I paid cash. I gave $25 for a 20$ bill. I expected to be brought back 5 singles. The manicurist kept all.

Not wanting to brave the usual suspects - Potbelly or Subway- I saw the sign for this outpost of Porkchop as I was crossing Dearborn. \u00a0I must have timed it right, as there was just one person ahead of me in line when I walked in. By the time I had finished my lunch, the crowd had picked up considerably. After studying the menu, I decided to keep it simple with a brisket sandwich. I noticed that chips were on offer, but none of the sides appealed, so I stuck with the sandwich. The brisket itself was delicious- tender and not fatty/gristly in the least. The sauce was solid, though I would have liked to be able to customize my sandwich with other types of sauce, possibly via squeeze bottles of the stuff set out on counters. I don't know if this is how things are run at the other locations, but I did not seem to see any free-range sauces here - even hot sauce. I had never had brisket served on a pretzel bun before - methinks it might be BBQ with a hipster twist - but I found the quality of the bread fairly tasty, if unexpected. The service was efficient, and pleasant, getting me in and out in good time for the afternoon's slate of Lit Fest events.

Check. You can find novels, literary journals, nonfiction, children's titles, and the usual categories you'd look for at Border's or B&N. Unlike those places, however, Sandmeyer's has an excellent selection of local history books. Whether you want a pictorial guide to the suburbs or historical fiction set in Chicago, you'll find it here. A discount program? Check. Sandmeyer's has one, just like the big chain stores, but they won't send you a million emails every day if you sign up for it.Helpful staff? Check. The guy at the register was happy to chat with me about their selection of literary journals, what they normally stock, when they get new ones in, etc. They're also happy to order things for you in many cases.Here are some things Sandmeyer's has that your typical chain store does not: location in a beautiful building in Chicago's historic Printer's Row, proximity to numerous places to grab lunch and read your new book, and excellent displays of the new Penguin books with the beautiful covers, including the great ideas series. The publishing industry as well as bricks and mortar book stores are allegedly in crisis, but Sandmeyer's reminds me of all the reasons I walk into a real store and buy a book instead of downloading something onto an e-reader. The tactile experience of holding one of those new Penguin editions, a \"curated\" selection of books rather than a few suggestions generated by an algorithm, a staff member to recommend something if you can only buy one thing today but have your eye on three different titles, and yes, that wonderful paper and ink aroma. Plus, if you're like me and you sometimes drop your reading material while perusing it in the bathtub, you're only out $10, not $150+.Did I mention that Sandmeyer's is also convenient to public transit? It is! You can walk to this lovely building from the red, blue, brown, orange, and green lines, and if you don't mind a little walk, it's totally doable from the metra as well.In short, go to Sandmeyer's.

I went into this 7-Eleven at 12:45am last night, 7-18-2015. I held the door open for a lady as I entered. I was only in the store to buy a 6pack of beer for friends visiting and waiting for me back at Hotel Blake across the street, so I headed straight for the cooler, picked my beer, and went to the counter. I had zero - ZERO - contact with the lady I opened the door for after doing so. Security cameras can back this up if need be. We arrived separately, were on opposite ends of the store - she was a total stranger, and very observable so if ANY kind of attention or observation was being made.I had my ID upfront upon catching the clerk's attention to purchase my item, and he asked to see the IDs of the \"rest of my group\". I came in alone. I held a door for a woman, and made zero contact once in the store. I explained this, rather incredulously, to the clerk, but he denied the sale regardless.

I see on your website that you train your employees \"how to observe guests and their behavior to determine whether age-restricted products can be sold\", but I'm wondering how having basic manners counts to make me suspicious and worthy of being denied service. Obviously, this isn't about being denied one silly 6 pack of beer: It's the fact that the only explanation I can see for this kind of reasoning from your clerk is blatant abuse of power in denying customers at random (sexism? homophobia? sorry I don't look like the most feminine woman out there??? grasping at straws because there was no other *reason*), or a total failure in how you \"train\" your employees to observe the sales they make and customers they come across.I'd very much like to know how this clerk in particular (12:45am, 7-18, Saturday night - bigger guy with longer, brown hair) reached his conclusion, and how 7-Eleven backs up random denial of sales based on unsubstantial reason.

It was one of the best culinary decisions we have ever made to try out a new place! The tasting was more than enough for two average sized people. The waiters were so courteous, informative and just truly added to the wonder of the epicurean adventure. Beers were really awesome and staff was knowledgeable about all aspects of dining. Our first course was a charcuterie board with the most amazing chicken pate ever! Really delicious hams and pickled goodies too. Second course was a corn cake and veggies which wasn't my fave. Too bland. Third course was a seafood hotpot with langoustines and fish and like a fish stew of sorts. Delicious! Third course we picked was the beef tenderloin cooked to perfection. Then a raspberry topped cheesecake for dessert. All courses paired with beers to compliment the dish. Presentation and cleanliness were top notch. Service professionalism absolutely wonderful. Decor minimal: the space was inviting and cozy. Prices reasonable and good portions. Bar scene was very laid back. A great family place or date or just out with friends kinda night....

I purposely waited a bit after my experience cause I was so disappointed. As a long time Printers Row/South Loop resident, I admittedly had high expectations for Villains. Not in the sense that I wanted a new place to go, but in the sense that this section of Clark is going through a rebirth. Places like First Draft, the new condos, and now Villains will hopefully bring this section of Printers Row up to the standard that exists two streets over on Dearborn. I'd comment on Blackies as a contributor, but that's just hopeless. I was a bit disappointed in my first visit. First, the menu is highly complicated for the customers in this neighborhood. I get that they are trying to be \"organic,\" \"local,\" \"authentic midwestern,\" etc, but come on, when the cheese plate and the burger are the only things recognizable on the menu, there is a problem. \u00a0My wife order the cheese plate since she wasn't feeling the burger but nobody seemed to really know what the cheeses were. Their response was \"this is an international one.\" The Fromage Gods are shuttering! While my burger was good, it wasn't great considering the price point. Yeah yeah, I get that it that the burgers are hand made, but I'm not paying that much for bacon cheese burger. I will say the beer menu was extensive, although somewhat unrecognizable. Across the street at First Draft you find 60+ taps of names you know and love. The same thing is true for Bar Louie, Kaseys, Hackneys, and even Flacos. At Villains, it's a crap shoot. You order one and hopefully it meets your expectations. However, again, like the burger, the prices were high. Well, according to the management, not high enough since they crossed out the old prices and hand wrote in higher ones in pen (note my photo of the beer menu with the magically changed prices). \u00a0 The service was spotty at best, which is shocking since they don't really seem busy. I get that they just opened, but when the staff gloats that they \"worked at the old Villains\" and have a \"fantastic chef\" there is a certain expectation of competency that they failed to exhibit. Don't hype yourself up until you're ready! This is a tough f&b town and many of us despise arrogance in our dining and drinking experience. Take the humble road and you'll be successful.

I purposely waited a bit after my experience cause I was so disappointed. As a long time Printers Row/South Loop resident, I admittedly had high expectations for Villains. Not in the sense that I wanted a new place to go, but in the sense that this section of Clark is going through a rebirth. Places like First Draft, the new condos, and now Villains will hopefully bring this section of Printers Row up to the standard that exists two streets over on Dearborn. I'd comment on Blackies as a contributor, but that's just hopeless. I was a bit disappointed in my first visit. First, the menu is highly complicated for the customers in this neighborhood. I get that they are trying to be \"organic,\" \"local,\" \"authentic midwestern,\" etc, but come on, when the cheese plate and the burger are the only things recognizable on the menu, there is a problem. \u00a0My wife order the cheese plate since she wasn't feeling the burger but nobody seemed to really know what the cheeses were. Their response was \"this is an international one.\" The Fromage Gods are shuttering! While my burger was good, it wasn't great considering the price point. Yeah yeah, I get that it that the burgers are hand made, but I'm not paying that much for bacon cheese burger. I will say the beer menu was extensive, although somewhat unrecognizable. Across the street at First Draft you find 60+ taps of names you know and love. The same thing is true for Bar Louie, Kaseys, Hackneys, and even Flacos. At Villains, it's a crap shoot. You order one and hopefully it meets your expectations. However, again, like the burger, the prices were high. Well, according to the management, not high enough since they crossed out the old prices and hand wrote in higher ones in pen (note my photo of the beer menu with the magically changed prices). \u00a0 The service was spotty at best, which is shocking since they don't really seem busy. I get that they just opened, but when the staff gloats that they \"worked at the old Villains\" and have a \"fantastic chef\" there is a certain expectation of competency that they failed to exhibit. Don't hype yourself up until you're ready! This is a tough f&b town and many of us despise arrogance in our dining and drinking experience. Take the humble road and you'll be successful.

They opened the windows, had a pretty diverse menu, and made their establishment look modern, elegant, and comfortable to attract the yuppie population of the Printers Row / South Loop area and beyond. Well, the problem is that the busier they became the worse their food and service became as well. On any given Sunday you will see a crowd of people standing in their lobby and outside of their doors waiting upwards of 60 minutes to be called in for a table - for what \"breakfast food\"? The last three times I've eaten here the food has been progressively worse. Yesterday, my friend and I attempted to dine here. Notice the word \"attempted\" in this sentence, because I ordered an omelette and my friend ordered a flat-bread dish. After 40 minutes our food was not served, so my friend insisted that the waitress bring out my food even if hers wasn't ready. I said,\"Why would my food be ready, if I ordered an omelet there's no way they cooked mine first if we are at the same table, right?\" \u00a0Moments later the waitress delivered a cold omelet to my table and dried out potatoes that looked like they were the left overs from someone else's plate. I mentioned that the food was cold and the waitress just stood there like her IQ was below average with a blank stare on her face. Not wanting to rock the boat, I ate the omelet and made the decision - okay, I'm not coming back here again. 30 minutes later - YES, we are talking one hour and ten minutes later my friend finally said,\"I'd like to cancel the flat-bread it's been over an hour and it's still not out.\" The waitresses in an very unconcerned tone said,\"Okay.\" No apology, no offer to resolve it, nor did they offer to get the manager to see if there was something they could do to save the experience. I paid my bill for the cold omelet, and tipped and walked out - never to return again. My friend left hungry and decided to eat elsewhere. Here's the clincher they weren't even busy! They had more staff walking around than they had customers. This incident occurred at 3:30 pm when they had no more than six customers in the entire place, so what else were they doing if they weren't preparing food? The real problem here is when a business starts making large amounts of money, generating a lot of buzz, selling out tables week after week they get a little foolish and start thinking their place will always be as busy as it once was - false! Several people that I know experienced the same thing and I'm under the impression that they won't be doing so well in the coming months.

Also challenging was that the plates were narrow ovals each covered with a much larger swath of wax paper. Because they weren't sized or fit together, food or ketchup on the paper would start to drift off the plate and start dribbling on the counter.On the way in, the dessert case had several options that looked good, and we ordered carrot cake and coffee. The carrot cake really was delicious, but they only brought one fork even though we ordered just one dessert between the two of us and specifically mentioned that we were looking to share it. It took a while for the dessert to arrive although it wasn't clear why, given the lack of crowd and the fact that it was coming from the case at the end of the bar. We waited to start eating the dessert until the coffee arrived, but when the bar attendant returned several minutes after bringing the carrot cake, she didn't have any coffee. When we asked her about it, she apologized and mentioned that she simply forgotten the order. She then poured it from the station that was right next to where she was standing when we ordered it the first time.Other things we noticed when we compared notes afterward were that the dessert menu didn't mention many of the items in the dessert case in front, and the chalkboard specials menu had a few misspellings. To be clear, the hostess and staff at the bar were extremely friendly and polite, but the experience accumulated a lot of disappointments that could have been helped by better management and better attention to detail. Given our experience, we were honestly surprised at the many positive reviews it has on Yelp (but at not the spotty service) but perhaps Meli is stronger with brunch, or sometimes its kitchen isn't on its A game.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 7, 19]}, "20": {"description": "I've been here several times and have really enjoyed this place. \u00a0Huge portions at fair prices with a ton of variety! \u00a0What more could you want? \u00a0(I suppose the service could be a bit better, but I haven't had any huge issues other than inattentive servers). \u00a0In any event, try the caprese wrap!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 12, 21]}, "36": {"description": "Meli isn't amazing but it's reliable and nice.

Explanation: I chose this place based on the excellent reviews, but I got my hair cut here today and my experience was sub-par. There were two issues with my cut and color, A) a miscommunication about what I wanted and B) how it was handled.I came in and asked for an ombre that could be added to my existing dark roots and reddish colored hair (my hair is dark brown). Ahmed told me that what I wanted couldn't be done. He spent 10 minutes talking about a different way to do the ombre that I didn't really understand, and I asked for clarification. He said that he would add color to the bottom of my hair, I said fine.An hour and a half later, he was finally done applying the color. He washed it out and when I looked in the mirror I saw that my hair was BLONDE. My hair is very dark and this was NOT what we had agreed to. I was upset because it looked terrible. I said \"This is a lot blonder than I was expecting.\" Ahmed immediately became very defensive and said \"You think this is the end of what it looks like? This is only part one of the process, I told you that.\" No, no he had NOT explained that it was a two step dye process and that it would take upwards of THREE hours to dye. I explained that I had not understood that, as I had never had an ombre take longer than 2 hours before, or take more than one dye, or use BLEACH on my hair. I have had ombre done every 6 months for the last 5 years at many, many places. He said that every other stylist I've ever gone to had done it wrong, and you have to bleach hair first to \"lift\" the color, and then tone it to the correct color. He lectured me about \"lifting\" and \"bleaching,\" how he had told me that this was going to be the process, and that everyone else had done it wrong for at least 10 more minutes. I explained that I had not understood this, and did not know it was going to take 3 hours to complete, so I had to reschedule an appointment I had that was coming up in 30 min. Ahmed then let me pick out the color to tone my hair, and had another woman in the salon wash it out. While she was washing my hair she said \"I heard you were freaking out about your hair being blonde\" in a very judgmental tone. Ok, I misunderstood about the process of the dyeing - I accept some blame for that. But to tell the client to her FACE that in effect you had been gossiping about her behind her back and laughing about her freaking out for something she didn't understand? It was incredibly rude and it made me even more upset.THEN I sat down in the chair for Ahmed to cut my hair and he asked what I did for a living. I told him and he said \"So what would you do if I came to you in your industry and told you that everything you were doing was wrong?\" Now this made me SO mad because he was insinuating that I said \"This is wrong, you are doing this incorrectly.\" ALL I said was \"this is more blonde than I expected.\" So he was basically accusing me of accusing him which is NOT what happened. I felt very attacked. I explained that the issue was that I misunderstood, and that I never accused him of being wrong or doing it incorrectly. The problem was just that neither the process nor the time investment were explained to me.Ahmed did give me $30 off and try to give me free shampoo, but these things were way too little too late. Again, the issue wasn't with the hair because it turned out not blonde (although the technique was not great, because the dye is streaky and poorly blended in many places). The issue was with the way he handled it. If he had simply said \"I'm sorry I didn't explain what what happening, this is what we're going to do\" I would have been totally fine. Instead, he got very defensive and attacked me and was very rude. I'm glad that so many other people have had good experiences here, but I was treated terribly and would not sink FOUR TOTAL HOURS into a haircut again, even if it were great (which it wasn't).", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 11, 20]}, "32": {"description": "Emad has been styling my hair for 4 years.

There is nothing these guys cannot do! One thing I love about them, no matter what style you choose to go with they will tell you why it will or won't work for you. And 9 times out of 10 their suggestion is better than what you wanted. They are good at what they do! They understand that not every \"trend\" will \"work\" for you but, they always have an idea that will blow you mind and you will leave the shop 100% satisfied. Now if you need someone to do your significant other's hair. AHMED is the guy you want! He too has dealt with my \"I want my boyfriend to have this hair style\" all i have to do is show him a picture or try to explain what \"we\" want and he will work his magic (Let's be honest when I say \"we\" I mean me, my boyfriend could care less on what hairstyle I choose for him) he says; \"as long as you like it, I like it\"... That's a lie, he secretly loves it when someone compliments his hair style. (He willNever admit it, and I'm ok with that) Oh! Don't be fooled, Ahmed is a hair stylist! He also does women's hair. Just like Mish and Emad. Let's not forget they offer nails and skin care! Your go to girls are MIRA and NINA. These ladies couldn't be nicer, and they are good at what they do! For someone who is as picky as me I highly suggest you give them a try. They will not disappoint! Trio3's assistant JAY is an asset to the shop, she is friendly, attentive and makes you feel welcomed. As someone who has worked in customer service for years I'm very picky. Going to Trio3's hair salon is my go to shop! And yes, I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 9, 16]}, "44": {"description": "I love this place...1) While getting the best manicure ever I watched the stylist cut hair to perfection! I saw men walking out of there with perfect haircuts. I liked looking at themselves in the mirror with a surprised look on their faces! Amazing technique and excellent styles! 2) They worked on diverse hair textures with the same enthusiasm. I saw an African American woman with thick course waist length hair get a blow out and a trim (looked amazing). The same stylist cut a White mans hair and the guy was beaming in the mirror at his reflection. A moment later a woman with curly red hair came in and he cut and styled her into a bushy bob that once again caused a glowing beaming smile and multiple thank you's.3) I was there for spa services. The spa pedicure is long, because they take their time and make everything perfect. The manicures were also lengthy, because she soaked my hands with a towel, gave me a massage and did the maintenance work that they do on the cuticles. Not only does this place look great...

After, he taught me how to style and care for my hair; I could tell as he shared with me his instructions how passionate he is about his craft and how much he cares about his clients' satisfaction.

Space and seating is very limited but the patrons were nice and it can get crowded. If you don't crowds this definitely isn't the place but if you love beer then this is the place. The beer selection is pretty awesome and if you need water just order a $3 Miller Lite during happy hour. The bartenders are pretty cool there too.

My friends and I decided to check out this bar about a month ago based off the great reviews on yelp. When we first arrived we were slightly confused because there is the bar and then there are tables. Since there was a group of four of us we chose the tables. What made this process confusing was that we waited for several minutes but no one came to serve us, so we were not sure if we had to go up to the bar or wait an eternity to come serve us. That was more so awkward than a huge deal, we just went up to the bar and ordered. We loved the beer and the environment and were overall having a great time. Towards the end of our time there, we noticed that the table behind us was getting service but not us, but at this point we did not care. I asked the man (his name is Craig with a \"C\" as he later bluntly told me) for our check. When he arrived with the check, he had added my boyfriend and my bill with our friends' bill. When we asked about this, as we had all ordered separately he stated that it was easier for the bar to do so. This was perplexing to me especially because there were no signs around stating this was the policy. I asked Craig for a pen so I could circle who had what. Craig hastily stated that he could just be informed of how we wanted to split the bill. However, when I began to tell him he rolled his eyes and then requested we split the items. After a few minutes of attempting to remember and almost calculating whose was whose, Craig returned and ripped the check out of my friend's hand and stated that this was not \"rocket science\" and stormed off. When Craig returned, I asked to speak to the manager due to the unbelievable amount of disrespect he had now shown us and I was told that he was the manager that night! I asked him why he had been rude to us this entire time and he stated that he had not because he had only started serving us (giving away his awful service once again). Needless to say he continued to argue with me until I finally requested to speak with his boss. In the end he continued to make errors on the separation of the check and did not even give my friend his card back originally. Also Craig was taking shots behind the bar, which is absolutely unprofessional especially if you are the manager. Although I have not called his boss, I am writing about my experience here.

Refried beans, choice of fresh tomato salsa or roasted green salsa. \u00a0I had both and the green had a nice light kick and lots of extra flavor. \u00a0Green is the way to go here. \u00a0Cheddar cheese and ground beef. \u00a0Then out of the oven finished with queso fresco and cilantro. \u00a0 \u00a0It would have been a 5 for me if it had black olives. \u00a0Worth a repeat visit for sure.-Buffalo Chicken Wrap 3 out of 5 stars - Maybe 4. This think was delicious and loaded with chicken. \u00a0It's just I wish it was freshly fried chicken then diced, sauced, and served. \u00a0I realized that would take more time but with how good this tasted with the breaded chicken being soft, I can imagine it would be a 5 out of 5 with freshly cooked chicken.-Meatball sandwich 4 out of 5 stars - 3 nice size meatballs with proper amounts of seasoning. I hate it when a meatball is JUST a ball of meat. \u00a0These had plenty of seasoning and the sauce that it was tossed in was full of flavor as well. Visable chunks of olive, garlic, and capers.-Roast Beef and Swiss sandwich 4 out of 5 stars - This had to be at least 1/4lb of roast beef. Nice size sandwich and a nice assortment of ripe veggies to choose from as toppings. \u00a0I went basic lettuce, tomato, onion with the horseradish sauce. $1 more added a nice large side of fresh fruit.-Gryos Pizza (daily special) 4 out of 5 stars. - I was brave here. \u00a0I love gyros, one of my favorite foods, but as a pizza? \u00a0Cheese pizza made with seasoned lamb topping and onions. After it comes out of the oven it was dressed with the Cucumbers and Tomatoes and Tzatziki sauce. Nice melody of flavors but the tomato sauce overpowered the fresh veggies a little bit. \u00a0Not bad but I might as for less sauce or olive oil brushed on instead next time. That and likely ask to pay for extra meat. \u00a0-Burger, 3 out of 5 - \u00a0I think the other reviews are being a bit harsh. The taste of the burger was good but yes, it shrinks too much. They are hand formed but after cooking they shrink together making a thick patty that doesn't even cover the bun fully.**Update. 4 out of 5 but ask to have the beef patty flattened so it's thinner and fills out the bun**-Sweet BBQ Chicken Quesadilla. 2 ouf of 5 stars - Sweet is correct, no real spice hear. \u00a0Was hoping for a more falvorful chicken, like blackened or marinated. \u00a0Appeard to just be diced grilled chicken. \u00a0Very messy once the sauce was added. \u00a0A fork and knife meal. \u00a0It won't hold together eating it with your hands.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 6, 17]}, "2": {"description": "Absolutely Horrible!!!!

The fries are god awful, no flavor, no salt. I'm severely disappointed. I've also had the flavorless terribly dry pizza and a sandwich from the deli. Save your money go some place else.

Several TVs showed a variety of sporting events, and our high-top table was surprisingly roomy and comfortable. The bar filled up later, so I recommend grabbing a table before 6 on Friday nights.Our server was friendly but confused not only about when the specials happened (she wasn't aware there was a Bulls game that night) but which beers were offered at $4. We asked her to list them and she mentioned a few then vaguely pointed to our menus. Most of her sentences ended with sound effects. She seemed to infer that any 16oz beer would be offered at $4, so some of the ones I ended up ordering were full price. Not only that, they were served in 12oz glasses, which was confusing and disappointing.The food was worth our time, though. The honey-sriracha porksicles were tender and lovely with just the right amount of heat.

Normally we'd wander and see where we ended up, but it was pouring outside with no sign of stopping. We ducked under a construction awning and pulled up Yelp, and First Draft sounded like an excellent place to kill time.When we arrived, there were only a couple people at the bar and a large table full at the back, so we didn't feel like we needed to rush at any time to clear the table. We started with a couple of drinks and poutine - fries, beer gravy, queso, and brisket. The fries were a bit undercooked but the rest of the dish was tasty. We had another drink and chit-chatted and watched the ten TVs in our vicinity - this would be a great place to watch a game. After another hour or so we decided to put in our dinner order. My boyfriend built his own burger, and I went with the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich, subbing cheddar for American. Delicious. The chicken was moist, the cheddar melty, and the pickles crisp. The fries were much better this time, though I only ate a few due to my previous poutine gorge and being full from the large sandwich and drinks beforehand. Customer service at First Draft was great - our server was attentive but wasn't pushing us to order or move along. On our way, I flagged down a bus boy and asked if he could get us two large trash bags for the rain. He did, and they were a life-saver until we found ponchos (and, frankly, a boon even after - the poncho/garbage bag combo ended up being crucial).

I took me a while to pick my favorite flavor (cheesecake) and we provided to talk about the vaporizer itself. They were not pushy at all about trying to selling you the most expensive devices. They took time to figure out what I wanted and my budget. (Bigger battery vs smaller one, size of tanks, etc)2. Follow up visits were great/ Staff is coolI dropped by a few times after the initial visit to ask more questions/ buy more e-juice. They were always very friendly and helpful. Sasha is cool and very approachable. Stephanie is kind and also cool. The staff in general is pretty laid back and chill. I like the vibe the shop and staff exhibits.3. Great pricesI did simple price matches online and their prices are actually cheaper than a lot of online websites. It's unbelievable.

Great experience when purchasing my first vaporizerBeing a noob and all, the staff were very patient with my questions. I was invited to check out all the flavors at the little flavor lounge area. I took me a while to pick my favorite flavor (cheesecake) and we provided to talk about the vaporizer itself. They were not pushy at all about trying to selling you the most expensive devices. They took time to figure out what I wanted and my budget. (Bigger battery vs smaller one, size of tanks, etc)2. Follow up visits were great/ Staff is coolI dropped by a few times after the initial visit to ask more questions/ buy more e-juice. They were always very friendly and helpful. Sasha is cool and very approachable. Stephanie is kind and also cool. The staff in general is pretty laid back and chill. I like the vibe the shop and staff exhibits.3. Great pricesI did simple price matches online and their prices are actually cheaper than a lot of online websites. It's unbelievable.

First off all, when you walk into the place, it's less like a 'store' and more like you've just been invited to hang out at a friends house. I walked in and was immediately invited to have a seat on the couch and try the flavor selection, which by the way was amazing! They make their own liquids, and they have a nice selection to choose from. The strawberry cheesecake was my favorite followed by sweetyhearts as a close second. They allowed me to sit there as long as I wanted; there was never any pressure to buy or to hurry and finish trying the flavors. They would come over periodically to see if I had any questions and to see how I liked the product and offer suggestions. Ross was the main person helping me that day, and I must say that his customer service skills are impeccable. He was attentive from the time I walked in until I walked out (and I probably was there a good hour and a half). He helped me choose flavors and helped me select a new device (which took some time considering I'm a newbie to the vaping community and had lots of questions). He even assembled it for me once I purchased it.

I dropped in one day to get something random, I can't even remember what I needed. Maybe coils?I got the stuff I needed in a pinch and went back home with a business card and a small chat with the person working. A couple weeks later I broke my battery and my back up is an old piece of junk. So I went in and picked up a battery, but then thought I should try some juice since I had the time and wanted to try another flavor. So I picked up a couple bottles of this and that and went home. Well, when I got home, the bottles I was given were wrong. I called the store immediately. After talking to them, they said I could bring it back so about a few days later when I was back in the neighborhood I stopped in. They exchanged it and gave me a little sample bottle. Awesome! Definitely wasn't expected but it was a great gesture. They'll have repeat business from me and the juice that I got that I originally wanted (haha) was fantastic and rich.
