So I order 2 kids meals, but later notice Ive been charged 3.69 for one and 3.29 for the other. I go up to the register and ask the cashier how much the kids meals were, and she says \"theyre 1.99 after 4pm.\" I got these at 5pm and I show my recipt to show the overcharge. She asks the girl who took my order about it, and said person comes over like she couldnt have been bothered about this, even though it was her f.n mistake in the first place. She opens up the register and gives me 2 dollars and leaves. This is less than Im owed. I should have explained to her (sloooowly) that 3.69-1.99=1.70, and 3.29-1.99=1.30, for a total of 3.00. So I let the first girl know that I ordered 2 kids meals and what I am owed is more than 2 dollars. She calls the second girl again and tells her. Moody comes and does the same again, opens the register and rudely pushes 2 dollars at me. First, she gave me too little back and then she gives me too much back, but the obvious part about this is that shes the one who made the mistake in the first place, but has a nasty attitude when shes politely told about it.

Neat old dive bar as you walk in the door. Smallish old bar with a couple of TVs around the room and a couple of bar-height tables scattered about. Won't hold a ton of people but makes for a nice and familiar watering hole to enjoy a few drinks or wait for a table in the attached dining area right off the bar. The menu in the dining room was filled with fish and seafood choices...with some chicken, hamburgers, and ribs offered. They seem to really specialize in fried foods...whether chicken or potatoes or breaded green beans. We went for the fried perch dinner and the crab cakes. The fried perch was the hit of the evening...nicely done little filets with a light breading...the dinner included little quarter cups of cottage cheese, cole slaw, and tartar sauce...two pieces of marbled rye, and a handful of fries. The guy who ordered the crab cakes - me - should have known better, i.e. you really don't go into a Polish emporium and order crab cakes. But be that as it may ... out came three crab cakes deep fried...and the chef put a dollop of butter on top of each cake after they were fried...this proceeded to melt down and accomplish two things: 1...the cake was very greasy and you got slippery lips and 2...the extra butter ran down to the bottom of the plate and sat there for the French fries to swim in. Not good - but half my fault for ordering it in the first place. Service was mixed up...all the people are very nice with a heart of gold but Waitress A didn't know which tables Waitress B was serving and vice versa. We waited for a long time in this narrow little room before anyone thought to ask us if we had been served. Oh well...topped off the night. Everyone gets a small bowl of pickled beets even before you order dinner. They offer no desserts. They only serve dinner on Wednesdays and Fridays. The bar area is open every day.

I eat there once or twice a year when I'm stuck in the area. Not much thought goes into the menu, or service, or customer satisfaction. Usually open for dinner on Wed. & Friday, \u00a0unless it corresponds with a holiday, or vacation, or a party, or..? I've had the chicken, which is decent, comes with a couple of fries. If you get chicken to go, your fries will be soggy. I've had the basa (fried fish) special, which is advertised as \"all you can eat\", although that depends on whether the manager/cook wants to close up early and go home, then it's \"all you can eat till I say when\". \u00a0The first plate had 3 basa filets on top of a couple of fries on a very small plate, so the filets were hanging off the side. Since the fries were UNDER the fish, the condensation made the fries wet and soggy, and made the breading fall off the fish and made THAT soggy. Subsequent filets without fries were crisp. They serve cocktail sauce with their white fish (????). But you can ask for tartar sauce. If you complain, you MAY get an argument from the manager.So, if you live in Hegewisch, don't feel like going far, realize what you're getting, this place might be for you. SOME parking.

They filet all of it themselves. They also serve chicken, steaks, ribs, pork chops, sandwiches, and apps. I had the walleye and fried chicken. The walleye was lightly battered, the flavor of the fish coming through, and brushed with butter for some of the tastiest fried fish around. I haven't had fried chicken in years, but went back for seconds and thirds, it was great. Everything has a from-scratch feel to it. Rye bread from a local bakery is always available.

There are mouse dropping everywhere including on the cooking surfaces and I spotted mice on multiple occasions. As for the bar, upon being \"trained\" I was asked to save all bottles that would be considered top shelf or premium such as grey goose, patron, bacardi etc. Why would you save bottles you ask, so they can re-fill them with well vodka, rum, gin, and tequila. The well that they use is Bellows which costs about 6 dollars a bottle. I do not understand how a shady buisness like this manages to keep their liqour license.

This address is for their take-out pizza place in Hegewisch...The frozen pizza is actually made in Cal City. This is the real, fresh, deal here!So, I grew up on the East Side (the southernmost neighborhood that borders the lake, not the\"new\" East Side which is just an extension of downtown), and there were pizza places aplenty: Bob & Jacks, Giappo's, Pucci's, Waldo Cooney, etc. At age 21, moved to Hegewisch (THE southeastern most neighborhood in Chicago) and was at a loss because I was so used to having Bob & Jack's on pizza night and suspected Hegewisch had nothing that lived up to B&J's. I was wrong.I think Doreen's is the best pizza on the Southeast Side. Yes, even better than the now-closed but much beloved Giappo's (which, yes, was pretty darn good but the service was awful!).So, at first glance, Doreen's appears to be another dime-a-dozen pizza/sandwich/Italian take-out place. I mean, they do serve pizza, sandwiches, pastas, salads, chicken, etc--but it's truly quality stuff! The thin-crust pizza is perfect: not cracker-thin, but not too bready, dusted with a little cornmeal, sauce has a nice tang to it, cheesy, sausage perfectly savory, and a nice little amount of grease on top. Call me crazy, but I like my takeout pizza a lil'greasy. I'm ordering takeout because I want to be bad!I've had their wings at parties and they're pretty tasty...Dig the Italian meatball sandwich...Mmm...So meaty! Lots of great choices for the hungry!I'm reviewing from a takeout standpoint since I lived about 2 blocks away so always picked up my order...They do offer delivery too, though! And, there are a few tables for eat-in if you choose...Although, it is pretty toasty in there from the pizza ovens and all. Not a lot of separation between the dining area and kitchen-quite small! And, yes, this is the same Doreen's you may see the frozen version of in your local grocery store. Except, they make those in Cal City. And I've never tried the frozen stuff--why when I have access to the real deal?Admittedly, I do not live in Hegewisch anymore so I don't get to enjoy Doreen's as often as I used to.

After eating that first bite of that nigh transparent crust with homemade sauce and good sausage piled on top, I felt like I had been missing something for all these years.Compared to all the other pizzas around the neighborhood, this one felt the most homemade and that was because of the sauce. Too many places around here use the same canned sauce and you can definitely taste the difference between Pudgy's and the rest. And that's the reason Pudgy's is beating every one else - in my estimation, good sauce equals good pizza. The whole experience of Pudgy's pizza was as close as I've come to my very favorite pizza in the world - Vito and Nick's - the best in Chicago. In fact, I'd say it compares quite favorably.So, in conclusion my Dad and I won't be ordering from any of the other places around the neighborhood anymore - at least one's that aren't named Pudgy's.", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 6, 5]}, "13": {"description": "Mmmmmmm....pudgy's.Just the name of this place made me think it was going to be good right off the bat...like I can just picture a bunch of slightly overweight chubby-cheeked Italian grandpas churning out some sweet homemade Chicago-style pies.

I ain't lyin'!Seriously though, every weird craving that could possibly go along with pizza that I have, they make. Like one time I was in the mood for pizza, but I wanted something a little spicy, too. Oh, hey! Pudgy's has a spicy hot specialty pizza made with hot sauce in their sweet homemade sauce recipe. SUPER!And then there was that time I couldn't decide between making a BLT or ordering a pizza. Well, Pudgy's has a BLT pizza made with real bacon (not the papa john's stuff) so, ya know, why susbstitute the real thing when you can have a super mega BLT-pizza combo!My personal favorite is \"Bob's Mistake\". I don't really know what mistake Bob made, but honey, thank goodness for his transgressions!\"Bob's Mistake\" is piled high with sausage, garlic, fresh tomatoes, and fresh red and green peppers and LOADED with lovely, lovely cheese.
