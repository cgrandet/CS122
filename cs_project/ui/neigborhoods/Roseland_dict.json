Many interesting things I learned about this americanized Chinese restaurant. I learned that the food here was cooked as soon as you ordered it. So it's not made and then reheated. Interestingly, the chef chops everything up himself, he doesn't believe in using any machines. The crab rangoons are the best I've ever had; I crave for them. But it's too bad I have to drive a long way for them. Don't think this is a fast food restaurant because they make the food when you call to order it! This is mostly a carryout restaurant , so you really wouldn't be able to sit and eat there. Eggrolls, fried rice, chicken wings... yummy! The family who runs it is very friendly and prompt.

A co-worker recommended AP-DeliUnfamiliar with the area, I decided this would be a nice little adventure. So from school, I ventured south along Martin Luther King Dr until 107th and made a left onto Michigan Ave. The area seems like it use to be very popular, but I guess due to the economy, one of the only places surviving in the area is AP Deli. So the area isn't that scary; i did see the CPD cameras in the residential area. As i walked in, I realized this place is very old and has been around here for a pretty long time. The staff pleasantly greeted me behind the bulletproof glass. I ordered the main menu item; corned beef. Picked up my order and noticed how they have drinks i never seen before or drinks I haven't seen for a long time; Arizona drinks I never knew existed and Wildwood canned soda.I quickly got into my car and drove back to school, because it's a take-out only place. The corned beef sandwich is pretty good. It's finely cut and it's a decent portion. It has a nice tenderness and fattyness to it. I only wished I got fries with it and there are lots of little bits of corned beef everywhere. I just felt it was a little over-priced for just a sandwich ($7.45). Unless that is the norm, then I stand corrected.Until I can find a better place for corned beef in the southside, this will be my goto place.", "rating": "4", "date": [2011, 4, 6]}, "7": {"description": "A.P. Deli is the standard for which other places serving up corned beef sandwiches in Chicago are measured (at least on the southside...and if you haven't heard about this joint yet for you folks north and west--shame on you..listen up). A.P.'s been around for years, and they are quickly expanding. \u00a0In a city that holds hot dogs, pizza and steak near and dear to its heart, blowing up as a deli in Chicago is tough. \u00a0A.P. Deli aint never been scerd. \u00a0And they now have numerous locations to prove it.The secret (that's not so much a secret): a HUGE, thin sliced corned beef sandwich that's enough to feed two. The price is more than reasonable (roughly 7 dollars). It usually comes with a sliced pickle and hot peppers--that once stuck inside the sandwich set it off like Vivica (Foxx for you slow pokes...for you super slow folks, Vivica Foxx was a star in the movie Set it Off--thanks, you've now ruined the vibe)....back to it...A.P. Deli is such a gem, it was the inspiration for a deli my Dad opened up in the late 90's called 3 J's. He knew that A.P. was onto something and although he didn't fair as well with his business ventures, A.P. continues to thrive. It's actually a shocker nobody had reviewed the ORIGINAL A.P. Deli on 107th and Michigan until me, so I'm honored. (taking a bow)I first went to this spot in the mid 90's and back then the location on 107th & Michigan was a bit sketchy. Not sure how things are around there now. The good news is A.P.'s are popping up all over the place. So if you want to find out what (arguably) the best corned beef in Chicago tastes like, hit A.P., walk up to the counter and repeat after me:\"I'd like a corned beef on rye with mustard\" The hot peppers will come in a white wrapping. Stick those in your sandwich, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

However, I didn't even get my hair done and unfortunately had to walk out.Lauren and I scheduled a date and time to install Marley Twists on my hair. I also showed her photos for inspiration- as I didn't want them to be too big. She said it would be twenty dollars more. She then cancelled on my less than two hours away from the appointment but said she'd give me 10 dollars off. Today I went to the 5pm appointment we agreed on however when I got there she was in a middle of installing a weave. By the looks of it I knew it would take at least another hour. Lauren did not apologize for being behind schedule. In addition the salon is a zoo and not relaxing at all - extremely loud music to the point that you can't even hear the other person next to you speak and kids running around.At around 5:45pm when she was done with her client I got up to walk to her chair - she stopped me and said someone else is next. Again she did not apologize or offer any explanation. When I first walked in Lauren didn't say there was another person ahead of me. Never mind the fact that I texted her at 3:30 pm to confirm my appointment. Around 6:30pm she came over with her assistant to get started on my hair - finally! Then she stopped after about 8 twists and went back to the other client. When I inspected the twists that were done so far I was horrified - different sizes and lengths,the twists were not evenly twisted and it was clear that two different people were working on my hair. After waiting yet another half hour - around 7:30pm I told Lauren I wasn't happy with the size or look and I've been waiting for too long. Again no apology about having me wait for HOURS and nothing but excuses regarding the poor execution of the twists. Then she left me hanging and went back to another client. Finally I told her I couldn't wait anymore and will have to leave to which she did not respond. I'm not sure if she was overbooked or just started late that day but I would've preferred that she was realistic about when she could get to my hair instead of having me wait for THREE HOURS before I finally just left. Some stylists just want your money and don't care about customer service or satisfaction which ultimately brings in and keeps the clients.

There is NEVER A TIME YOU CAN JUST VISIT & RECEIVE a complete order of chicken. Mark my word there will be an issue with chicken supply & you will receive major attitude when you question it. On Tue, Oct. 27, 2015 at 8:15pm my children & I went to this Popeyes East on 103rd. There was along backed up line as usual, so once I did eventually get to the intercom. I placed my order & I had 2 coupons. 1 for a 8 piece mix/spicy & 3 piece tender mild. As I was speaking to the unprofessional young lady you can tell she had attitude and had a egde on her voice. She told me there was no WHITE MEAT. I said how long is the wait? She said 15-20 min. I said that is fine I will wait, I do not eat dark meat. So I paid for my orders & waited like 10 min. until I noticed my receipt said mild chicken. I drove back to the intercom to let her know make sure my chicken is spicy. She stated we don't have any spicy chicken, I said what have I been waiting for then? You told me you were cooking white chicken & it would be a 15min wait. She said MILD. I said I DO NOT WANT any MILD chicken, I want SPICY & I want to make sure my order will be correct. She said with a edge in her tone, \"YOU WANNA WAIT AGAIN\" I said i want my order CORRECT...She stated, well you gon have to wait another 20min. Mind you I had already waited 15 min. for a box of 8 piece. I said I been waiting this long I will wait, I want my order correct. With a attitude she sighed & said \"YOU CAN MOVE ON UP OUT THE DRIVE THRU\" , intsead of saying ma am will you pull to the side again????? I said EXCUSE me? What is your name? She said Madonna. IDK, something on that order.. And may I add this young lady was a MANAGER at this location. UNACCEPTABLE & POOR REPRESENTATION!!!!! So I calmly pulled to the side a second time & my kids & I, waited an additional 20 + minutes in my car out in the rain. My kids was in the car getting very restless, because it was late in the evening. So a fast visit to Popeye's turned into a 40 minute wait. I would of left but my family had their mouth set for popeyes. I sat watching at least 10 cars receive their orders, so now she is being vindictive. It is now 8:56 p.m. mind you I arrived at 8:15. She comes dragging out of the door with the bag & I asked her what is the district manager name she answered with a smart edge in her tone Symphony Redmond. \u00a0As her arrogant self walked away \u00a0she clapped her hands as if she was saying I don't give a care who you call. As I said she was being very vindictive, when I got home my chicken was warm/cool.NOT HOT..I live less than 3minutes away from this location. \u00a0Managers are suppose to lead by example. Not in this case, this girl was as cocky, arrogant & ignorant as they come. An \u00a0the behavior is UNACCEPTABLE especially for management.

I think it's like $27 for a pedi and you are in and out in about 1/2 hour. And that's for the spa pedicure too.

After coming up to my hour of wait time, a young lady came in, the gentleman at the door asked her what did she want done and she said a soak off and an overlay. She signed in and say next to me which was right next to the receptionist/ his station. He looked at her again and looked at the clipboard then days \"Oh Ashley, you don't want a pedicure, too?\"(so it was obvious that she was a regular for them). She said \"No, I'm just going to have these soaked off\". How about within 10 minutes of her waiting, he leans over and tell her to go sit a station and a man begun her service?!!?? WAIT A MINUTE, I'm not just seeing what I think I'm seeing just happen!!?? So I leaned and asked a young lady did she understand what happened. She said it looks like she's getting her nails done, I explained I've been waiting in the same service! She says \"oh girl, I thought you were waiting for eyebrows!?\". So I politely stand up to look at the clipboard and sure enough, a soak off and overlay for Ashley with Vu!!! NOT ONLY THAT, it's people marked off all around my name!!! I asked the man about it and he said \"oh, your still down, I'm right here then this person then you\". I ask why couldn't I go to who's available, I didn't write your name down?\".

They were hot from the deep frier, insanely soft & fluffy texture and the flavor was absolutely mouth watering. What was supposed to be one bite turned into us devouring an entire Texas glazed donut and a smaller chocolate donut between us. We were on our way to dinner, so that definitely wasn't the original plan. But it was just so good! We could not stop eating. At nearly the exact same moment we both exclaimed the donuts were like crack! We were addicted and had to force our hands to stop grabbing more so we'd actually have something left for breakfast the next morning.Old Fashioned Donuts are the best I've ever had for the light, fluffy, covered in glaze type of donuts. On top of being friggin amazing, their prices are extremely reasonable. A huge Texas sized donut which takes an entire To Go container is just $2.22 and you can get it in either plain glazed or chocolate. We got 2 Texas sized donuts & 3 normal sized donuts for under $8. Wowza! We went to Old Fashioned at about 515pm on a Saturday. They are open from 6 to 6 each day and when we went, we waited in line about 15 minutes. The place was packed and sadly they had a 35 minute wait for Apple Fritters so we passed on those. Something to look forward to the next time we go! The lady who took care of us was very friendly and quick in her service.A very cool little added bonus of Old Fashioned is that the front of the shop is all glass windows and you can see the donuts being made. I've just had my other donuts this morning and I have to say they are definitely better fresh from the deep fryer. But my pro tip is to microwave it for 20 seconds to get it back to as close as you'll get to the warm from the fryer gooey goodness.

But you will find some damn good donuts and one very orgasmic apple fritter...which I'll get to in a moment.

Seriously picture perfect, exactly what I wanted, couldn't have been better. Maybe one of my favorite parts of my wedding.However, my bouquet was all wrong. When we had our first meeting with The Blossom Boys, I brought in 6 pictures of bouquets I liked. 5 of the 6 were of tight, mounded style bouquets, and 1 was a looser garden-style. I explained, I wanted the mounded style, but I included the other picture because I liked it's colors. I said specifically I don't like bouquets with alot of green leafy filler in them. When we went back for our second meeting to hear their proposal, they had me down for a loose garden-style bouquet. I corrected them, and watched him make the change on the paper. Months later, when we made our final payment, I checked AGAIN that they had me down for a mounded-style bouquet; and they did. However, when the flowers showed up on the wedding day; my bouquet was in a loose garden style with all sorts of extra green buds shooting out of it. My dad and one of my bridesmaids spent a few minutes snipping all the green things off, and it helped ALOT but I still didn't really care for the overall look of it.Additionally, the shop could be very difficult to get a hold of at times. They also made a mistake and tried to double charge us the delivery fee. Also, our wedding was two weeks ago, we made the final payment two weeks before that, but TODAY they replied to a month old email asking when we could come by to drop off our last check. So many levels of not organized....Bottom Line: These guys will do amazing work for you, but you need to be prepared to stay on top of them and be CRYSTAL CLEAR with what you want from DAY ONE.

It's basically geared towards people getting the things they need such as toiletries for the house and food versus the Wal Mart store where you get anything and everything there. It's also situated in an area where it's needing accessable stores because not everyone owns a car and some are having to do their shopping trips on public transportation. I live about 10 minutes away from this store and it's convenient when I don't feel like shopping elsewhere and dealing with the crowds which is pretty common for Wal Mart. This location also has a pharmacy so you can get your prescriptions filled all while you do your shopping. As I was walking in two women in the parking lot sat around complaining about the store being there when I see it as it gives people a choice of where they want to shop. I shop at multiple stores for things one store may not have that one may have. I do have a problem with how they don't seem to have a policy in place enforce appearance nobody should be working where they have tattoos showing and one employee had teeth missing. As a working professional you would want to look your best when working and tattoos and missing teeth is hoodratish and just plain wrong. I do like how they provide a feedback box where if you want something in particular they will work to get it for you but they do stipulate that not all items may be available due items being seasonal, regulatory, and other restrictions. If you live within walking distance it's helpful because not everyone has cars to drive to Wal Mart and the closest one is in Evergreen Park for the south and southwest side of Chicago. Staff was friendly and working hard to accomodate the flow of customers that came through the doors. It was very organized and Chicago Police was present to ensure that public safety was an utmost priority. The store was clean and well stocked with mostly common items people buy from milk to toilet paper. Parking was not a problem and you could find a spot even though you had to walk a few steps.
