Friendly and helpful like their other locations. \u00a0Not too much new, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as I always spend way too much here. I need to stay focused and get the garbage can I need. This is a big store for the Roosevelt Collection and it will give some competition for Bed Bath & Beyond and Target.I ended up buying the trash can with the green stick, it was a reasonable priced 79$ compared to a Simple Human one of similar size, plus it's the exact one I have now. Since our neighborhood finally got recycling we need to separate the trash, so either two cans or a ridiculously priced Simple Human dual trash can 179$ with a tiny blue insert. If I go with that one I'd have to switch how I use the trash inserts. We recycle more than we have have of regular trash, I can also see guests throwing stuff in the wrong side. Modern day problems!They were well staffed, and for as busy as it was there weren't any lines. You can pull up to the front doors to load up, but you're warned to have someone stay with your car. I parked in one of the pay spots above ground and took the cart to the spot and back. I got lucky as the meter boxes were broken and security told me they'd be out for two hours.

My last visit was extremely stressful, as i could feel negative vibes from her, and it was similar during the previous visit....45 days earlier. So both times were unpleasant. When i asked her what was wrong, why she was stressed, she kept saying she was fine. She was coughing and her voice wasn't clear. i wanted to check if she was sick to protect myself, she flat out said \"NO, i am NOT sick. i am in PERFECT health\". She kept coughing over my face all the time, including during the shampooing. i thought \"okay, looks like she IS sick after all, and that i will be contaminated\". The visit was long, and When i briefly expressed my frustration with the fact that my stylist was taking out her bad mood on me, i got yelled at in a sort of a blow up / nervous breakdown where she said she was \"worried about\" (something that i won't disclose here). So i was right from the start that something was wrong. To be honest, i was shocked to find myself in this truly awkward, uncomfortable and unpleasant situation and have to endure 1 more hour of negative vibes there. i didn't say anything, and even though i empathize with her issue, it does NOT justify yelling at your customer and acting stressed out all the way TWICE in a row.

This is just entitled, spoiled behavior. When you are unable to deal with stress and work at the same time, you stay at home.

Because EWC recently opened, it's been offering free wax services and half off for a Brazilian for new clients, so I decided to give it a try and booked an appointment for a Brazilian.When I got there, I was greeted by two receptionists. The waiting area was clean and spacious. While I waited, one receptionist walked over and gave me information about EWC's waxing services and discount membership options.My wax artist came out to greet me and take me to the room. The room was clean, spacious, and well-lit. (I've been to a couple places that were literally rented rooms/closets in salons and thus not as aesthetically pleasing.) She was very nice, but I thought it was a bit odd that she stayed in the room while I undressed my bottom half. (Every other time I've gotten a wax, the wax specialist left the room, giving me time to \"freshen up\" and get comfortable.)She kept conversation going the entire time. She explained that EWC is known for its special wax (special color, hard wax, no cloth strips, etc.). She did a good job of applying pressure and making sure the process wasn't too painful. Towards the end, she extolled some of EWC's products and really encouraged me to purchase them. She took me back to the lobby/waiting area and showed the products to me. Considering the price of each product, I politely declined. She and the receptionist were very firm in scheduling another appointment within the next 4-6 weeks. The wax specialist left me alone with the receptionist so that I could schedule something; I tried to explain that I would call and schedule over the phone, but I couldn't get out of it. It's not that I mind scheduling in advance, as I often do with my regular waxer, but I wanted to be sure that the waxing was well done by checking \"growth\" over the next couple weeks. The receptionist also tried to encourage the discount membership option again, and I said I'd think about it--again, for the same reason of wanting to make sure over the next couple weeks that the waxing was done well.It's been a couple weeks since my waxing appointment, and \"growth\" has been good--no in-growns, irritation, etc. Also, hair growth seems to be a bit faster than when I get waxed with my usual wax specialist, but it's not that big of a difference. (Personal note: I don't really have a lot of growth down there, and I can go eight weeks between waxes. I also am not prone to in-growns, irritation, etc.--only got redness once when I first got waxed). I think my usual wax specialist is a lot more efficient and quick, though, so I'm not sure if I'll be switching right away. (However, they just opened a couple months ago, so I'm sure the specialists will get better with time.) EWC is convenient for people living in the South Loop, though, and since it is closer than my usual place, I wouldn't mind going here when I can't make it up to the suburbs. Also, the discount membership packages are actually pretty decent, and if you're a student, you can get a good discount as well.

I love the menu items, it tries to catch on to a modern twist of Mexican food but doesn't go too far. The steak fries is like a nacho grande just with fries instead of nachos. The tacos and tortas are also very simple. What I don't like too much is the steak, it almost tastes like roast beef and is too saucy and has a huge flavor kick that gets old after a while. The meat feels grainy, and personally I don't like the sauce.Service is ok, it takes a while to get your food; one time we waited 30 minutes for our food. I guess that could be good if the food tastes fresh, but it does taste frozen. The staff at the registers really don't act like they want to be there and are not too inviting. Well if the staff don't want to be there, why do I want to be there?There is a cool vibe and it is a fun spot. Every time I go there is different music playing. The first time I heard Salsa, the second time I heard Hip-Hop and the last time I heard top 40. Personally I didn't enjoy the music the last two times and so I chose to get the food to go. Other than music, Flacos Tacos has a Spanish decor that resembles the food they are trying to make.Overall, this is a good spot to go if your in the mood for Mexican flavors, and it is definitely good the first time, but the shotty service, inconsistent music, and long wait for food is enough to make me want to choose another spot, or get to-go.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 12, 16]}, "55": {"description": "It's fast and cheap to eat in the city and open late when out on the town.

The vibrant yellow and blue just makes you feel like you're in a fun place.The Yolk logo is so darn cute and the little fried egg inside the building is overly adorable. I just loved the color scheme here! It even goes all the way into the bathroom! There are a lot of people coming in and out and it's a little confusing as to what you're supposed to. You wait and then you will be seated shortly. The menu is filled with so many different things that it'll be so hard to choose which one to get. But when I saw the very berry french toast, I knew that it was calling for me.The portion sizes are big here and I barely even made a dent in mine. The french toast came with five pieces of half toast smothered in honey, yogurt, granola and berry explosion. There were blackberries, blueberries and strawberries everywhere. I think I made it through about 2.5 pieces of half slices before I caved in. The pieces of toast are buttered and so fluffy on the inside. They don't get soggy, which I love. The yogurt has a nice tartness that balances the sweetness from the honey and berries. Berries are really fresh and in season! I loved it berry much!My friend got the chicken and waffles and I was surprised by how big it was. The waffle is so fluffy and has pieces of bacon scattered throughout. The pieces of chicken are tender and perfectly crisp on the outside. I think it could have used a little bit more gravy, but it was decent enough to get through the entire dish. Who knew that chicken, gravy, waffles and syrup could make such an awesome combination?! My friend also ordered a side of potato hash which came out well seasoned and nicely cooked. Our server was friendly and did check up on us here and there. Our water was refilled promptly. We were just slightly confused as to how we pay since many people were coming up to the register (you can order takeout which a lot of people do). The server will bring you your check which you then bring up to the register to pay. Most of the dishes here range from $10-15 depending on what you get. The portion size is very generous, I could have definitely shared.Overall, it's a perfect little brunch place.

My first day I selected the Tour de France from the sweet side of the menu. It was three different varieties of their French Toast including banana with peanut butter, orange bread with strawberries and lemon poppy seed with blueberries. I enjoyed all three but the poppy seed was my favorite. Day two I flipped to the savory side of their menu and chose a hearty Santa Fe frittata. It turned out to be huge and I was unable to polish it off. I enjoyed this dish as well with a good bit of spiciness to it. The last day I went old school and just picked their scrambled eggs with bacon and wheat toast. This dish too was yummy and well prepared. The eggs weren't to dry or runny but just right. They have a nice variety of juices to pair up with your breakfast. I stuck with OJ but one time I got a strawberry OJ mix that was a nice change. Their bacon is thick and meaty and not cooked too crisp just the way I prefer. Plenty of tables and booths to seat everyone are available without a wait during the week at least.

Also, it was ridiculously packed during my visit. Wait time was an hour! As I said earlier, that menu is rather extensive and there is something for everyone. For those with a sweet tooth, Yolk offers a variety of pancakes, waffles, crepes, and french toasts. Luckily for me, they focus more on savory items such as omelets, benedicts, scramblers, skillets, and a myriad of specialty options. I opted for a scrambler with a side of fresh fruit and an english muffin. (yelp.com/biz_photos/yolk\u2026). Mine had turkey sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. I really appreciate that they will use egg substitute upon request without any additional charge. It was just ok but the turkey sausage seemed like some generic jimmy dean breakfast item. I also had a bite of Christina C's Irish Bennedict (yelp.com/biz_photos/yolk\u2026). It had corned beef hash and roasted tomatoes. Not bad at all. I enjoyed it more than my own order. My other friend ordered a skillet. Normally, this guy can pack away food but he barely got through half of the order. That skillet was so heavy that he couldn't even look at the side of pancakes...that poor soul haha. Be prepared to share if you decide to go this route. Fresh strawberry orange juice was a hit with us! Definitely check that out. I think my favorite part of this restaurant was the location.

It's a nice touch.However, once we got our server, I actually don't think we saw her again until we had to flag her down furiously to get the checks. Girl, come check on us a little.Truly, the food is meh. I got the croque vegetable, and had to douse it in mayo, Dijon mustard (which it already had on it), and hot sauce to actually taste anything.

Food was delicious. And when I say delicious, mouth is watering just thinking about my sunny side up eggs and sausages. Anywho, I was seated next to the big wall near the bar. My purse was hanging on the back of my chair NEXT to the wall. I NEVER got up, once. Our waiter seemed pretty cool, at some point he ended up leaving during our meal because it was the end of his shift. I had taken my ID out of my wallet (in my purse) for our mimosa brunch and was putting it back in after maybe 45min/an hour? In this time period, I never got up from my chair. I went to put my ID back in my wallet and my wallet was gone. I initially was in disbelief because something like that has not ever happened to me, so it was a bit shocking.I decided to be mature and understanding and calmly asked the waiters if they had found a wallet, they said no. Then I decided ok I guess it was stolen. I told them that my wallet had been stolen but didn't understand how because I had never gotten up from my chair and I was sitting a considerably far distance from other people. The only people who came by my table and me were the bus boys who put down our plates and picked them back up and our two waiters. They immediately asked me if I was sure that I didn't get up from my chair. Then proceeded to ask me if I even brought my wallet..at this point my sister was furious that they tried to make me look like a fool. Once we realized it could have been someone apart of the restaurant staff, we told them. The managers both vouched for the waiter, stating he'd been here for three years and he didn't need to steal. I don't know what that means, but ok. They kept lying for the waiter and said he was in the back doing some things, but when my sister kept insisting on speaking to him, he had miraculously left (a while ago). At the end of it all, I had cancelled all my credit cards and had no money whatsoever with me. This was a Saturday and the banks had just closed an hour prior. You would think they would comp my meal, but they sent me my check with no apologies or anything. It disappoints me to have to write this, because the food was amazing. But the way everything was handled was very irresponsible and I'm sure the restaurant owners wouldn't want any customer to feel the way we did: dissatisfied and disappointed. At the end of the day, the customer is the most important person. The least they could have done is comp-ed my meal.

I made an appointment for 5:30pm a little over a year ago (yeah, it's been that long - I'm looking for some closure here). I was coming straight from work and arrived at 5:32pm. My stylist, I can't remember his name - something like Keith, looked at the clock as I gave my name and he said he'd been waiting for me. Okay. Sorry dude, I rushed here from work so you can chill out and I'll give you two of my minutes some time to make up for the couple you lost. So this man, I will call him Keith, takes me to the back and we get started. I'm a pretty simple girl on the outside and I am that way intentionally. Like a lot of people, I've got anxiety about talking to strangers and being the center of attention and change and blah, blah. It's written all over me. When I answered \"Suave or something. I don't really know\" after Keith asked me what kind of shampoo I used, he should have changed his whole game plan. I'm at the [bleeping] hair cuttery, I'm not here to buy a new product. Keith was offended with my answer, \"Girl, You're in CHICAGO! You should know what shampoo you're using.\" I don't think my location has anything to do with how necessary it is that I am aware of the brand of shampoo I use. But then again, I'm not a professional stylist so what do I know? At this point, I knew Keith and I were not going to have a lasting relationship, but when we started small-taking I found out he has familial ties to the city where I went to college. I grew up and went to college in Pennsylvania and am a real sucker for \"it's a small world after all\" coincidences so I thought maybe the rocky start Keith and I have had could be salvaged. I tried to listen with an open mind when he was telling me about the superior product he was using to wash my hair. When the cut started, I told him I just wanted a trim. I didn't even tell him to give me layers. Just a trim. I knew not to give him any leeway. He, again, seemed offended. And I again, thought, \"I'm at the [bleeping] hair cuttery. Just cut my hair and let me leave satisfied.\" He held up my long-ish hair and tried to sell me highlights. Highlights! What in the world made him think that I'd be interested in highlights is beyond me. I tell him no, I'm not really one for highlights. Again, offended. He then said, in a tone that I didn't take as playful, \"What made you so... blah?\" I joked and offered, \"That'd take more time than we have right now to explain\" and we both laughed, but this time I was the one who was offended. Someone who I am paying to give me some vanity should not be diminishing my confidence and I thought Keith was very unprofessional and judgmental in this manner. \u00a0From there the cut continued, and it continued, and it continued. To be honest, I wasn't paying much attention to the actual cutting as it was happening, I was more focused on how this man could be so demeaning and wondered if he was like this in all areas of his life. When he took off the apron and held the mirror up for the symbolic revealing, I nearly cried. Not only was the cut really, really bad, it validated the sheer misery I was feeling. I still paid Keith, something I regret to this day, and I even took his business card. I was pleasant and nodded when I looked through the mirrors, but man, I should not have been so polite. I was going out that night and I thought about bailing. I promise you, I'm really not one to overreact, contrary to this review. I've never had a haircut bad enough to affect me other than how I brush or style it or the amount of shampoo I have to use. All in all, Keith cut about four inches off. Not quite a trim, but it's normal for a stylist to cut more than you ask for. I could have dealt with the length if the cut had any style to it at all, but it didn't. I looked like a four year old who cut their own hair.No one made mention of my disastrous haircut, probably because they didn't want to talk about the mess that must have been made to make such a mess. After writing this review, it seems like I'm reviewing Keith \u00a0more than the hair cuttery. The establishment was pretty bland and forgettable itself, everyone knows what a hair cuttery looks like. I did find myself wishing I had a different stylist because at least their customers were smiling sitting below them. I was not. I'll never go back to a hair cuttery because of this experience. I had a fine hair cut at a different location about a year before this one, but I won't give the company another chance. I will also never go somewhere to get my hair cut because it's cheap.

The first time I went the cost for mid back Senegalese twists was $200 in September or October of 2013. The cost for the same hair-do in February 2014 is $250 which is now really out of my price range. I understand that prices have to increase for inflation but a $50 increase is ridiculous. Now I don't have a lot of experience with getting my hair braided/twisted \u00a0and so I went with Glo On because they had really good reviews. Everyone seems to have an opinion of what makes a hair braider good and all I knew was that this place had good reviews and they weren't too difficult to get to. Something else that bugged me besides the price was willing to write off is the experience. When you have someone sitting in a chair for up to 6 hours and the client is paying you a lot of money I think it is courteous to offer them refreshments such as water and it also can't hurt to apologize if you are delayed by something.The last time I went I think that my spot was overbooked because at one point there were 3 people at once waiting to have there hair done including myself (though she did have an assistant). At some times I was left sitting waiting for long periods of time because she was working on other people. Shavon started doing my hair at 9:30 but I didn't get out of her office until 6pm.

Not in the sense that I wanted a new place to go, but in the sense that this section of Clark is going through a rebirth. Places like First Draft, the new condos, and now Villains will hopefully bring this section of Printers Row up to the standard that exists two streets over on Dearborn. I'd comment on Blackies as a contributor, but that's just hopeless. I was a bit disappointed in my first visit. First, the menu is highly complicated for the customers in this neighborhood. I get that they are trying to be \"organic,\" \"local,\" \"authentic midwestern,\" etc, but come on, when the cheese plate and the burger are the only things recognizable on the menu, there is a problem. \u00a0My wife order the cheese plate since she wasn't feeling the burger but nobody seemed to really know what the cheeses were. Their response was \"this is an international one.\" The Fromage Gods are shuttering! While my burger was good, it wasn't great considering the price point. Yeah yeah, I get that it that the burgers are hand made, but I'm not paying that much for bacon cheese burger. I will say the beer menu was extensive, although somewhat unrecognizable. Across the street at First Draft you find 60+ taps of names you know and love. The same thing is true for Bar Louie, Kaseys, Hackneys, and even Flacos. At Villains, it's a crap shoot. You order one and hopefully it meets your expectations. However, again, like the burger, the prices were high. Well, according to the management, not high enough since they crossed out the old prices and hand wrote in higher ones in pen (note my photo of the beer menu with the magically changed prices). \u00a0 The service was spotty at best, which is shocking since they don't really seem busy. I get that they just opened, but when the staff gloats that they \"worked at the old Villains\" and have a \"fantastic chef\" there is a certain expectation of competency that they failed to exhibit. Don't hype yourself up until you're ready! This is a tough f&b town and many of us despise arrogance in our dining and drinking experience. Take the humble road and you'll be successful.

Yeah yeah, I get that it that the burgers are hand made, but I'm not paying that much for bacon cheese burger. I will say the beer menu was extensive, although somewhat unrecognizable. Across the street at First Draft you find 60+ taps of names you know and love. The same thing is true for Bar Louie, Kaseys, Hackneys, and even Flacos. At Villains, it's a crap shoot. You order one and hopefully it meets your expectations. However, again, like the burger, the prices were high. Well, according to the management, not high enough since they crossed out the old prices and hand wrote in higher ones in pen (note my photo of the beer menu with the magically changed prices). \u00a0 The service was spotty at best, which is shocking since they don't really seem busy. I get that they just opened, but when the staff gloats that they \"worked at the old Villains\" and have a \"fantastic chef\" there is a certain expectation of competency that they failed to exhibit. Don't hype yourself up until you're ready! This is a tough f&b town and many of us despise arrogance in our dining and drinking experience. Take the humble road and you'll be successful. Finally, I wish Villains good luck.

The main problem were the prices and the variety. I think they could use a few more reasonably priced items: throw some Pom frites on there - everybody eats them and all the farms have potatoes. I get it, there's a fancy demographic moving to the area, but until the area develops more, I think the menu could be a bit more accessible. It's not outrageous, just slightly overpriced I.

I was completely in shock and almost thought it was something I did wrong...until I read Kevin's review and saw that it was almost the exact same review.This manager or owner, whoever he is, is a very rude and unprofessional person.

We obliged. We understood that all members needed to be with us, but asked if there were any accommodations that could be made. The OWNER, came back and told us that he could accommodate ten people, but reiterated that the other two people, upon arrival would not be able to sit with us. Which we understood. However, this point he presumed was not clear because he re-stated it another two times, with the unnecessary presumption that we would proceed to \"get in his face\" if they were to arrive and not be seated with us, this which he based on his \"30 years of restaurant experience.\" Each member of our party assured him that that would be fine. As we waited, the hostess assured us that the OWNER does not usually behave in this way and that he may have been overwhelmed. However it was 2pm on Christmas Eve and there were only a handful of customers. The OWNER, came back and angrily asked us where the \"other two members of our party were.\" At that point, having been harassed by the OWNER of the establishment, it was pretty clear to our large party that the OWNER did not want to accommodate a group of young professionals.

She's always been friendly and dynamic. Initially I went in for a Brazilian wax because of a groupon. I was so impressed with the service that I bought a package (her package prices really cannot be beat!)Now that I've purchased 3 packages and have been a client of hers for over a year, I must say the service seems to progressively gotten worse. The last three times I went there, it felt very rushed even though I have been on time and no other clients were waiting. I've had to pluck full patches of stray hair (OUCH!). It seems like she's trying to take off way too big patches of hair at once which is not only extremely painful, but it also leaves behind hair and wax. I was willing to keep with her and continue using her services seeing if things would improve, just because Missy really is so sweet and really seems to care about her clients. But this last visit sort of put the nail in the coffin for me. I've had a landing strip for the past four months and it seems like she forgot and just slathered the wax right on it. I tried telling her but it was already too late. She tried fixing it but it ended up too thin, off center, and crooked, so i just shaved the whole thing off after over a year of healthy skin down there from no shaving :-(.I tip every time (20% of her full price) so I really have no idea why things have gotten worse over time.

In my experience, this is something that's done for free, although I'd be willing to pay if necessary.Dude working was almost standoffish when I asked him if he thought it could be an issue of the BB getting wonky or cranks coming undone, with wonderful phrases like \"Well, I can't say b/c I don't know the bike's entire history,\" or \"I mean, I'm *just* speculating here, so I'm really not sure.\" I asked questions of him b/c he's the expert, and every.single.answer I got was chilly, at best. It's just odd to me, b/c I have NEVER experienced this from any of the other 6-8 bike shops I've regularly gone to in my 8 years of living in Chicago. The guy's final suggestion was, if I wanted him to, he could remove the entire BB and crankset, check its tightness and threading, and completely reinstall it.I came in asking him to check the tighness of the crank arm, and he responded by suggesting we totally rip out and reinstall the BB and crankset. That's like going in to check the pressure of the tires in your car, and having the mechanic suggest you buy new tires b/c the pressure is low.That and, $9 inner tubes.

Explanation: I chose this place based on the excellent reviews, but I got my hair cut here today and my experience was sub-par. There were two issues with my cut and color, A) a miscommunication about what I wanted and B) how it was handled.I came in and asked for an ombre that could be added to my existing dark roots and reddish colored hair (my hair is dark brown). Ahmed told me that what I wanted couldn't be done. He spent 10 minutes talking about a different way to do the ombre that I didn't really understand, and I asked for clarification. He said that he would add color to the bottom of my hair, I said fine.An hour and a half later, he was finally done applying the color. He washed it out and when I looked in the mirror I saw that my hair was BLONDE. My hair is very dark and this was NOT what we had agreed to. I was upset because it looked terrible. I said \"This is a lot blonder than I was expecting.\" Ahmed immediately became very defensive and said \"You think this is the end of what it looks like? This is only part one of the process, I told you that.\" No, no he had NOT explained that it was a two step dye process and that it would take upwards of THREE hours to dye. I explained that I had not understood that, as I had never had an ombre take longer than 2 hours before, or take more than one dye, or use BLEACH on my hair. I have had ombre done every 6 months for the last 5 years at many, many places. He said that every other stylist I've ever gone to had done it wrong, and you have to bleach hair first to \"lift\" the color, and then tone it to the correct color. He lectured me about \"lifting\" and \"bleaching,\" how he had told me that this was going to be the process, and that everyone else had done it wrong for at least 10 more minutes. I explained that I had not understood this, and did not know it was going to take 3 hours to complete, so I had to reschedule an appointment I had that was coming up in 30 min. Ahmed then let me pick out the color to tone my hair, and had another woman in the salon wash it out. While she was washing my hair she said \"I heard you were freaking out about your hair being blonde\" in a very judgmental tone. Ok, I misunderstood about the process of the dyeing - I accept some blame for that. But to tell the client to her FACE that in effect you had been gossiping about her behind her back and laughing about her freaking out for something she didn't understand? It was incredibly rude and it made me even more upset.THEN I sat down in the chair for Ahmed to cut my hair and he asked what I did for a living. I told him and he said \"So what would you do if I came to you in your industry and told you that everything you were doing was wrong?\" Now this made me SO mad because he was insinuating that I said \"This is wrong, you are doing this incorrectly.\" ALL I said was \"this is more blonde than I expected.\" So he was basically accusing me of accusing him which is NOT what happened. I felt very attacked. I explained that the issue was that I misunderstood, and that I never accused him of being wrong or doing it incorrectly. The problem was just that neither the process nor the time investment were explained to me.Ahmed did give me $30 off and try to give me free shampoo, but these things were way too little too late. Again, the issue wasn't with the hair because it turned out not blonde (although the technique was not great, because the dye is streaky and poorly blended in many places). The issue was with the way he handled it. If he had simply said \"I'm sorry I didn't explain what what happening, this is what we're going to do\" I would have been totally fine. Instead, he got very defensive and attacked me and was very rude. I'm glad that so many other people have had good experiences here, but I was treated terribly and would not sink FOUR TOTAL HOURS into a haircut again, even if it were great (which it wasn't).", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 11, 20]}, "25": {"description": "This place is amazing!

Feeling a little adventurous, I thought I'd try First Draft pizza seeing as it got some other positive reviews here. I ordered pickup and my pizza was ready in 30 minutes, awesome! Brought it home and opened it up, not really what I was expecting, but what matters is how it tastes. The best way to describe this pizza is an identity crisis. I ordered it with boar sausage and sopressata (dry cured salami). These toppings are something that I'd expect from a Neapolitan brick oven style. They have some pretty bold flavors that are enjoyable, perhaps better off the pizza. I have no other way to describe the crust, but reminiscent of Little Caesars, although made in-house. The sauce is pretty bland; it's mostly dry tomato paste with some seasoning. The cheese was undercooked. When all of the above is combined, it just simply did not work. Pizza aside, First Draft is a really enjoyable down-to-earth spot with a great beer selection and friendly staff. It is definitely the type of neighborhood bar that you'd take your friends when you're not sure where to watch a game or grab some brews.

Yeah, definitely. (Though I just wish they had opened before I moved out of the dorm across the street, but alas. I'm sure my wallet's thankful that they didn't.)They have a truly mind boggling amount of draft beer on their menu in a wide variety of styles and will even mix beers for you (which I definitely recommend in some cases. They don't have Lagunitas's cappucino stout right now, but when they did, mixing it with a vanilla porter was my go-to if I didn't want to try something new).

I had some extra time before class started so I decided to check out the old store and reminisce. Bad idea. I ordered a Grande Soy Chai Tea Misto. My drink isn't that hard but I understand that it can be confused with a Chai tea latte. I said something when the Barista started putting in the Chai syrup instead of the tea bags. He apologized and told the other guy to ring me up while he made my correct drink. The guy that was ringing me up had the worst attitude. I'm almost positive he was high because the guy had to tell him several times what the drink was and he would just stare. I could tell he was having trouble figuring out what buttons to push so I said \"it's a chai tea add soy\". He gave me the look of death. Like \"god forbid I tell him what to do.\" I handed him my card and when he gave it back to me, he threw it on the counter and walked away. ARE YOU SERIOUS!?

However, if you do happen to stumble upon the originator, you're treated to some of the greatest fried chicken that walked the G's green earth.Chicago's finest, or at least most-well known, Harold's Chicken Shack, has been far more prolific than Frenchy's, but perhaps it falls under the same purview. I'm not even sure where the original Harold's sits, but it's most assuredly not this South Loop location (one of two in the Sloop, in fact).As such, the fried chicken at Harold's on Wabash is decidedly average. The chicken, particularly the thigh, runs on the small side, and the crisp decidedly lacks flavor. A chicken dinner comes standard with fries, seasoned decently, and a very delicious hot sauce. If taking to go, hot sauce is most definitely recommended on the side, as it quickly permeates the chicken skin and will render it soggy. A small side of cole slaw and some white bread recalls a fun visit to Raising Cane's.All in all, I just really miss Frenchy's.

Therefore there was no reason why my order couldn't have been immediately taken over the phone. Once i arrived to the resturant, the call was disconnected on the resturants side.

Conveniently located just about a block from the Roosevelt Red, Green, and Orange line station, it's a great central happy hour location. If you're driving, you'll have to park at least a block away, but it's kinda worth it. The space is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside and is not too small for a group. The staff is super friendly, the place is clean, with typical bar decor.The menu is reasonably priced and accessible. They have a pretty good beer list, they have beer flights, and a full bar. I was very excited to try the burgers. They have beef, veggie, and turkey burgers which made me happy. They have some pre-designed burgers that are listed as beef but you can substitute with turkey or veggie burger patties. You can also build your own burger and they have some pretty good options. I chose a turkey burger with bacon, and was really happy to find that the burger was well seasoned and delicious and my bacon was crispy.

I went with the lamb burger (house made lamb sausage, manchego cheese, mint chimmichuri (yum!), spinach, tomato-onion salsa.

The Hot & Smokey was served exactly as I ordered it and was a massive undertaking. The main flavors ended up being the BBQ glaze and the cucumber-onion slaw. The slaw was piled on thick, burying the Tillamook cheddar (and its flavor, sadly). The burger overall wasn't hot as the name suggests, which was a little disappointing. The flavors were more underwhelming than I expected, especially with the lack of heat and lack of cheddar goodness. The truffle fries were seasoned perfectly - salty goodness that was definitely worth the extra $1. Unfortunately, a lot of my fries were overdone. And \u00a0I didn't order it, but $2 extra for sweet potato tots? Come on. It's cheaper to add chicken to a salad ($1). The salad was large, served with 2 small bowls of the chili-lime vinaigrette on the side. The dressing was flavorful, albeit a bit spicy (even for my dad who loves spice), beware!

A coworker and I got-in on the Saturday before the conference, and because it was such a nice day out, we decided to walk from our hotel and eat at wherever the 'wind took us'. \u00a0We arrived at Buddy Guy's. Food: After a horrific plane ride on our corporate plane, I needed a beer. I am not particularly a man who cares for the 'refined' beers, so I stuck with a classic Bud Light. It was ice cold; but I am partial to frosty mugs and disappointed that these were not available. No big deal though, as I typically view frosty mugs as a bonus, and not a necessity. Admittedly, I wasn't as hungry as much as I was craving some alcohol to take the edge off, so I stuck with a cup of their 'down-home' mac and cheese. My coworker grabbed some of their BBQ wings.I did not get to sample the wings, but my coworker lauded at how good they were. There was definitely a generous portion of wings, smothered in a thick BBQ sauce. They did look good. THe wings might have even been dusted with some sort of flour mixture to help the BBQ adhere better to the wings. I can't be sure on that though.My cup of mac and cheese was good. A little bit one-note, and a little bit under-seasoned; but I liked the overall flavor of it. The consistency was nice and creamy, so it definitely delivered. What did not deliver was the overwhelming smell of dirty dish water emanating from the ceramic cup my mac and cheese was in. \u00a0This was a major disappointment, but I decided to just finish my meal and be done with it. There wasn't dirty dish water in the bowl, it just had that after smell -- you know what I am talking about. Like it was was washed and sanitized, but the water might have been a little old -- then it dried and the lingering smell remained.Either way, it was unpleasant and disappointing.Food: 3 / 5 (4 / 5 minus 1 star or the odorous cup)Service: We received service from the bar tender who had a million other duties to attend to (cleaning glassware, tidying up the bar, attending to bar guests, etc.). Though her service was hurried and indifferent, it was prompt and efficient. For me, I like an experience with a lot more character, and somewhere where I can go an feel at home. The server/bar tender failed to deliver this.Service: 2 / 5Atmosphere: The atmosphere was alright. It definitely isn't my usual scene. Had there been music, it may have heightened the experience, but no one was playing mid day on that Saturday. \u00a0It seemed clean, but the smell of my cup seemed to indicate otherwise. I did not use the restrooms. Either way, I don't think this is my type of place.Atmosphere: 2 / 5Price: $4 for a cup of mac and cheese isn't bad, and had there been no issue with the dishware, I think it would have justified the price. I believe that the prices here reflected the quality of the product appropriately.Price: 3 / 5Final Thoughts: Through-and-through, for me, I think that Buddy Guy's is a pretty mediocre establishment.

The man asked me if I wanted the tomatoes heated or fresh and then he recommended that I try it with bacon. Bacon? Of course!

based on yelp reviews \u00a0(which is why I'm reviewing this now) and because it seemed like they had a good 'whole' approach that included physical therapy and massage along with adjustments. \u00a0I knew that I would need more than the average \"crack and go' since I had been experiencing lower back issues for quite some time, without too much success with other treatments.The staff was always very nice and accommodating throughout the months that i went to PBH, with the physical therapist truly being the best part of the three headed approach. \u00a0Massage was good, but it was a revolving door of staff, which wasn't the best thing when you're trying to build on the last session. \u00a0Starting over with someone new, especially some of the less experienced people right out of school was totally a waste of time. \u00a0There were a few therapists there however that made that 30 minutes of the visit worth it.One thing that was pretty annoying was having to actually tell the massage therapists what to do each and every time you had a massage. \u00a0There should have been more communication between the doctors and the massage therapists. \u00a0I understand how important feedback is, but I shouldn't be directing you at all in a place that prides itself on a complete 'treatment' - if i knew what to do, my pain would have been gone long ago.This part of my experience, just smelled like is was built for people to milk their insurance into paying for a massage that made them feel good, but not something that was actually part of a recovery program. \u00a0A couple therapists were really fantastic and knew what they were doing when it came to muscular structure and how it played a role in your ailment, the others were barely different than getting a massage school session at Cortiva for $40.Anyway, from the beginning, the doctor laid out a plan and assured me that there was no reason that she thought I wouldn't see relief if i committed to the schedule she laid out (which miraculously, lined right up with the exact amount my insurance would cover for 'one instance' of treatment).That's fine, all I'm looking for at this point is a solution. \u00a0So i committed, and three months later, I was not all that much different than when i walked in the door for the first time.That said, I get the fact that these people aren't going to be able to solve every problem, everyone has. \u00a0It's just the nature of what they do. \u00a0If you're arm is broken, no matter how much massage, PT and chiropractic 'adjustment' you get, you're arm is still going to be broken. \u00a0What bothered me most about this place, was that by the time we were coming to the end of my treatment plan, the input from the doctor was less and less frequent. \u00a0It was as if they could smell the well drying up. \u00a0To the point, where we actually scheduled and followed through with an MRI to get a closer look at my problem, that was met with indifference on the part of PBH. \u00a0When i came in for my last session, i had my adjustment, my massage, and that was it. \u00a0No exit consultation, no real suggestions on what next steps for me could be, seemingly, and truly, absolutely no concern for me and my recovery. \u00a0A very nice smile and see you later, but nothing that I expected. \u00a0After working with a small group of folks for that many months, seeing them 3 times a week, there was one massage therapist and one physical therapist that were great and seemed to have true concern about what i could do there, and outside of there, to help my situation. \u00a0Other than that, including the two main doctors, you're just a number...and that number coincides with what your insurance is willing to cough up for you.If you're looking for some sort of surface level massage/chiropractic type session, that is more relaxing than anything and your issue is slight or basic maintenance, this place is probably fine. \u00a0If your issue is a little deeper than something a basic massage can't clear up and you're looking for someone to really delve into your issue and spend time and effort trying to find a solution with you, you should probably look to someone that will actually spend the time to find a solution with you instead of just putting you into the same routine they put everyone else into, hoping it'll fix your issue.To PBH, if you can't fix someone's issue, it would be nice for you to put together some sort of exit consultation where you could outline some potential next pathways.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 7, 11]}, "17":

why I'm reviewing this now) and because it seemed like they had a good 'whole' approach that included physical therapy and massage along with adjustments. \u00a0I knew that I would need more than the average \"crack and go' since I had been experiencing lower back issues for quite some time, without too much success with other treatments.The staff was always very nice and accommodating throughout the months that i went to PBH, with the physical therapist truly being the best part of the three headed approach. \u00a0Massage was good, but it was a revolving door of staff, which wasn't the best thing when you're trying to build on the last session. \u00a0Starting over with someone new, especially some of the less experienced people right out of school was totally a waste of time. \u00a0There were a few therapists there however that made that 30 minutes of the visit worth it.One thing that was pretty annoying was having to actually tell the massage therapists what to do each and every time you had a massage. \u00a0There should have been more communication between the doctors and the massage therapists. \u00a0I understand how important feedback is, but I shouldn't be directing you at all in a place that prides itself on a complete 'treatment' - if i knew what to do, my pain would have been gone long ago.This part of my experience, just smelled like is was built for people to milk their insurance into paying for a massage that made them feel good, but not something that was actually part of a recovery program. \u00a0A couple therapists were really fantastic and knew what they were doing when it came to muscular structure and how it played a role in your ailment, the others were barely different than getting a massage school session at Cortiva for $40.Anyway, from the beginning, the doctor laid out a plan and assured me that there was no reason that she thought I wouldn't see relief if i committed to the schedule she laid out (which miraculously, lined right up with the exact amount my insurance would cover for 'one instance' of treatment).That's fine, all I'm looking for at this point is a solution. \u00a0So i committed, and three months later, I was not all that much different than when i walked in the door for the first time.That said, I get the fact that these people aren't going to be able to solve every problem, everyone has. \u00a0It's just the nature of what they do. \u00a0If you're arm is broken, no matter how much massage, PT and chiropractic 'adjustment' you get, you're arm is still going to be broken. \u00a0What bothered me most about this place, was that by the time we were coming to the end of my treatment plan, the input from the doctor was less and less frequent. \u00a0It was as if they could smell the well drying up. \u00a0To the point, where we actually scheduled and followed through with an MRI to get a closer look at my problem, that was met with indifference on the part of PBH. \u00a0When i came in for my last session, i had my adjustment, my massage, and that was it. \u00a0No exit consultation, no real suggestions on what next steps for me could be, seemingly, and truly, absolutely no concern for me and my recovery. \u00a0A very nice smile and see you later, but nothing that I expected. \u00a0After working with a small group of folks for that many months, seeing them 3 times a week, there was one massage therapist and one physical therapist that were great and seemed to have true concern about what i could do there, and outside of there, to help my situation. \u00a0Other than that, including the two main doctors, you're just a number...and that number coincides with what your insurance is willing to cough up for you.If you're looking for some sort of surface level massage/chiropractic type session, that is more relaxing than anything and your issue is slight or basic maintenance, this place is probably fine. \u00a0If your issue is a little deeper than something a basic massage can't clear up and you're looking for someone to really delve into your issue and spend time and effort trying to find a solution with you, you should probably look to someone that will actually spend the time to find a solution with you instead of just putting you into the same routine they put everyone else into, hoping it'll fix your issue.To PBH, if you can't fix someone's issue, it would be nice for you to put together some sort of exit consultation where you could outline some potential next pathways.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 7, 11]}, "15": {"description": "I got a few treatments

Today I got the combo Original Hot and Mango Habanero. I Original is always good with very nice flavor and non-palette destroying spice. The mango really tempers down the habanero and balances nicely without being too sweet, especially on the meat itself. If you try the sauce along as I did it will kind of throw you off. The nice young lady at the counter suggested the honey mustard dressing. The meal only comes with (1) sauce so I added that to the mix. Overall the wings were pretty good. They were cooked perfectly.

I had to physically try and remove the salt from the surface of each fry before eating. I could only have it through approximately half of the bag.

This business is on MICHIGAN avenue so I expected no less than at least a 4/5 star experience. We walked in, and did notice the \"please be quiet\" signs and asked to check in. The two front desk women were busy and asked us to sit down please. They said it rudely and abruptly. I don't care how busy you are or how stressed you feel, don't project onto me. We sat.

She said something I a foreign language to him so I have no idea if he knows he was getting a certain amount. I took the receipt and wrote his name and that it was his tip.

The mani was very nice too! She shaped my nails very nicely and the polish job was perfect. The only problem was that I hit my thumb nail on something at work and it chipped...which eventually led me to have to peel off the entire nail polish. Other than that, my nails still look very cute.The only drawback I have to this salon is that the nail spa area is small and have 3 pedi chairs but only 2 mani desks so they had to juggle using the area.

The sound carries back as the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling. You will appreciate it when others are quiet during your massage.2. Pay with cash - you get a discount!3. Wear loose fitting clothing and make sure that you have pants that's can be rolled up when you soak your feet.4. Be prepared for an unconventional massage. This is reflexology and is not the canned massage you'd receive at your neighborhood massage envy. There are communal rooms and your clothes stay on. Therapist will work your glutes and hips so don't be surprised when they touch areas that other masseurs tend to avoid. 5. The therapists dig deep! They will get to stress spots you didn't even know you had. Sometimes the women will even use their knees/elbows and crawl on your back to work out the tension. If it's too much, you can certainly ask them to ease up.This being said.. The results are incredible. I always feel so relaxed and loose.

The nail tech did not appreciate me sharing that piece of information with her. In the end, I walked away with an acceptable pedicure.The manicure, on the other hand, was not. The nail tech carried her attitude from the spa chair to the nail table. When I asked her why there were streaks through the polish, she said the top coat would fix it. It did not. She also tried to fix her shoddy work at the back of my nails leaving a considerable amount of my nail exposed. After the top coated of the first had, she asked me if each nail was ok. They were not, but I had no desire to sit across from her any longer. If I have to tell a nail tech if a nail looks good, you have more problems than I can help you with.End result.

The reviews were positive and so we thought we would give it a try especially with the yelp special going on. This business is on MICHIGAN avenue so I expected no less than at least a 4/5 star experience. We walked in, and did notice the \"please be quiet\" signs and asked to check in. The two front desk women were busy and asked us to sit down please. They said it rudely and abruptly. I don't care how busy you are or how stressed you feel, don't project onto me. We sat. A minute later we were told our voice were too loud and the spa needs quiet. okay. No problem.

It's dark and the ambiance is a solid attempt with the music in the background. Here is the problem: the whole place smelled like a cheap and dirty version of Panda Express. It's subtle but I was hoping for scents of lavender and other relaxing things. Nope. It smells like Chinese food. The air conditioning vents are also super loud and when they turn on they actually drown out the sound of the music. Oh and you know how they said please be quiet?

It was a violent and almost traumatic experience. Maybe i pissed him off in another life? I don't know. But it felt that way.

She said something I a foreign language to him so I have no idea if he knows he was getting a certain amount. I took the receipt and wrote his name and that it was his tip.

As soon as I walked in, the lady yelled to me from another side of the room, \"pick a color\", not \"hello, my name is __ and I will assist you today\", but \"pick a color\". I was thrown off by that. When I finally picked a color, that lady started speaking Chinese with another lady who works there. I am a foreigner myself, and I perfectly know how it makes others feel when you speak in different language in front of somebody, who has no idea how to speak in it. They made me feel so uncomfortable. I am not even talking how unprofessional that was.Then the second lady left and I stayed alone with the \"specialist\", who was trying to do her job as fast as she could. I got my manicure and pedicure done in 40 minutes!!! Usually, it takes nearly two hours to make it careful and neat, but that lady was rushing somewhere (no idea where, as there was no clients for all 40 minutes that I was there). All the base and some nail polish were put occasionally and unevenly (luckily, I chose clear nail polish). \u00a0When I went to pay for my service, I was not going to leave any tips as, I believe, this service did not deserve any.

By the time I had finished my lunch, the crowd had picked up considerably. After studying the menu, I decided to keep it simple with a brisket sandwich. I noticed that chips were on offer, but none of the sides appealed, so I stuck with the sandwich. The brisket itself was delicious- tender and not fatty/gristly in the least. The sauce was solid, though I would have liked to be able to customize my sandwich with other types of sauce, possibly via squeeze bottles of the stuff set out on counters. I don't know if this is how things are run at the other locations, but I did not seem to see any free-range sauces here - even hot sauce. I had never had brisket served on a pretzel bun before - methinks it might be BBQ with a hipster twist - but I found the quality of the bread fairly tasty, if unexpected. The service was efficient, and pleasant, getting me in and out in good time for the afternoon's slate of Lit Fest events.

But, Dr. Sarai is so awesome that I was able to overlook this and give them another try. I'm so glad I did - this time around, I was welcomed by different staff than last time and they were really friendly and knowledgeable. This time, they even had my insurance information set up before I got there as to not waste my time with that. Yes, it is a little pricey, but they have a great selection of stylish and trendy eyewear. I came in for contacts, but I have my eyes set on a lovely pair of Gucci eyeglasses that are to die for. Despite being an \"upscale\" eye place, the staff was really friendly and they even worked with me and my stingy HMO insurance so that I could get the most out of my insurance and pay the least possible out of pocket. I can certainly appreciate that!So onto the optometrist - the best part! Dr. Sarai is so completely thorough with the exam and always takes the time to answer any questions that you may have. He took the time to explain to me the different tests he was doing. After suffering with dry eyes for a long time and struggling with my contacts, Dr. Sarai was able to come up with a treatment for me and suggested contacts for me that I can actually wear now without the dry redness I was so used to. As others have mentioned, he remembers his patients and you never feel rushed during your appointment.A few other great things about Village Eye Care in the South Loop: (1) you can book your appointments online, as well as fill out your health and insurance information online so it cuts down on the time of filling out the paperwork at the office.

Overall I did like it. I knew it was overpriced, but I just told myself that my eyes were important and it was worth it. I even brought them more business when I referred my girlfriend, and she got an exam and a year of contacts.Well I recently scratched my cornea taking my contact out. It annoyed me for a week, and even though I could tell it was almost healed, I decided to set up an appointment. I called and explained and was told the cost would be anywhere from $50 - $250. I fought with myself over whether to go but finally decided that it would have to be near the bottom of the estimate considering it would be such a simple visit, and that it was worth $50 for peace of mind, knowing it would heal correctly. I got there, and explained to the doctor before I went into the examination room that I am currently unemployed, and that I know it isn't that big of a deal and that I couldn't afford to pay more than $60, and if it would be more than that, I would just go. She seemed to be very understanding, and said it wouldn't be a problem. 5 minutes later and we were done. She looked at my eye, confirmed a very small abrasion almost healed, and gave me a sample of antibiotic eye drops. I'm sure you can tell where this is going. Got to the front desk, and they gave me a bill for $140 for the 3-5 minute exam. I argued and they claimed that includes the follow up exam. I told them I don't want a follow up exam and to take half off the bill. They said that was impossible. So that's about it. They won't even check out a return customer's very small problem for a reasonable rate. Even if you explain to them you don't have the money to pay if it's over a certain amount.

But then it got worse. Then the 12th comes and I don't here from them. I call and they seem confused as to why I've been told they were coming in on the 12th. They look into it, and tell me that my frames aren't at the store yet, but they are in the lab. They apologize, say they'll leave a message for the lab and that they should be in soon.....they will call me. Monday I talked to a woman. She tells me she looked into it. They're in the lab, they should be in tomorrow. I call again on Tuesday. Nope no glasses. This time I'm told, they're in the lab and all they need to do is cut them. Should be fast no big deal. I'm also told that the lab they use is close by, and the glasses will be sent by messenger. Hopefully I can pick them up Weds. after work. So which day is it? Everyday they tell me the frames are in the lab and my lenses just need to be cut. Everyday they tell me the next day my frames will be in....and they never are. Weds: They call me and leave a message apologizing. Apparently there was a power outage at the lab today. My glasses haven't been finished and aren't in yet. Really? A power outage. Maybe there really was a power outage, but come on. Now I'm just getting annoyed.

The office emailed me a day or two later to tell me my contacts were ready to be picked up and they are a perfect fit.I want to add that some businesses treat you with less respect or try to upcharge you when you come in with a Groupon or a yelp deal.

They told me that the manager would send someone to bring me back $10 cash only for the lassi. When I asked Grub Hub about the delivery fee, they said the manager would not refund the $8. Grub Hub gave me a $5 credit which was nice. But what kind of sense does that make?!! They will bring me back my cash (which 30 minutes later they still have not) but they won't refund the delivery fee or bring what I ordered?!!

Chicago Curry House s one of the 'better' Chicago Indian places but the quality is not matching the price, and the sheer randomness of the spice levels in their food despite specific requests for \"mild\", and the management's nonchalance that this is a reasonable customer issue despite constructive feedback tells me that they have no interest in being a truly excellent top tier Indian restaurant. Management feedback response - \"This is Indian food, it's supposed to be spicy\" might be considered old school charming by some, but to this reviewer shows they just don't care about the customer and having some standardization of spice levels. Specifically some dishes are pretty tasty - butter chicken, tandoori prawns - but others like the palak paneer are just meh. Some nice vegetable options but as this review suggests already - don't be surprised if you order something traditionally not spicy come back hot tamale spicy (like tandoori vegetables). My advice - order \"As mild as possible\" with every order even if it is not a traditionally spicy and you will at least have a 75/25 chance of it being mild enough for someone who hasn't burned all of his/her taste buds with cayenne to not be sweating profusely to survive the experience.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 7, 4]}, "1": {"description": "Worst Indian food ever!!

The tactile experience of holding one of those new Penguin editions, a \"curated\" selection of books rather than a few suggestions generated by an algorithm, a staff member to recommend something if you can only buy one thing today but have your eye on three different titles, and yes, that wonderful paper and ink aroma. Plus, if you're like me and you sometimes drop your reading material while perusing it in the bathtub, you're only out $10, not $150+.Did I mention that Sandmeyer's is also convenient to public transit? It is! You can walk to this lovely building from the red, blue, brown, orange, and green lines, and if you don't mind a little walk, it's totally doable from the metra as well.In short, go to Sandmeyer's.

The guy in front of me had more smoothie leftover in the blender than could fit in his cup, so she asked if he had a minute to drink the rest and poured it in a [wheatgrass] shot glass (to be returned). I was totally blown away by this honesty system...you literally get all that you pay for! On my second visit, I was the only patron in the store.

On two of those occasions, his roommate, a fellow PT loudly said while talking to other PTs at the main PT desk that my PT was at home, \"hungover and too busy f***ing this girl\" to come in to work.

After rudely dismissing my saying it was now $350 \"as that was a holiday thing,\" I showed Angelo the target.com page and he said I'd need to go to Guest Services to have it price matched. Annoying, but not a huge deal I thought.I get down to Guest Services and the woman whose name I can't remember already seems in a bad mood (can't really blame her, probably as fun as the airline lost baggage counter). I tell her the story (phone in hand) and she has to look it up on an iPad to confirm. After waiting a few minutes, I am told this is a temporary price cut and therefore not eligible for price matching. My problem with this is, is it really \"price matching\" when it is your own website?! I understand different stores incur different costs in getting their products but c'mon, this is a major international retailer we're talking about. I ask if I can sit here and buy it online for in-store pickup at the online price. \"Yes but it could take up to one hour to process.\" At this point I was tired of trying incredibly hard to give Target my money and left. While the woman carefully set the console in a bin, she essentially took the extra game I intended to purchase and threw it over her shoulder into another bin.

A lot more.Target opens its first stores in the Pacific Northwest in 1988. After only a year it opened 30 stores in Kentucky Tennessee Georgia North Carolina South Carolina and Florida becoming a national retailer with stores from coast-to-coast. In 1993 target opens 11 stores in the Chicago metropolitan area in one day- the most store openings in any one city on the same day to date.How often do we go shopping at the grocery store? Some people go every day, others - every two or three days, and others - purchase once a week. I belong to those who purchase once a week. Agree, it's convenient. Naturally, I choose the big supermarket where you can buy everything you need and not anywhere else to go. The best supermarket for me is Target.As I mentioned before Target is famous for the wide range of products from toothpaste to bots and technology. Moreover, I really like how they set items. Met quite a distance between detergents and products, so choosing bread you do not smell anything like Tide or some powder. On the top shelf is mainly organically clean and fat-free product that encourages buyers to look first at the healthy food.Have you ever come to Target and there were no free carts? No, never, it shows the presence of fast attendants. The first thing I noticed when I walked into Target, apart from the crowds was the smiles of the staff. If you go to Target to buy the products do not advise you to wear a red shirt. Uniforms of every staff present the quality and reputation of the supermarket.Also, despite the fact that Target is always full of people and a lot of shelves with goods I never felt I do not have enough space. Bright lighting creates the appearance of a huge space. Furthermore, there is one of the most spread errors in supermarkets - a cash register. Suppose in a supermarket 10 banks, but only two works, one express and one for large trucks. To have to stand in line longer than you spent on food choices. In the Target not all the cash, the company's focus on the client and she knows what time they are many. Therefore, you will not encounter this problem. Target is in daily business. This company knows that the client is paramount and create all conditions to make each of our shopping trip a little easier and a little happier.The company does not run in the race among the other supermarkets. Target understands that the one with whom he competes is its customers. The aim is the client complained or tried remake something and get ahead of it - to improve service to facilitate the process of shopping and etc. Target collaborates with its clients and this quality of his highlights in this business.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 11, 11]}, "7": {"description": "It's fine.

We searched his car and etc with no luck and since we had a formal dinner to attend that evening we drove back to Target to get the missing razors.

And we kept replying \"no, it never made it in the bag\" then the incompetent rep went and got security to find these razors for us. So this piece of shit security guard with an attitude says that he replayed the video footage and that the clerk who checked us out put the razors in the bag and he called us \"LIARS\" and implied that we wanted to STEAL $30+ razors even though we come here all the time and ALWAYS spend over $200. My boyfriend made it very clear we were not leaving until they resolved this, so the security guard went back to go through the tapes again and said that he checked twice now and he knows for sure that we left with the store with razors and if we werent lying then must have been careless and dropped them.

After only a year it opened 30 stores in Kentucky Tennessee Georgia North Carolina South Carolina and Florida becoming a national retailer with stores from coast-to-coast. In 1993 target opens 11 stores in the Chicago metropolitan area in one day- the most store openings in any one city on the same day to date.How often do we go shopping at the grocery store? Some people go every day, others - every two or three days, and others - purchase once a week. I belong to those who purchase once a week. Agree, it's convenient. Naturally, I choose the big supermarket where you can buy everything you need and not anywhere else to go. The best supermarket for me is Target.As I mentioned before Target is famous for the wide range of products from toothpaste to bots and technology. Moreover, I really like how they set items. Met quite a distance between detergents and products, so choosing bread you do not smell anything like Tide or some powder. On the top shelf is mainly organically clean and fat-free product that encourages buyers to look first at the healthy food.Have you ever come to Target and there were no free carts? No, never, it shows the presence of fast attendants. The first thing I noticed when I walked into Target, apart from the crowds was the smiles of the staff. If you go to Target to buy the products do not advise you to wear a red shirt. Uniforms of every staff present the quality and reputation of the supermarket.Also, despite the fact that Target is always full of people and a lot of shelves with goods I never felt I do not have enough space. Bright lighting creates the appearance of a huge space. Furthermore, there is one of the most spread errors in supermarkets - a cash register. Suppose in a supermarket 10 banks, but only two works, one express and one for large trucks. To have to stand in line longer than you spent on food choices. In the Target not all the cash, the company's focus on the client and she knows what time they are many. Therefore, you will not encounter this problem. Target is in daily business. This company knows that the client is paramount and create all conditions to make each of our shopping trip a little easier and a little happier.The company does not run in the race among the other supermarkets. Target understands that the one with whom he competes is its customers. The aim is the client complained or tried remake something and get ahead of it - to improve service to facilitate the process of shopping and etc. Target collaborates with its clients and this quality of his highlights in this business.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 11, 11]}, "41": {"description": "This store only gets my business because its so close to my new apartment. the staff has the worst attitudes I have ever seen.

One of the workers was making a pizza as I waited and I saw her carefully cover the entire crust with cheese, all the way to outer edges. I expected the same for me... What I received was a pizza with not only less cheese than a standard Toppers pizza, but it only covered HALF of each slice. This had to be a sick joke, except it wasn't very funny.

LaSalle building and their guests.Stopped by for breakfast. \u00a0Fruit and yogurt bar, bagel bar, made to order omelet station, packed and ready to go meals, Ended up having a tradition breakfast. \u00a0Scrambled eggs (cracked right in front of me, pinch of course salt, cooked firm... perfection), and bacon, sausage links, sausage patty, and hash browns. \u00a0Nice that you can get it all A La Cart for less than $2 each.Today's breakfast special was banana bread French toast with Vermont maple syrup for only $3.99. \u00a0I only passed because I wasn't in the mood for sweet this morning.Lunch was the Hanger Steak sandwich. I went with the pretzel roll and provolone. \u00a0Steak was tender, and tasty. Sometimes I need to add something like A-1 but this was solid on its own. \u00a0With pretzel rolls you can sometimes get an overly tough or dry one that requires gallons of water to wash it down. \u00a0When you go this route you sometimes end up \"tearing\" off your bites. This sandwich was perfect. \u00a0Held together and didn't fall apart yet easy enough to eat and wasn't tough at all. \u00a0Bonus points for not cooking it well done.Additional items tried-Pizza 4 out of 5 stars- Sausasge was pretty good as it was a little spicey. My co-workers and I were suprised this cooks in only 4 minutes yet comes out plenty crispy. \u00a0Pretty much everyone plans on getting the pizza again. \u00a0 \u00a0***** Thai Chicken Pizza special 5 out of 5. \u00a0If it wasn't for the sample I may not have thought \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0twice about this option. \u00a0The peanut sauce offered a rich flavor and the spice clinched in. The \u00a0 \u00a0 large portion of fresh veggies (carrot, cucumber, green onion) was impressive for something that costs less than $6. \u00a0I would have taken pictures of it but was handing out samples before I got back to my desk :)Taco Pizza - 4.5 out of 5. Refried beans, choice of fresh tomato salsa or roasted green salsa. \u00a0I had both and the green had a nice light kick and lots of extra flavor. \u00a0Green is the way to go here. \u00a0Cheddar cheese and ground beef. \u00a0Then out of the oven finished with queso fresco and cilantro. \u00a0 \u00a0It would have been a 5 for me if it had black olives. \u00a0Worth a repeat visit for sure.-Buffalo Chicken Wrap 3 out of 5 stars - Maybe 4. This think was delicious and loaded with chicken. \u00a0It's just I wish it was freshly fried chicken then diced, sauced, and served. \u00a0I realized that would take more time but with how good this tasted with the breaded chicken being soft, I can imagine it would be a 5 out of 5 with freshly cooked chicken.-Meatball sandwich 4 out of 5 stars - 3 nice size meatballs with proper amounts of seasoning. I hate it when a meatball is JUST a ball of meat. \u00a0These had plenty of seasoning and the sauce that it was tossed in was full of flavor as well. Visable chunks of olive, garlic, and capers.-Roast Beef and Swiss sandwich 4 out of 5 stars - This had to be at least 1/4lb of roast beef. Nice size sandwich and a nice assortment of ripe veggies to choose from as toppings. \u00a0I went basic lettuce, tomato, onion with the horseradish sauce. $1 more added a nice large side of fresh fruit.-Gryos Pizza (daily special) 4 out of 5 stars. - I was brave here. \u00a0I love gyros, one of my favorite foods, but as a pizza? \u00a0Cheese pizza made with seasoned lamb topping and onions. After it comes out of the oven it was dressed with the Cucumbers and Tomatoes and Tzatziki sauce. Nice melody of flavors but the tomato sauce overpowered the fresh veggies a little bit. \u00a0Not bad but I might as for less sauce or olive oil brushed on instead next time. That and likely ask to pay for extra meat. \u00a0-Burger, 3 out of 5 - \u00a0I think the other reviews are being a bit harsh. The taste of the burger was good but yes, it shrinks too much. They are hand formed but after cooking they shrink together making a thick patty that doesn't even cover the bun fully.**Update. 4 out of 5 but ask to have the beef patty flattened so it's thinner and fills out the bun**-Sweet BBQ Chicken Quesadilla. 2 ouf of 5 stars - Sweet is correct, no real spice hear. \u00a0Was hoping for a more falvorful chicken, like blackened or marinated. \u00a0Appeard to just be diced grilled chicken. \u00a0Very messy once the sauce was added. \u00a0A fork and knife meal. \u00a0It won't hold together eating it with your hands.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 6, 17]}, "2": {"description": "Absolutely Horrible!!!!

The hairdresser, I believe her name was Allison, seemed inexperienced, and although she did manage to get rid of my dead ends, did not adjust the style to what she cut off. The cut was very awkward as it didn't shape my face nicely, and it laid thick and dumpy on my shoulders (I have shoulder lengthed hair). She left it untextured and it looked very unstylish which I found ironic to the edginess of the salon they seem to boast on both their decor and advertising. I paid and left, but felt very uncomfortable about the cut, and so went back to get an adjustment. Luckily, the original hairdresser was unavailable and another lady who seemed to be more aesthetically inclined was able to help. She agreed that it needed more texture but even after she texturized it, it didn't look great. She too seemed to have a hard time understanding how to make shoulder- lengthed hair lie nicely with some layers and texture to frame a face nicely. I had a hard time communicating with both hairdressers, as they looked at me blankly when I told them exactly what I wanted.

After about seven great cuts in a row, I got a mediocre one--hey, it happens--but shortly after I left the shop the stylist started stalking me on a location-based dating app. Creepy! Then for my latest cut, just moments ago, the stylist basically clipped the sides and announced she was done. This, despite me asking her, \"Can you shorten it up on the sides and then notch it out on the top so I can wear it messy?\" When she didn't do that, and after I told her I that I still needed some taken of the top, she rolled her eyes and cut some off the back. Then when I told her more all over and shorter on the front, she said she didn't understand. So I explained to her how I do my hair again, and she goes, \"That makes no sense.\" When I explained again, telling her how other stylists handle it, she said, \"I'm sorry, but I don't know that technique. And you don't want me practicing on you!\" I told her I didn't know how else to explain. So I tried one last time to tell her what other stylists do. She laughed and said, \"You make absolutely no sense. I have no idea what you are even talking about.\" So I asked her if she had a book that showed styles. Based on her response, you would think I was in a fancy restaurant asking for ketchup. After reacting like she wanted to strangle me and telling me that they didn't have any style books, I suggested, \"Well, maybe I can get my phone and pull up a picture.\" She then said, \"No, I'll just chunk some out.\" I said, \"Yep -- that's basically what I was asking for.\" She then said, \"It is called NOTCHING. I will notch your hair.\" So I politely responded, \"Yeah. That's what I said. I asked if you could notch it out.\" She then replied, \"It sounded like you said knotting. That you wanted me to knot your hair into chunks or something.\"Okay, lady. First time ever I have had a stylist not catch on to what I wanted, especially because my hair was kind of already the way I wear it, just a bit grown out. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Regardless, she doesn't know how to notch hair out, or, evidently, use her context clues. So here I sit, recommending that you avoid \"Cassandra\" if you don't want to chance a weird, tense experience that leads to a bad haircut.And I'd tell you the name of the stylist that was following me on social media, but I'm worried she'll start creeping on me again.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 2, 1]}, "18": {"description": "Just received incredibly terrible service and a haircut I could've gotten from Great Clips for $8; or done myself for free.I have been going to Floyd's for years, garnering mixed feelings. Sometimes the cut is good, sometimes its no so great. Sometimes the service is alright, sometimes it sucks. This was my last visit.I don't remember the stylist's name (probably because she rushed through my haircut and was done in record time) or else I would post. I was greeted with an almost look of disgust on her face. She sat me down, wasn't pleasant, and asked what I wanted. I told her I was literally just in Floyd's about 2 weeks ago and decided I wanted it a little shorter. There was no offer to do the cut at a discounted price or even for free. (I wasn't expecting this, but considering how pricey they are, I spent a total of $48 + tips on this terrible haircut)Now, my hair was the longest it has been in years, almost down to my upper lip; so she had a lot to work with. I ended up with hair on top that is much shorter than I would've liked, and sides that are blended terribly. My hair has no style whatsoever. She proceeded to shave my neck against the grain, which was painful. The complimentary massage was not offered, I was not asked how I liked the haircut. The seat wasn't even lowered before she decided it was time for me to leave. I would've said something but I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible; there is no fixing this cut without making it shorter than I like my hair to be.Basically, go somewhere else.

Since that is by far the most important quality when it comes to sushi, my experience started out on the right foot. When I was seated, I was immediately served water with cucumber which was a wonderful surprise. If you've never had the pleasure of eating sushi and cleansing your palate with cucumber infused water, you're missing out! I started with the Miso Soup and it was very good. I ordered the Lychee Martini in hopes of trying something a little different. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a very light and refreshing cocktail. Something I'd happily order again. For my meal I ordered the Maki Roll, Mellow Yellow Roll, and two pieces of Salmon Sashimi. Everything was wonderful! The Mellow Yellow Roll is so unique and beautiful. The presentation of both rolls was very impressive. I've noticed several complaints regarding the prices of the sushi. Sushi is quite similar to steak in that pricing dictates quality. So if you can't tell the difference between a $10 Applebees Steak and a $40 Ruth's Chris steak, by all means, go to Applebees. Yes, Niu B is a bit higher on the sushi price scale, but it was worth the price. My next trip to Chicago will lead me right back here to try out the other rolls that Niu B has to offer.

So it was disappointing to see that they never brought along their signature dishes like Japanese Fried Rice, Red curry or their signature drinks - Sake Mojito, Green Tea Zen Mojito. Ah well, I quelled my disappointment and sat down to dinner with a friend who was a regular customer at the original Niu. The waiter came in literally 30 sec after we sat to see if we wanted appetizers. Clearly he was new to this - he did that a few times (coming too soon to take the order) and even gave us our check without asking if we wanted dessert. Ah well - such things happen in a new place with someone who didn't seem like he had been a waiter before. I am sure he will get better and friendlier with time. However to give him credit - when we had initially asked for some chili sauce on the side, he said he didn't have any (only the sweet chili version) but later on he did find chili sauce and bring it to us. Definitely nice of him to do that. The food was quite good - I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer that came with oranges, edamame and avocado. The sushis I ordered - the Flamer was great but the other one with the Alaskan crab was ok. I had about 4 pieces each left on my orders which I asked them to pack for me to take with me. (I came home to discover that two of the Flamer pieces were missing which seems really odd - not sure what happened there but I don't want to speculate). I looked at the fairly large check (~$120 for 2 people - this included 4 drinks) and they had charged us $1.00 for some chili/ spicy sauce we ordered on the side - are you kidding me? For 1-2 tablespoons? The woman who seemed to be the manager had the nerve to tell me that they did the same at the other Niu when I said I was a regular there. I have eaten at Niu for 4 years and I have never had to pay for a side of sauce. I miss \"Chai\" from the original Niu - he was so nice. She did then take it off the check but that definitely added to the less than superb experience we were having there. Overall it seemed more expensive compared to Niu especially for the rolls ($!5). I doubt I would go back anytime soon despite it being so close to home for me. I still miss the signature dishes from Niu and maybe its just the hiccups that come with a new place but unless they added those dishes on the menu, I might just go to the original Niu even if it is farther away.

The presentation of both rolls was very impressive. I've noticed several complaints regarding the prices of the sushi. Sushi is quite similar to steak in that pricing dictates quality. So if you can't tell the difference between a $10 Applebees Steak and a $40 Ruth's Chris steak, by all means, go to Applebees.

Absolutely. \u00a0Expensive? Absolutely not. \u00a0Gene (we'll get back to him later) clearly spends a great deal of time handpicking excellent wines, all at exceptional values. \u00a0He and his staff pride themselves on recommending killer wines with very small price tags. \u00a0Seriously-- one of my new favorites is a Cab from South Africa that retails there for $10.99. \u00a0Yes, I said Cab from South Africa. \u00a0I would pay double for it. \u00a0It's really good.The staff loves wine. \u00a0But they don't love wine in a pushy, overbearing kind of way. \u00a0They are available to shop with you, or they are perfectly fine standing back and letting you do your own thing. \u00a0They love wine in a \"we want you to love the bottle of wine that you leave with\" kind of way. \u00a0Ask any of them for a recommendation. \u00a0I do every time. \u00a0I can't help it. \u00a0They're always spot-on. \u00a0Besides that, they are so incredibly laid back and cool. \u00a0I mean, you almost want to pull up a chair, hang out, and share a bottle right there in the store.Lastly, what finally prompted me to join Yelp...I stopped by earlier today to pick up a bottle for this afternoon. \u00a0I tied the dogs outside, ran in, grabbed something I'd never tried before, couldn't resist scanning the rest of their selection...

Just after the hostess seated us, the manager came over and offered a better table right next to the first one, which I appreciated.My Martini was nice. Not stand-and-applaud nice, but good. I'm a Martini snob and hard to please with my gin, so \"good\" is actually real praise. Gin selection was pretty standard so I chose Hendrix, the olives were crisp with no fillings, a cut above what I expect from most restaurants or bars. I didn't think to ask for it stirred so they shook it. Next time...Bread and oil clued us in that we'd made a good choice. The bread was fresh and firm but delicate, not fancied up with herbs and spices, likewise the oil. No nonsense, just quality.Our waiter took excellent care of us. There was a misunderstanding (or was it) about the glass of white my date ordered, so he comped us the first one he'd brought before bringing the one she did order. I have a hunch, no real basis for this, that the \"mistake\" was really more like, \"nah, have one of these.\" The first one was the one we finished.We each had salad. Generous portions but not overly huge trying to make a point like at some places, just good bowls of veggies. Perfectly fresh, with just the right amount of dressing. Spot on.The menu is long and varied, thoughtful Italian classic. We'd both had stressful days after a run of stressful weeks and I just couldn't make up my mind. All I knew was that I wanted a good glass of flavorful red wine along with a meal to go with it, so I asked for our waiter's recommendation on the wine. He nodded and said \"I'll bring you something nice.\" What to go with it, I asked? \"Meat.\" Uh well yeah okay, but... Without hesitation he suggested the t-bone. Fine, I'll have that! I don't eat a lot of red meat these days but if that's the recommendation...And, oh my goodness.What a steak. Big. Excellent quality, well marbled just the slightest hair toward fatty, tender, seasoned brilliantly. I ordered it rare and it came out just right. The side of white beans were seasoned to complement the steak in a rare and wonderful way. This was not some fancied-up dish trying to get into a trendy magazine, it was a classic Italian meal meant to please a hungry appetite, and oh did it.My date said her pasta was just a hair toward hard but otherwise fine. I can't say much else about it because I didn't try any, had my face too deeply buried in my meat. She tried a few bites, and nodded along with me.Dessert: apple pie with vanilla ice cream, as good as everything else, not an afterthought like desserts can sometimes seem to be. Even the berries next to it were carefully selected.I had a shot of espresso that made me grin. Like with gin, I'm hard to please with my coffee and this was terrific, just excellent, deep foamy crema, flavorful but not at all bitter.

Perfectly al dente pasta, half a Maine lobster and enough sauce to make each mouthful a heavenly experience.We were stuffed by the time our wonderful waiter thrust dessert menus in our hands, so we only ordered the hazelnut gelato to share.

Meanwhile, however, we noticed that other patrons were treated in a more friendly manner. It seems that most of the clientele here are older. My fianc\u00e9 and I are in our late 20's, and we can't help but feel like there's some sort of age discrimination going on with us being ignored while meanwhile the waiters joke around and chat with the older patrons. I understand that these people may be regulars, but the staff should recognize that other patrons (such as ourselves) have the potential to become regulars too--if we receive good service.All in all, it's not a bad restaurant, but between the just ok food, unfriendly service, and fairly high prices for pasta, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon, despite the fact that it's nearby.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 6, 6]}, "4": {"description": "I ordered spaghetti vongole and carbonara.

The good is that a lot of their products are less expensive than other brands and tend to be healthier and fresher than the average inexpensive brand.

Really inexpensive and high quality coconut water, soy yogurt, fruit juice, and tortilla chips, for example, compared to average brands. If you're a lazy vegetarian there are a lot of nice frozen vegetarian meals. The produce is often unnecessarily wasteful with packaging and not always so fresh looking.

I follow a large number of tattoo blogs, have looked through most of the big-name Chicago-based artists' portfolios, gotten work from half a dozen people, and most of my friends have one or more tattoos and similar obsessions with wearable art. And when anyone asks me for advice on where to get a new piece, I only have one answer: \"Code of Conduct.\" So far, my girlfriend, her friend, one of my best friends, my boss, and another colleague have all taken this advice with incredible results.The shop:The atmosphere is clean and bright without being clinical somehow. Workstations are arranged around a large common area so everyone can watch and learn from each other. There's a lot of hovering and \"that's awesome how did you do it?\" among the artists, which I enjoy. The walls are decorated with sketches, oil paintings, photographs, and other forms of art, all of which is created or curated by the staff. With no piercers on their payroll, unlike other tattoo shops Code of Conduct is exclusively about the art (and a touch of fashion thrown in), with less of a focus on walk-in business and more focus on custom work than some may be used to at other \"tattoo and piercing factories.\"The staff:So far I only wear work by one of the artists at Code of Conduct - more on him shortly - but in the many many hours I've spent in the shop, I have seen incredible work spring from under the hands of every member of the staff. Each definitely has his own style and strengths but they all share knowledge, advice, techniques, and a strong drive to constantly better their craft. Plus, they're friendly, hilarious, and very laid-back. Because they take their work very seriously (like any artist should), if you're looking to walk in with a google image of someone else's tattoo that you think is really cool and want the same thing, this probably isn't the place for you. If you want an incredible, unique, custom piece of art that requires you to give some effort and forethought, research portfolios and make an appointment.My guy:I first explored Allie Sider's digital portfolio back in 2009 and was immediately jealous of the people who got to wear his ink. Even from a distance, his attention to minutiae and skill with black-and-grey were mind-boggling, and I can personally guarantee you that it only gets more impressive up close. I'm a visual artist and lighting designer by trade, so you can imagine how floored I was to find a tattoo artist that actually thought about light sources and shadows! Allie manages to work in some of the finest, tiniest details I've ever seen, his lines are always super clean, and his shading techniques vary from intricate pencil-thin crosshatching to sublimely smooth watercolor, depending on the piece. He has a very light hand and gets it done without chewing your skin up, so his work heals much faster than others' (I'm talking like a week, week and a half at most!). Plus he's a great guy that I can actually have a conversation with for hours on end - and all my friends who wear his work agree. In the five years I've been visiting him, Allie has done my entire upper back, a small piece on my left arm, and we're halfway done with a full shoulder-to-wrist sleeve on my right arm. For black-and-grey (he does do color sometimes, it's just \"not his thing\"), as far as I'm concerned there's none better.

I had recently visited Deluxe tattoo to get a consultation on a piece I had been wanting. The man there said it was impossible and would look stupid on the body. O RLY? Well Johnny McDevitt did it just yesterday. And let me tell you, it looks amazing. so many people are giving me compliments (while the sucker is still covered in goo-goo-overnight-bandage-blood. They are either all correct that it is awesome, or they are vampires. Highly unlikely. Also, I was quoted at a lot of other shops in price ranges going into the 500+...never in my life for something this size. Its about 7 x 5 inches. Only 6 colors used. No way. Johnny asked for 400, I said I didn't want to go beyond 350, and he agreed. I knew I'd be paying the above average price for myself, considering I normally go to small - town shops in Southern ILL, so for a Chicago tatt THIS nice...It was perfectly reasonable. No stiffler's here. Sadly, Johnny McDevitt is transferring to Insight Studios tattoo. I will most definitely be contacting him in the future. I believe he is the nicest tattoo artist I have ever met. He is open for a joke, ready to converse (or not if you need a moment to breath, haha). He was so patient . This was my 4th tattoo, but I had \u00a0not had one on the front of my body before where I could WATCH, so I was pretty anxious. It was like he was just so happy to be there doing something different, he didn't even care if I was letting out the few occasional \"ow, ow, ow's\". It took maybe 3 weeks to solidify a time and a day, but it was very much worth it , and we BOTH were to blame for the complications and issues outside of the world of tattoos, so there was nothing but forgiveness :) \u00a0I will be posting a picture very soon.

Good stuff for a hungry dinner/late night situationCon: A little bit pricey though in my opinion, $23 for large 2 topping, and the 1 topping wasn't that much cheaper like $20-$21 if I remember correctly, and it doesnt stop there, the Medium or one size down at 14 was only a few dollars cheaper at like $19-$20.

I bought the Yelp deal ($75 of services for $50) and figured I'd try this place out. First, I didn't realize that the Yelp deal has to be used all at once (it's not like a gift card where they keep a balance - if you don't get $75 worth of services, that's too bad). So that was annoying, but the girl at the front was really helpful and suggested a reflexology foot massage ($15) to add to the mani/pedi to hit the $75 total. The atmosphere is really clean and appealing and the music is soothing. I love the leather chairs for the spa pedicure - so much nicer than the big, bulky massage chairs (though, those have their moments too). I also noticed that a couple of people had brought their own wine - so apparently it's a byob nail place, which is great. The lowdown:Spa pedicure - Fantastic. She did a good job on my toes and getting my feet to feel closer to normal. At the end of the pedicure, they put some kind of chocolate mud mask on your feet and lower legs. Awesome. Reflexology foot massage - Save your money! It was terrible. It didn't hurt or anything, but at the end of a long day, if I'm getting a foot massage, I want my feet massaged. Paying $15 for 10 minutes of someone to very gently rubbing my feet to the point that I can barely feel it is not worth it. I've have better leg/foot massages from people just giving me a regular spa pedicure. Manicure - Looks good so far. I'm not sure how long it will hold up, but one day in it still looks great. Polish Color Selection: Good, not great. I didn't have any problems finding a color that I wanted, so I have no complaints. They have a good range of colors, just not every single color that has come out in the last two years (which can be overwhelming if you're not sure what kind of color you want to go with).

I was relieved when she recommended the brisket and said it was her favorite. Great, that's decided.We ordered the house wings as a shared appetizer. I ordered the brisket with a side of smoked mac & cheese. My friends both ordered the pulled pork with mac & cheese and cheesy corn as their respective sides. \u00a0After 5 minutes of mouthwatering anticipation, our server comes back to inform us that they are out of brisket. They are also out of mac & cheese. \u00a0I laugh thinking the server was just trying to be funny because we had just had a long conversation where she was recommending the brisket and it was only 6:30PM on a Saturday. I was sad to find out she was not joking. I changed my order to the ribs with a side of cheesy corn and ordered a beer. \u00a0She comes back and tells me they are out of the beer I ordered. Later during dinner my friend ordered a different beer that they were also out of.This was opening week so some learning curve was expected, but they were out of brisket, mac & cheese, and 2 of the beers that were on the menu so early in the evening. That is just poor planning.Now to the food that was served. The house wings were amazing. Apparently they are prepared in a pressure cooker so the skin has a nice snap to it and the meat is juicy. \u00a0I definitely recommend the wings. I tried some of my friends' pulled pork and thought it was good and they both really liked theirs. The sauces were above average, albeit a little runny. The ribs were pretty decent too but nothing special. The cheesy corn was not for me, nor was the coleslaw.As mentioned, I thought the service was good. I was a little disappointed that the manager didn't offer an apology or explanation for why they were out of so much on a Saturday prior to dinner rush. You'd think when 4 of the things that are listed on the menu are not available that you'd be offered a complimentary drink, dessert, or at least an explanation. The final issue was when it came to the bill. \u00a0We asked our server to split up the bill evenly 3 ways and gave her our 3 credit cards. The credit cards were run for 50%, 25%, and 25%. That is not an even split. It was busy so we just paid it as is and worked out the difference among ourselves with cash.I will return to try the brisket.

The experience started off great. Nice d\u00e9cor, good space, seated within 10 minutes of my reservation. We had drinks at the bar while waiting for the table and the bar service was great.Once at the table, our server was very friendly and attentive. \u00a0I came in knowing exactly what I wanted (brisket) but I asked her opinion of what was good. I was relieved when she recommended the brisket and said it was her favorite. Great, that's decided.We ordered the house wings as a shared appetizer. I ordered the brisket with a side of smoked mac & cheese. My friends both ordered the pulled pork with mac & cheese and cheesy corn as their respective sides. \u00a0After 5 minutes of mouthwatering anticipation, our server comes back to inform us that they are out of brisket. They are also out of mac & cheese. \u00a0I laugh thinking the server was just trying to be funny because we had just had a long conversation where she was recommending the brisket and it was only 6:30PM on a Saturday. I was sad to find out she was not joking. I changed my order to the ribs with a side of cheesy corn and ordered a beer. \u00a0She comes back and tells me they are out of the beer I ordered. Later during dinner my friend ordered a different beer that they were also out of.This was opening week so some learning curve was expected, but they were out of brisket, mac & cheese, and 2 of the beers that were on the menu so early in the evening. That is just poor planning.Now to the food that was served. The house wings were amazing. Apparently they are prepared in a pressure cooker so the skin has a nice snap to it and the meat is juicy. \u00a0I definitely recommend the wings. I tried some of my friends' pulled pork and thought it was good and they both really liked theirs. The sauces were above average, albeit a little runny. The ribs were pretty decent too but nothing special. The cheesy corn was not for me, nor was the coleslaw.As mentioned, I thought the service was good. I was a little disappointed that the manager didn't offer an apology or explanation for why they were out of so much on a Saturday prior to dinner rush. You'd think when 4 of the things that are listed on the menu are not available that you'd be offered a complimentary drink, dessert, or at least an explanation. The final issue was when it came to the bill. \u00a0We asked our server to split up the bill evenly 3 ways and gave her our 3 credit cards. The credit cards were run for 50%, 25%, and 25%. That is not an even split. It was busy so we just paid it as is and worked out the difference among ourselves with cash.I will return to try the brisket. I do believe things will improve and they will get into their groove. \u00a0I do hope the management reads the above review for the constructive criticism it is and I look forward to seeing the improvements.", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 2, 2]}, "4": {"description": "This was their opening weekend so the bumps aren't unusual.

After some brief research regarding some of this type of cuisine close to the hotel, we decided on Tamarind. Our experience at this restaurant was very good.Food: We started with an order of potstickers, I had the Red Snapper Nirvana Maki (sushi roll), and my colleague had the Empress Chicken. For me, the potstickers were a bit of a 'miss', but they still delivered some of the traditional flavors I am used to. I prefer the outside to be crispier, and for the inside of the potsticker to have a little more flavor. They seemed to lack finesse and seasoning.My sushi roll, on the other hand, was dynamite! It tasted soooo incredibly fresh. The snapper on top of the roll had ZERO fishy aftertaste -- something that I sometimes get, even from some of the better known sushi places in my area. Everything was so, so fresh. I don't know how else to describe it. It was one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in my life (6 / 5 stars - bonus point)My colleagues Empress chicken was also spot-on. It was like if General Tso, Orange Chicken, and Sesame Chicken all had a threesome, and the fundamental DNA of all three dishes made it into the baby that was produced. It was not super unique, as it had all of the traditional features of the aforementioned dishes; but it did pack a unique flavor profile that was extremely pleasant. Additionally, the chicken was cooked marvelously. Nice and crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the inside. Bravo.Food: 5 / 5Service: The service was pleasant, but very rushed. I suspect it was a result of the conference being in town, but either way it was kind of a bummer to receive some more individualized service. As I have mentioned in previous posts, I am into receiving a quality experience where I dine. Although great food is nice, and equally great experience is just as valuable to me. Tamarind provided a mediocre experience in terms of service.Service: 3 / 5Atmosphere: Other reviewers have complained about dirtiness in the restaurant. I did not experience as such. However, Tamarind is in an old building, in downtown Chicago. Cockroaches would not surprise me if they were infested in the building; but I did not see any, and would assume that the restaurant is doing all it can to protect its space from a building that is likely in need of some serious renovation. Unfortunately, I just don't think that is feasible given the location of the building.Despite that, I really like the furnishings and interior of the restaurant. I never felt as if it was unclean, and thought that it really set a nice mood for enjoying a great meal.Atmosphere: 4 / 5Price: My sushi roll was $11, and my colleagues food was $9. The potstickers were $5. Although the potstickers were not worth the $5 we paid (more like $3), the other meals far outweighed their value. I felt like I really got my money's worth for a high quality product.Price: 4 / 5Final Thoughts: I grew-up in NY with the benefit of having a lot of good Asian eateries at my disposal. I feel as if Tamarind is one of the more delicious places I have dined at. Although I may not necessarily return to Tamarind to dine-in.

So the food is still enjoyable even if you were looking for more authentic flavors (which, in this case -- you should probably hop over to Chinatown quickly as most Asian food in the loop is a bit more mild).In summary, I'll be back -- I know tons of friends who would love a restaurant like this, which is a in a convenient spot near many Chicago landmarks and offers a wide variety of options for everyone.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 24]}, "27": {"description": "Great service! \u00a0The menu is extremely huge.

Ordered chicken satay as an appetizer, what came was 4 deep fried (oozing with grease) chicken \"fingers\"! I tasted one and returned it, was horrible. The server just looked at me when I told her I expected grilled chicken. The peanut sauce was flavorless and probably came from a jar. Ugh, Next up was my entree of lemongrass beef, what arrived looked decent but was void of any hint of flavor let alone lemongrass. \u00a0The meat was hit or miss on tenderness but the veggies were good. I sent the white rice back because I don't eat it but the server offered no alternative. All in all a very marginal meal, lacking in flavor and disappointing since many reviews ranted about the food.

After some brief research regarding some of this type of cuisine close to the hotel, we decided on Tamarind. Our experience at this restaurant was very good.Food: We started with an order of potstickers, I had the Red Snapper Nirvana Maki (sushi roll), and my colleague had the Empress Chicken. For me, the potstickers were a bit of a 'miss', but they still delivered some of the traditional flavors I am used to. I prefer the outside to be crispier, and for the inside of the potsticker to have a little more flavor. They seemed to lack finesse and seasoning.My sushi roll, on the other hand, was dynamite! It tasted soooo incredibly fresh. The snapper on top of the roll had ZERO fishy aftertaste -- something that I sometimes get, even from some of the better known sushi places in my area. Everything was so, so fresh. I don't know how else to describe it. It was one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had in my life (6 / 5 stars - bonus point)My colleagues Empress chicken was also spot-on. It was like if General Tso, Orange Chicken, and Sesame Chicken all had a threesome, and the fundamental DNA of all three dishes made it into the baby that was produced. It was not super unique, as it had all of the traditional features of the aforementioned dishes; but it did pack a unique flavor profile that was extremely pleasant. Additionally, the chicken was cooked marvelously. Nice and crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the inside. Bravo.Food: 5 / 5Service: The service was pleasant, but very rushed. I suspect it was a result of the conference being in town, but either way it was kind of a bummer to receive some more individualized service. As I have mentioned in previous posts, I am into receiving a quality experience where I dine. Although great food is nice, and equally great experience is just as valuable to me. Tamarind provided a mediocre experience in terms of service.Service: 3 / 5Atmosphere: Other reviewers have complained about dirtiness in the restaurant. I did not experience as such. However, Tamarind is in an old building, in downtown Chicago. Cockroaches would not surprise me if they were infested in the building; but I did not see any, and would assume that the restaurant is doing all it can to protect its space from a building that is likely in need of some serious renovation. Unfortunately, I just don't think that is feasible given the location of the building.Despite that, I really like the furnishings and interior of the restaurant. I never felt as if it was unclean, and thought that it really set a nice mood for enjoying a great meal.Atmosphere: 4 / 5Price: My sushi roll was $11, and my colleagues food was $9. The potstickers were $5. Although the potstickers were not worth the $5 we paid (more like $3), the other meals far outweighed their value. I felt like I really got my money's worth for a high quality product.Price: 4 / 5Final Thoughts: I grew-up in NY with the benefit of having a lot of good Asian eateries at my disposal. I feel as if Tamarind is one of the more delicious places I have dined at. Although I may not necessarily return to Tamarind to dine-in. I would certainly get some takeout from here if I were ever in the area again.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 5]}, "9": {"description": "This place is pretty interesting -- the decor is great, the service is prompt, there's tons of choices on the menu, and the presentation and color of the food is excellent.The bad part is that it's a bit pricey (although not terrible for the loop) and not extremely authentic -- however with that said, if you're looking for a milder introduction to more unique Asian cuisine -- this place is perfect. It would be similar to taking something like PF Changs but introducing a couple more traditional ingredients and dishes to the mix -- being careful not to be too spicy or put in an excessive amount of oils and herbs.The flavors are really the only thing that I can really criticize as the portion size was pretty good, the textures were all on point, food temperature was good (although if you're sitting outside, remember Chicago is windy so your food will cool down quickly), and they use fresh ingredients instead of sauces to add flavor when possible. So the food is still enjoyable even if you were looking for more authentic flavors (which, in this case -- you should probably hop over to Chinatown quickly as most Asian food in the loop is a bit more mild).In summary, I'll be back -- I know tons of friends who would love a restaurant like this, which is a in a convenient spot near many Chicago landmarks and offers a wide variety of options for everyone.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 24]}, "26": {"description": "Disgusting.

Luckily, it's at least all 21+...they card you at the entrance. 2. Having said that...it's packed on the weekends.

It's red and black and trendy all over and I'm sure the suburbanites think its super hip to the tilt. I think it gauche and played out. OOooo, black and white photos of movie stars!? How creative! No. 4. Service is increasingly spotty. And, if you are attending a VIP showing of a movie, the entrances are up here through the Lobby Lounge. Great, except VIP means move your own damn drinks into the theater. I don't find this to be a very smooth transition. Super awkward for the price one is paying to be \"VIP\" and have the luxury of buying one's own drinks and moving them when the movie starts, and then trekking back to the bar to order more if that is desired. What is VIP about that!? Methinks not much. No service included in a steeeeeeep price? Um, fail. Especially when the regular tickets afford very nice cushy seats. I prefer Diet Coke with my movies anyhow. So there's the skinny...it's fine, and in a pinch it's OK for a drink, but I wouldn't make it a destination, nor do I think it's anything super-duper-special. It's fine.

Their drinks came and in the first sip was apparent the drink were incorrectly made...now that is a drink that is pretty difficult to screw up. We sat waiting for our waitress so that we could resolve the drink issue and move on to our conversation, and she never materialized. My two friends decided to take matters into their own hands and walked to the bar, which is a large rectangle in the center of the restaurant, and waited for 4 minutes to be asked if they needed help. Finally the bartendress asked if they needed help and upon replying yes, she promptly turned away from them with no comment and went back to the cash register. Now, being a Wed. night in January it wasn't a busy night so the business at the cash register being more important than the needs of a customer was difficult to understand. She eventually returned to them, and when told that the drinks were not right, she stated she had to research the drinks in the cash register/computer and argued that the waitress had selected \"soda\" instead of water. She eventually did replace the drinks. This episode took over 8 minutes and in the time it took, which was significant to our pre movie dinner, our food arrived. One friend ordered the appetizer sliders which she raved about and she is a hamburger aficionado. My other friend and I split a prosciutto pizza which unfortunately had cooled down quite a bit during the drink wait. The flavor was good though. We then were brought the bill as they are quite conscientious about making sure you make your movie which is good. However, when the bill was brought the waitress said the computer was to blame for the drink mix up. When we looked at the bill it took all our control not to laugh or make snide comments.

Wonderful setting for drinks and light fare after work or late evening, with or without a movie. It will be even better after all of the S&TC girlz nights have been completed. Although, I went for one of these and it was a blast. I had a cocktail while waiting for me girlz to show up and then we went to the theater. They announce your show in the lounge so you won't have to miss it and since seats are assigned, no need to rush!! GREAT IDEA. The place however leaves little to be desired by seasoned lounge professionals such as myself. We've been doing the Chicago Scene for a long time and just don't get impressed when we see contemporary furniture, flat screen TVs and fancy drinks. The drinks were slightly over priced. In the Lounge they offered specialty Sex & The City cocktails made with Moet Champagne for a decent price of $12. They offered Prosecco for $6. Outside of our theater where they had set up a makeshift bar for our noted 'convenience' the same specialty drinks were being made in a plastic cup with Prosecco (NOT Moet) for $1 more. Guess they think we're really dumb. I guess so because we bought them, against my better judgment. After the show, we went into the Lobby Lounge for food and drinks, we were seated after a short wait and the food was OK. Pizza's were bland and the mini burgers were basic. The fried potato chips were great from what I was told. The most unappealing event of the evening is the catastrophe in order to bring a very small 6inch cake in for a friend. As this was our first time dining here, we were not aware there was a $20 cutting fee. I asked them to store my cake during the film. Afterward, I pleaded to give me my cake and they would not allow us to have our cake because there's a cutting fee and they have their own cake. Warning... do not bring a cake there. I completely understand a cutting fee for a large cake but the little cake I brought in was so tiny that we could cut if ourselves with a butter knife. Not even a big deal. This pretentious attitude turned us ALL off. We'd rather go to a restaurant that costs much more and be treated much better. The \"manager\" Mario even came out to watch over us so that we did not eat our cake in his restaurant. Pathetic. New venues tend to rise and fall in this city and it's usually because they are not run with the customer in mind. They want to get as many people in and bamboozle them with overpriced crap that when people finally realize they've been fooled they stop going and the place usually falls off rapidly. Note to Mario: take care of your customers and they will take care of you! Allow them the opportunity to have their little cake and inform them of your policy as well as the awesome cake you have to offer and guarantee that they will return the next time they need cake and overpriced drinks!

The staff were friendly and invited us to come in, but despite having almost no customers it took a long time to find someone to change the channel, and take our order. We each ordered a burger, me the turkey burger with jalapeno coleslaw and my fiancee a beef burger with fries. The burgers were fine but a bit messy, the only problem being that the tomatoes in mine were decidedly mealy which I think should have been evident to an experienced cook. My slaw had no discernible jalapeno, and my fiancee's fries were soggy and oily and we couldn't bring ourselves to do more than try a few before abandoning them. Also challenging was that the plates were narrow ovals each covered with a much larger swath of wax paper. Because they weren't sized or fit together, food or ketchup on the paper would start to drift off the plate and start dribbling on the counter.On the way in, the dessert case had several options that looked good, and we ordered carrot cake and coffee. The carrot cake really was delicious, but they only brought one fork even though we ordered just one dessert between the two of us and specifically mentioned that we were looking to share it. It took a while for the dessert to arrive although it wasn't clear why, given the lack of crowd and the fact that it was coming from the case at the end of the bar. We waited to start eating the dessert until the coffee arrived, but when the bar attendant returned several minutes after bringing the carrot cake, she didn't have any coffee. When we asked her about it, she apologized and mentioned that she simply forgotten the order. She then poured it from the station that was right next to where she was standing when we ordered it the first time.Other things we noticed when we compared notes afterward were that the dessert menu didn't mention many of the items in the dessert case in front, and the chalkboard specials menu had a few misspellings. To be clear, the hostess and staff at the bar were extremely friendly and polite, but the experience accumulated a lot of disappointments that could have been helped by better management and better attention to detail.

Don't even THINK about visiting SLC.I've walked past SLC for years without ever having an inclination to stop in. Yesterday one of my coworkers decided that she wanted to have a gathering there so a dozen of us decided to walk over there.We got there about 5:15 and there was only one big party there. There was a huge group of men there about 20 deep. We sat right next to them even though the other side of the restaurant was empty. There were about 15 of us in my group.There was one waitress there. She was an older lady and she appeared to work solo until after 7pm or so. There was a bartender and another guy who was probably the restaurant manager. We waited at least 15 minutes before the waitress even came to the table to take our order. She didn't write anyone's order down so we figured she'd screw it up. Even then she didn't take the order of everyone at the table. She came back several times in between running to the cash register and tending to the other patrons. After the order was taken it took eons for our drinks and food to arrive. Two of my friends ordered cheese fries that never even arrived. When asked about the fries, the waitress said she thought the fries had already come out!! Seriously??? Even then she never saw to it that the fries were served. The pizza I ordered took over an hour to come out. When I inquired with the waitress about why it was taking so long she gave me a deer in the head lights look. I don't believe she'd even submitted the order to the kitchen.The waitress mixed up everyone's order and had a terrible time keeping our individual tickets straight. I had to ask four different times for my check and it the waitress must have questioned me about it at least 3 separate times. Finally, a second waitress came over to figure out what was happening and to assist. Even then the check was still wrong. I was charged for two drinks when I only ordered one. Whatever. It was easier just to get the $7 overcharge from my friend and avoid another debacle. The service was SLOOOOOW. The food was terrible too which made the experience worse. The pizza I waited ages for was gross as were the chicken wings I nippled on. The wings and curly fries had no flavor whatsoever. The only thing that was halfway decent was the complimentary popcorn. The cocktail I had (called the Eager Beaver) was decent but it tasted more like fruit juice than alcohol. After the check was settled the older waitress came to me and apologized for the \u00a0dreadful service. She stated she was new and struggled with having to take care of the entire restaurant. She stated that she was an \"idiot\" but that she wasn't \"that dumb.\" She was embarrassed by the situation and simply wished to apologize. I appreciated her effort and thoughtfulness. Honestly, I think if she'd stated up front that it would have made a world of difference. I don't blame her. I blame the restaurant's management. Why would you leave a new employee to handle the Friday night after work happy hour rush?? The bathroom was also dreadful. One of the stalls was locked because it appeared to be leaking. The open stall also had a leak from the bottom of the toilet. Little did we know that it also had a leak at the top!! When you flushed the toilet water shot out at you!!! My friend got her shoes wet as a result. Luckily, she warned me so I knew to open the stall door before I flushed and be ready to run. I should call the health department on the restaurant because that has to be some violation. Who wants nasty sewer water sprayed all over them while they're eating? It's negligent and irresponsible of the restaurants mgmt that a plumber hasn't been called to fix the leak. For a dive bar the restaurant was actually cozy. The decor and seating was spacious and comfortable. Judging by the outside I expected alot worse but it really was a nice atmosphere. It's too bad that the terrible service cancels all the positive things out.At any rate, SLC was a one and done experience for me.

My friends and I decided to check out this bar about a month ago based off the great reviews on yelp. When we first arrived we were slightly confused because there is the bar and then there are tables. Since there was a group of four of us we chose the tables. What made this process confusing was that we waited for several minutes but no one came to serve us, so we were not sure if we had to go up to the bar or wait an eternity to come serve us. That was more so awkward than a huge deal, we just went up to the bar and ordered. We loved the beer and the environment and were overall having a great time. Towards the end of our time there, we noticed that the table behind us was getting service but not us, but at this point we did not care. I asked the man (his name is Craig with a \"C\" as he later bluntly told me) for our check. When he arrived with the check, he had added my boyfriend and my bill with our friends' bill. When we asked about this, as we had all ordered separately he stated that it was easier for the bar to do so. This was perplexing to me especially because there were no signs around stating this was the policy. I asked Craig for a pen so I could circle who had what. Craig hastily stated that he could just be informed of how we wanted to split the bill. However, when I began to tell him he rolled his eyes and then requested we split the items. After a few minutes of attempting to remember and almost calculating whose was whose, Craig returned and ripped the check out of my friend's hand and stated that this was not \"rocket science\" and stormed off. When Craig returned, I asked to speak to the manager due to the unbelievable amount of disrespect he had now shown us and I was told that he was the manager that night! I asked him why he had been rude to us this entire time and he stated that he had not because he had only started serving us (giving away his awful service once again). Needless to say he continued to argue with me until I finally requested to speak with his boss. In the end he continued to make errors on the separation of the check and did not even give my friend his card back originally. Also Craig was taking shots behind the bar, which is absolutely unprofessional especially if you are the manager. Although I have not called his boss, I am writing about my experience here.

Well the woman at B Bella starts off by asking if I want my manicure \"pulled off or drilled off?\"... Uhhh... neither - Both sound painful?! \u00a0When I explain what I was told by the other technician, Nelly at B Bella huffs off to the back of the store and begrudgingly gets stuff to soak the Gel-ish off. \u00a0I sat forever in 10 make shift things that I can only describe as tinfoil-finger-nobs not understanding how loosely wrapped cotton and foil was going to provide any of the necessary elements to get the polish off. \u00a0Tons of Acetone evaporation combined with no friction and no pressure left me with nails that only looked slightly worse than when I had come in 40 minutes earlier.Nelly then takes one of the coarsest grade nail files I've ever encountered and starts going over the TOP of my nails. \u00a0At this point in time, I'm fighting a bit of a panic but rationalize that obviously this stuff needs to be filed off since sitting for 40 minutes did nothing. \u00a0I also rationalize that a person who has been doing nails for as long as she said she has been wouldn't do anything that would eff up my nails. \u00a0This MUST be some sort of magic nail file... NOPE!!! \u00a0I have nails that are as thin and razor sharp as a new born baby's with all these thin spots across the top that a week later are still unbelievably sensitive whenever I pick something up or brush against anything.I was heading out of town on vacation two days after coming into B Bella and basically decided that the best course of action was to cover up my nails and continue on with the No-Chip because I had at least seen the comparable Gel-ish in action and knew that it looked good.... I deserve to be slapped up-side the head for having that thought after witnessing what I had already been through at this salon. \u00a0The No-Chip was a mess (color me shocked on that one) so I finally tucked my tail between my legs, paid, and ran away from B Bella after 2.5 hours of stupidity on my part and walked IMMEDIATELY to the salon where I got my Gel-ish done (Salon Vision) to have them take everything off. \u00a0The nice woman at Salon Vision gently took the stuff off in 10 minutes using the same amount of time and same process she told me the Gel-ish would be. \u00a0She then looked at my nails and told me she would buff out as many of the deep scratches as possible but because my nails were so thin, she could only do so much... I know this was a long rant but sometimes you read these reviews and people give 1 star after complaining that 1 thing was wrong and I always think that they may be blowing things out of proportion if only 1 thing was bad. \u00a01) painful nails 2) thin nails 3) scratched nails 4) terrible quality 5) 2.5 hours long 6) stupid me.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 7, 6]}, "32": {"description": "This is the first yelp review I've ever posted and it's well deserved. \u00a0I bought the groupon for my girlfriend thinking it would be a nice gesture. \u00a0Unfortunately, it backfired horribly. \u00a0It was the worst nail / salon experience she has ever had. \u00a0DO NOT GO HERE. \u00a0Her appointment for a mani-pedi took 3 hours!Here are the highlights:* Her nail was cut so badly that it bled for an hour and would not stop. \u00a0The employee that was doing her mani/pedi tried to wait for her finger to stop bleeding but after an hour she painted OVER THE BLOOD. \u00a0She said it was a very painful.* Because it was taking so long, her parking meter ticket was running out. \u00a0She had put 2 hours in the meter and, because her nails were wet from the pedicure, another employee offered to add time to her meter for her. \u00a0She asked the employee to add $5 for another hour & 1/2 because they hadn't even started her manicure yet. \u00a0The employee returned explaining that she only put $1 in the meter because she was SURE she would be done in that amount of time. \u00a0Since my girlfriend was getting her nails done, she couldn't get up and take care of it herself - so instead she had to worry about getting a ticket. \u00a0By the time she finally got to her car, it had been w/o a meter ticket for 40 minutes.* As if this wasn't enough, the employee insulted my girlfriends hair. \u00a0She had just gotten it cut last weekend and the employee pointed out that she thought it didn't look good and she needed to get it cut. \u00a0My girlfriend noted that she wasn't happy with it either and and the employee actually said that's why she asks all her clients if they're happy before they leave. \u00a0Clearly, she didn't ask if my girlfriend was happy with this experience.Long story short (as my mom likes to say) - this was a terrible experience and this place does not deserve your money or time.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 4, 8]}, "54": {"description": "A much needed addition to the South Loop.

I also ultimately noticed they didn't give me a receipt and were unable to pull it up to check if I had already paid for it or if I was paying extra for fries I clearly ordered. They also didn't include my epic sauce on the side when asked. When approaching the cashier who took my order, he walked off and deferred it to someone else, which to me seemed very off putting. Luckily my friends and I were able to ultimately get all the components of my meal which were missing, but I had lost my appetite initially due to the sub-par customer service. I ended up getting everything I wanted but after the employees not exactly having the best tone about it. I ended up eating maybe 15-20 minutes after my friends did due to the amount of missing items plus feeling less excited about my meal due to how the employees made me feel. I'll come back for the food, but hoping service improves and that I get what I order.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 1, 26]}, "55": {"description": "Great food, great staff! \u00a0I'm visiting from New York and was told to try these burgers.

The cooked patties are then surrounded by the sweet, sweet love of an excellent bun.

And add a star. This is one of those reviews, where you're not sure you want to divulge the information because you snottily don't want someone to have the same goodies as you (but I'm working through that selfishness people).JEROME CAN DO HAIR YALL!!!!! YAAASSSSSSSS! YAAASSSSSSS!Let me tell you, I woke up this morning a BRAND NEW WOMAN! Full thick hair, bounce, shine, style...that hair did everything but put my celebrity crush in bed next to me...and if I got my ass to CA, it could possibly do that too!I was super elated when I found an amazing eyebrow stylist...but now I have the \"it\" factor in the hair category, an amazing artist (hair is a true art). I'm not just looking for pretty hair. I want healthy, strong, and gorgeous hair. I can check that off the list. 2015...watch out!!!! So, run your happy asses to Magid's Hair Studio and ask for Jerome! ----------------------Okay there are so many conflicting views on here about this Salon. So as a long time client that has used three different stylists, let me give you my honest feedback: After 7 years, this salon is far from perfect and at times I've strayed away to visit other stylist to see if I could find better. The reason that I've comeback time and time again is because as a natural head, I needed long lasting results and for the most part I got that here. Magid aka \"Magic\": He's the owner and he was the very first stylist I went to prior to his current location. I believe that he's good at his craft for basic blow outs. Joseph (the brother): I love his personality, but more so, he is really talented with a flat iron. He listens to his clients and he cares about what they want. The case majority of photos on my yelp are blowouts from him! I ended up being Joseph's client for the last 5+ years. Jerome: On a recommendation from Joseph, I wanted more creativity with my natural hair. My hair had finally reached a really great length and constant blowouts for me were not a way of necessarily retaining the length. I really love Jerome's capability and understanding with natural hair. I feel so confident about having more control of my hair shed, my product knowledge, and making sure that at the end of the day I have the healthiest head of hair possible. He's now my main stylist and I'm really happy. The Cons: - I personally don't think this is the type of salon you come to for custom color or for any other style aside from a simple blow out. - if you want the latest cut, I don't think it's going to be here either. They really just specialize in natural hair. It's the bulk of their business. While individual stylists do varying degrees of stuff, recognize the overall capabilities of the salon. - I don't get perms/relaxers or any color from here. Wait actually once I did get color, but it was minimal and I honestly can't recall, but I was satisfied with the results. Honestly, I'd only go to a place that I KNEW specialized in it or did a significant amount of color in a week. - the one barber they have on staff is RUDE and HONORARY. He doesn't know how to respect women or keep a professional demeanor around clients. I literally took a star off, because I choose off days to avoid this man! This is a family owned business. The brothers are really great and they're kind. Advice: use sound judgement when deciding to get chemicals put in your head from a salon that has more business doing the opposite. You can expect to be in and out on time. The location is good and there's plenty of paid parking. Hair is a really finicky thing.

After living here for almost three years, my wife and I were SO excited to finally have a restaurant within our complex. We decided to meet my sister at Chop for supper last night, a Friday evening. Since I'm usually more time-sensitive, I chose to head on down to Chop to secure our table. We had a reservation for 3 at 5PM. I arrived and the first thing I thought was \"Where's the rest of the restaurant?\". This place is tiny TINY. I'm guessing they have tables for maybe 50 diners, at most. In addition, many of the tables and chairs backed up into each other, and I can't imagine it's very comfortable in there if it ever gets crowded.Anyway, I was shown to my booth, and a few minutes later, my sister arrived. We decided to wait for my wife before ordering, and had water. If you're looking for a quiet place, this is NOT your kinda joint. The music was excruciatingly loud, and despite sitting directly across from each other, we couldn't hear each other without yelling and cupping our hands behind our ears. We asked our server (Tommy) if he could do something about that, and he accommodated us by turning the volume down a bit. It was somewhat better, so thanks. Right after that, I had to use the rest room, and the music was EVEN LOUDER in there than it was in the restaurant. I had to almost run out of there because I couldn't stand the sound level.My wife arrived not long after that and my sister and I asked for refills of our water. Almost simultaneously we both noticed an \"off\" smell to the water. Now, understand, we live in the same building, and I have to believe we share the same water supply as Chop, but the water was so bad, I couldn't drink mine, and my sister had to add the juice of an entire lemon. Had I not been very thirsty, I would have sent the water back, but I sipped it to quench my thirst. Yuk.My wife order a cocktail to start her night, and when it arrived, she was very pleased. The \"Garlands for the Dead\" was delicious. OK, good start.I ordered a blue cheese burger for my entre', my wife ordered Oysters Rockefeller and a Caesar Salad and my sister, after consulting with Tommy to ensure she understood the \"doneness\" of Chop's steaks, asked for a filet mignon, cooked medium. After not too long, our food arrived. The first thing my sister noticed was her steak was overcooked. Um, Tommy? He gets it, and returns the steak. So now my sister has to sit there with no food while my wife and I either eat our food, our we wait for her and our food gets cold. Very VERY bad sign.My sis tells us to go ahead, and I have to say my burger was good, although the size of the small cooked patty was dwarfed by the average-sized bun. \u00a0Now, things went from bad to worse. My wife's Oysters looked great, but they smelled \"off\" (here's that term again). We both have lived for extended periods of time on the Gulf of Mexico, so we've had oysters many times, and we know that they do have a particular odor to them. These, however, stunk like no oysters either of us had ever smelled. Rather than make a scene, my wife (who is very sensitive to smells) ate a couple and said they actually tasted pretty good, but on her third oyster, she put something very UN-oyster like in her mouth and almost immediately got sick to her stomach, spit it out and raced to the bathroom to be throw up. My sister followed her to the bathroom to check up on her. I called Tommy over and told him what had happened. We both immediately smelled the oysters again, and that's when it hit me - they smelled like feces. Yep, that's what I said. He took them away and went to tell the Chef. My sister came back after a couple minutes to report that my wife was still sick to her stomach and was trying everything possible to get the taste, smell and texture out of her mouth. Tommy came back and told us the Chef said \"that's how oysters smell\". Really?At that point, my sister and I decided we had no interest in eating anything that came from a kitchen that would serve something that smelled that horrendously, and that it would be best if we just left, paying for my wife's drink and leaving something for Tommy, as it wasn't his fault. We pushed our food aside and waited for my wife's return.My wife came back from the bathroom visibly and understandably upset, and she couldn't even stand to be in the restaurant. She left to go outside, and my sister and I spoke with the manager, Ashley. While apologetic, at this stage there wasn't much she could do.We were worried that my wife would end up in the ER, but luckily, after our experience ruined a rare night out for us, she's OK today.So, we won't be going back to Chop,EVER, and strongly recommend you take your hard-earned money elsewhere.

She looked so uncomfortable trying to say it, that we decided to let the question go unanswered rather than embarrass her further.Throwing caution to the winds, we ordered oysters anyway, and I'm glad we did. \u00a0They were on the small side, but very fresh, and the mignionette sauce and horseradishy cocktail sauce were both very good.We weren't in the mood for steak -- I might try one next time. \u00a0My burger, though not the medium rare I had ordered (more like medium well), was nevertheless tasty, as was my wife's turkey burger. \u00a0Fries were excellent as was the martini I ordered.In short, this is an ok restaurant for what it is -- a fun place to go before or after a movie. I don't expect that anyone will be going out of there way to visit this as a dining destination anytime soon, nor should they. That said, some effort to train staff about the food and drink offerings is definitely warranted. \u00a0Given that it is relatively new, I'm willing to overlook this and other issues that would definitely disqualify this for even three stars in a more established place.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 9, 21]}, "8": {"description": "Stopped here to eat before seeing a movie next door and in retrospect I should have just filled up at the concession stand.

Since the reviews were either loving it or hating it, I decided maybe the negative reviews were on a bad day. Well, we picked another bad day.First of all, the seating is horrible. There are approximately 6 booths that hold 3 adults in a C shape. They add chairs onto the tables to get 4 or 5 at these booths. This blocks the aisles and makes the place even more congested. It seems almost as if this was designed to be a bar, but they decided to add a dining room in the bar.On the other side of the \"dining room\" there are tables for 2 that are so close to each other, you might as well be dining with the table next to you. I am not into eating when the couple next to you can hear your conversation and vice versa. We had to wait for one of the booths, even though the dining room was not even half full. The other half of the room is the bar. There are no booths there, just high tables for 2 and the bar itself, which you can sit on the stools. It looks like a decent place to drink, but we were there to eat. Onto the meal....Service overall was good, even though there are many negative reviews. Our server tried, and so did the hostess. It's not their fault. Look what they're dealing with. This is a management and kitchen problem.Okay, so our waitress asked if we would like cocktails. We both ordered the Summer Harvest which tasted like syrup. It was supposedly \" good bourbon, seasonal syrup, ginger beer, and lemon. All we tasted was syrup. For $10 a pop, it should have had some effect on my brain cells.Next were the oysters Rockerfeller. They came out lukewarm. Taste was decent, but the temperature was way off.....negative stars. I didn't complain. I just don't like to send food back.The entrees came. Cowboy ribeye, medium rare. Was decent. I'm not sure if it's prime meat. It was chargrilled with nice marks on it and a hint of smokiness. However, it didn't deserve the pricetag of $38. My wife ordered the Buffalo Crossing Burger medium. I tried it because she said it wasn't that good and had come out of the kitchen cold. What it tasted like was a formerly good burger, and you know how you hate it when people press on a burger to squeeze the juice out of it while they're cooking it? That's what it tasted like...dried out meat. Sorry. I still didn't complain.Finally, I had the Scottish salmon. I ordered it med rare to medium. I told the server I hate well done salmon. Well, I got it and was really disappointed in the size of the portion. It's $22 and I got about a 5 oz. portion. \u00a0Lunch portions are usually bigger than this. I cut into it and because of it's shape, it was cooked well done on the thinner side and about medium well on the thicker side. I can't complain at this point because everything sucks. The risotto I ordered as a side literally tasted like white rice with cream poured over it. Tasteless. If you're going to put this on the menu and you have no idea how to make it, don't bother. \u00a0Get a box of Rice a Roni and charge $5 for it. It would be more palatable. I also got a side of creamed spinach. It was good and hot in a crock with melted cheese, but it was exactly what was on top of the Oysters Rockerfeller that I already ordered, so in essence, it seemed like a continuation of what I already had.We didn't do dessert. Why bother at this point?I received the bill. It was $129 before tip. I tipped 15% because again, I don't think it was the server's fault. However, I noticed the server had misunderstood me and ordered my salmon well done as it was reflected on the check. I did notice there was a lot of confusion at the kitchen window where the food comes out. I have been a server in my past life and know the look of \"hey cook, where's my.....?\" It is usually followed by bewildered looks of all the 3 cooks in plain view trying to figure out where it is or where it went, or who's going to cook this on the fly because the main entree is already on the table. This is a true and honest opinion of this place. We eat out at least 3 times a week. I am a bit picky because at this price point, I deserve to be. This place will not last unless these problems are fixed pronto. There are too many good places to eat in this town, and I would not waste my time returning.

We ended up getting amaretto sours and a half poured glass of moscato instead. The pours were so inconsistent because here first glass seemed like half a pour, but the next glass was over poured. Weird, again. Food was great, actually. However, they were out of the ribeye steak at 6 pm on a Saturday evening. That was a huge and major turnoff. How does a place that specializes in steaks run out of the most popular cut an hour after opening on a SATURDAY? Very disappointing. I, truthfully, have no complaints besides getting a better bartender and managing your inventory better. Amanda was great and a darling. We ordered pretty much everything she suggested and were pleased with it all. She checked on us accordingly without overcrowding and seemed to truly enjoy interacting with everyone. There was also a slick gentleman walking around whom I assume to be the manager checking on people as well. I appreciate that. It's a thing that most restaurants aren't doing anymore.

I am not sure why any restaurant would put such an ugly looking dessert on the menu but for some reason Chop does. The cheese cake is 2 layers, the base is a cream color, and the 2 half which is the top layer is the ugliest pink color I have ever seen.

Since the reviews were either loving it or hating it, I decided maybe the negative reviews were on a bad day. Well, we picked another bad day.First of all, the seating is horrible. There are approximately 6 booths that hold 3 adults in a C shape. They add chairs onto the tables to get 4 or 5 at these booths. This blocks the aisles and makes the place even more congested. It seems almost as if this was designed to be a bar, but they decided to add a dining room in the bar.On the other side of the \"dining room\" there are tables for 2 that are so close to each other, you might as well be dining with the table next to you. I am not into eating when the couple next to you can hear your conversation and vice versa. We had to wait for one of the booths, even though the dining room was not even half full. The other half of the room is the bar. There are no booths there, just high tables for 2 and the bar itself, which you can sit on the stools. It looks like a decent place to drink, but we were there to eat. Onto the meal....Service overall was good, even though there are many negative reviews. Our server tried, and so did the hostess. It's not their fault. Look what they're dealing with. This is a management and kitchen problem.Okay, so our waitress asked if we would like cocktails. We both ordered the Summer Harvest which tasted like syrup. It was supposedly \" good bourbon, seasonal syrup, ginger beer, and lemon. All we tasted was syrup. For $10 a pop, it should have had some effect on my brain cells.Next were the oysters Rockerfeller. They came out lukewarm. Taste was decent, but the temperature was way off.....negative stars. I didn't complain. I just don't like to send food back.The entrees came. Cowboy ribeye, medium rare. Was decent. I'm not sure if it's prime meat. It was chargrilled with nice marks on it and a hint of smokiness. However, it didn't deserve the pricetag of $38. My wife ordered the Buffalo Crossing Burger medium. I tried it because she said it wasn't that good and had come out of the kitchen cold. What it tasted like was a formerly good burger, and you know how you hate it when people press on a burger to squeeze the juice out of it while they're cooking it? That's what it tasted like...dried out meat. Sorry. I still didn't complain.Finally, I had the Scottish salmon. I ordered it med rare to medium. I told the server I hate well done salmon. Well, I got it and was really disappointed in the size of the portion. It's $22 and I got about a 5 oz. portion. \u00a0Lunch portions are usually bigger than this. I cut into it and because of it's shape, it was cooked well done on the thinner side and about medium well on the thicker side. I can't complain at this point because everything sucks. The risotto I ordered as a side literally tasted like white rice with cream poured over it. Tasteless. If you're going to put this on the menu and you have no idea how to make it, don't bother. \u00a0Get a box of Rice a Roni and charge $5 for it. It would be more palatable. I also got a side of creamed spinach. It was good and hot in a crock with melted cheese, but it was exactly what was on top of the Oysters Rockerfeller that I already ordered, so in essence, it seemed like a continuation of what I already had.We didn't do dessert. Why bother at this point?I received the bill. It was $129 before tip. I tipped 15% because again, I don't think it was the server's fault. However, I noticed the server had misunderstood me and ordered my salmon well done as it was reflected on the check. I did notice there was a lot of confusion at the kitchen window where the food comes out. I have been a server in my past life and know the look of \"hey cook, where's my.....?\" It is usually followed by bewildered looks of all the 3 cooks in plain view trying to figure out where it is or where it went, or who's going to cook this on the fly because the main entree is already on the table. This is a true and honest opinion of this place. We eat out at least 3 times a week. I am a bit picky because at this price point, I deserve to be. This place will not last unless these problems are fixed pronto. There are too many good places to eat in this town, and I would not waste my time returning.

Our server was polite but harried; he looked completely slammed even in the middle of a weekday afternoon. We began with their house salad, in which they use crispy, fried bits of pepperoni as croutons -- talk about a stroke of genius! -- but it was nothing special, and the dressing was way too sweet. We didn't finish it despite the inflated price tag.Despite these quibbles, however, there's nothing on this earth quite like their incredibly rich \"pizza\" casserole, with a buttery pastry crust, thick sauce, crispy pepperoni and an avalanche of melty cheese.

First off, service and friendliness is of great value for me when dining. Being my third time in Chicago this visit, I really wanted to show my friends a great impression of Chicago. The kind spirited, friendly, and spirited waiter won them over as he joked around and made our dining experience so much fun. Definitely big points on that. We ordered a large \"the Lou\" and it was so perfect. Service-wise not only did our waiter inform us of all the possibilities for alternative ingredients for my food allergy (traded mixed spinach which had onions in it to fresh spinach which did not have onions), but also he gave basically a show for us as he cut the pizza and served us. The Lou is excellent and gives you great tastes of veggies. Man writing about it now even makes me want to go back to Chicago just for more Lou Malnati's.

Lou's has a crispy crust, ample amount of cheese, and a large tomato chunk style sauce. I really wouldn't even consider it much of a \"sauce\", but more of a topping. Needless to say, there really isn't anything out there like it. One slice and you are full. The sausage also comes slab style across the entire pizza. I personally request and prefer their sausage pieces instead. Also, be sure to order the butter crust. It adds a great flavor! Other lesser known option that is nice is the lower-fat mozzarella cheese. I really could not tell the difference.

I ended up getting both -- a spicy tuna roll ($7) and the garlic pork spicy miso ramen ($14). The spicy tuna came in 8 pieces -- the tuna wasn't chopped tiny and there was no mayo, so +1. As for the ramen, the noodle texture were more like egg noodles (full disclosure: my guideline for ramen is Santouka). As other reviewers have noted, the spicy miso is not all that spicy (more like a layer on top of a miso) -- and the broth is not very porky, but on the plus, there were plenty of scallions and the egg was done perfectly. As for the meat, I think I would have preferred more of the spicy ground pork and less of the belly, which definitely felt out of place (probably placed in last?) and not as tender as I would have liked.My friend had a chirashi -- at $25, it was quite large -- the size of my ramen bowl -- and she had trouble finishing it. There was a good variety of fish (eyeballing it, probably 8 or 9 kinds with 2 to 3 pieces each?) and the salmon in particular looked quite fresh.The garlic pork ramen is good for folks who like lighter broths, and it hit the spot for that particularly cold day.

The hamachi was so soft, and the Chicago roll was not as memorable, but was a great try off their menu. I really, really wanted to order more nigiri, especially after tasting how fresh and soft the hamachi was. But the ramen was quite filling, and the Chicago rolls are large rolls, not your avg size. The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the kitchen split our ramen order into two bowls after learning we were planning on sharing it, but I regretted this decision. The bowls are quite small, and the noodle amount the same, so you get a lot less broth than if you were to receive it in the original bowl. Next time, I'd just ask for a side bowl, and deal with splitting it ourselves. Also, the ramen was amazingggg just wished it didn't have SO MUCH bamboo shoots.

Not really possible to split each bite, so order 2+ for a group.Chicken Thigh- $8 - really liked the buttery white beans cassoulet this is served with. Chicken was decent, with a nice crisp skin, but could have used more seasoning. I recommend this tho.Walnut salad- $8 - pretty straight up- nothing special. Solid.Feta Burrate- $8 - it was good, served with some toast. Good starter for sure- nice big ball of soft cheese for the table.Chorizo flatbread- $10 - I like the crust/dough- the pizza still didn't have a ton of character though. So- seemed like quality ingredients, made with care- not trying to do too much, which is good from one perspective, but also no home runs in our limited encounter.We didn't have any drinks, so $54 total after tip.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 12, 8]}, "54": {"description": "What a delight to have another option for \"grownup dining\" in the South Loop/Printers Row neighborhood!

The atmosphere was casual and a little loud. Service was friendly. We started with cocktails, which were strong but not that great. I'm not sure why my G&T (made with gin, limoncello, St. Germain, and tonic) had a slice of cucumber in it. Didn't make much sense to muddle the citrus/elderflower flavor a with cucumber.The menu is tapas style so we ordered a few dishes at a time. Started with the brie with bacon jam flatbread, grilled octopus, and feta burrata. The flatbread was tasty but the dough beneath the toppings lacked any crispness and got soggy. The octopus was tough but paired well with the pickled fennel and grapefruit. I liked the feta burrata because the eggplant pur\u00e9e underneath added a nice sweetness to balance out the salty cheese. Then we had the lamb meatballs, patatas bravas, Brussels sprouts (from the specials menu) and the crisp chicken thigh. I can't say I really enjoyed any of these dishes. At $9 for two meatballs, I expect a more than an under seasoned meatball in a basic tomato sauce (I was really disappointed because I love lamb). The potatoes had great texture but the saffron aioli got lost in the dish and the salsa at the bottom could have been better. The Brussels sprouts were basic and something in the dish was really bitter - maybe the charred sprout leaves or onions...not sure. The chicken thigh had the crispy skin but the dish overall lacked freshness and felt quite heavy. We decided to give dessert a chance and ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the bougatsa. Both were just okay. I would have liked the chocolate cake more if it wasn't so hard to cut into. We had to use a knife and it was still hard to cut! It's more like a dense chocolate bar but the flavor was good if you like bittersweet chocolate. Overall, Sociale was really underwhelming. Each dish was almost good but definitely missed the mark.

We go outside, sit down, and when is he ever coming back? He had handed us a menu of lunch specials which was pretty much turkey sandwich, burgers, some pizzas, and then some Chinese food on the bottom. Kinda weird, huh?

Alot of the menu items showed the pork ingredient as BERKSHIRE PORK in capitals. What is Berkshire Pork? (Ok, I just googled it.......it's a high quality pork from a rare breed from Britain)So I ordered the wonton noodle soup. My wife ordered the roast duck over rice plate.After 15 minutes, the orders came out. My wonton noodle soup (with 5 Berkshire pork wontons) was delicious. However, I don't know Berkshire pork when I taste it. It was good, though. It had a hearty serving of egg noodles, and the wontons were homemade, as well as the rich chicken broth. I hate those broths made from instant Chinese soup aka MSG broth powder from a can. This was the perfect antithesis. Ahhhh....quite the change from most Chinese restaurants of late.My wife's duck was awesome....perhaps the best I've had in many years since my Dad, who was a Chinese chef used to make that in the BBQ oven in the back of the restaurant kitchen. Most notably, the skin was really crispy, and the meat moist. It tasted like it was just made. On the side was some steamed baby bok choy and some dipping sauce which tasted like hoisin thinned out with a little rice vinegar. I was really impressed, because based on the service, I thought we had made a bad decision. Oh yeah, 10 mins after we started eating, this dude who I hadn't seen yet shows up at the table and says \"Is everything ok?\".

Getting to the the Auditorium Theatre was easy since multiple forms of Public Transit have stops around there. We ended up taking the brown line to Harold Washington Library stop and walking the 2 short blocks to the theatre. I know the red line will also drop you within a few blocks of the theatre as well. As for parking I'm not certain how it is in the area as I didn't look into it, but I do believe there are a few parking garages dedicated to the universities around there that are open evenings/weekends; DePaul, Roosevelt and Robert Morris among them. \u00a0Seeing as I had never been to this theater before I wasn't sure what to expect for the stage/building, but based on the pictures online I was sure it was going to at least be beautiful. I wasn't wrong; the stage and theater in general have been beautifully restored and preserved so much so that they still look straight out of 1889. Everything from the floors and chairs to the stage and walls all seem original. The one thing that I very much appreciated about this theatre was its size. The building is huge, so at no point while waiting in line to get in or waiting in line at the bar did I feel cramped. There is enough space for everyone to move around comfortably, even on a night with a packed house. While I did have a great experience, I would say one thing would have made it better would be better bathroom signage. Its funny that something so minuscule could be an issue, however after I saw many many people make the same mistake I did, I realized that it was an issue. In this theatre the Men's and Women's restrooms are located in different areas, however the signs at the top of the stairs down to each restroom did not completely reflect which restroom area you are entering. My Mom and I accidentally went down to the men's restroom and luckily caught ourselves before entering. And, while waiting in line for the Women's restroom during intermission I noticed that many men were making the same mistake. It was such an issue that many people were commenting on it while we were waiting in line.

There is a restoration project underway to bring features such as the mosaics and plush seats back to their former \u00a0glory. With its elegant, ornate interior, the theatre is the perfect backdrop for the Nutcracker. The staging and scenery, not to mention the dancing itself, was world-class. The acoustics were excellent, and our seats in the orchestra view afforded an unobstructed view of the musicians. I made a break for the women's room during the intermission. I was daunted at first, as the older theaters don't always have the best reputation when it comes to restroom space, but didn't have any difficulty with the line.

Then, 6 years ago today (3/29), I met a man who told me exactly what I did not want to hear.As \"they\" say, opposites attract but similarities will keep us together (ok, I improvised).

Nicole gave me all of the little backstage information that I otherwise would have missed out on, and then she let me know about a few other events that were happening prior to the actual performances, which I also would not have gotten wind of. It was a great experience, and over about 25 minutes we planned out my three tickets, and which days were the best for each dance company. I couldn't have been happier with my selection.

Even though they are about to raise the price 5 dollars for a standard cut, it is worth it. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a 20% off coupon for checking in on yelp, however. I saved a good 5 dollars off. Also they take cards! which is awesome!Interior Decor: blast from the past! Very vintage very antique. I felt as if I transported back 4 decades when I stepped inside. My father would really love it here.Service: all of the barbers are funny as ever. I was laughing the entire time during my cut. I have to admit though, It felt awesome to get a sort of celebrity treatment when I told them I was an Elite yelper. But even before this they were awesome.Cut: I received a cut from Raynie. I do believe he is either the manager or owner, at any rate...the guy is highly skilled. And should be a professional comedian. He is very personable. I mean, he literally hugged me instead of a handshake when we first met. You don't get that. He is like that crazy uncle we all have. But in a good way. I had not had a haircut in a solid month. So my head was in real bad shape. Raynie conducted reconstructive surgery on my hair (as he called it). I looked like a completely different person on the way out. It was awesome.I had to dock half a point though because in the middle of the cut he stopped to help one of the other barbers fix their broken chair. It wouldn't have been an issue except the other barber was just standing there not doing anything to help Raynie so if it was a one person job they should have just let the other barber fix it by himself and not take 10 minutes out of my cut to fix his chair.

From the very moment I walked into the door everyone, from the barbers to the clients, were extremely personable and friendly. The atmosphere will give you the impression of having been a customer for years even though it's your first time visiting. The barbershop itself is small with roughly four waiting chairs and only three barber chairs. I've had the fortunate luck of working with Raynie for the last couple of months that I've been going to Headrest. It is very hard to to find three equally skilled barbers that have great chemistry. Raynie is great because I've observed him countless times try to squeeze in a walk-in client or come into the shop earlier to fit someone into his schedule. In the past I've found it difficult to find a barbershop that was both aware and respectful of the clientele that they're serving. But the barbers at Headrest Barbershop are great at tailoring the conversation to whomever is present, whether it's a little kid getting their first haircut or a tourist visiting the city for the first time.

I could remember places like this always putting a smile on my face when I was a young boy. Glad to see Chicago is still holding it down. CHI TOWN FAVORITE!Talk about hitting the spot, this place is your dream come true. Low key with no wait for seating, we quickly ordered about half the menu without a second thought.In food measurement units - I think we ordered a boat load. The apps here are the perfect bite if your looking for a tapas style lunch (small plates). Great for sharing and trying a bunch of things while sipping on a cold brew. Our stomachs were growling since we had all skipped breakfast and clearly we went in hot and heavy. Take no prisoners!!! Round 1Slow cooked jumbo chicken wings, crispy and delicious.Smother everything in blue cheese is what I always say!Guinness braised, \u00a0Hormone free pulled pork with creamy Italian style polenta. A taste of the transitional and the new world. I could eat this everyday for a month.Big plate of Blackie's style poutine, which are like disco fair style hand cut fries. They had me at cheese & truffle oil, but the fried egg on top made my day. It's a foodie fact, everything is better with a sunny side fried egg on top. Break into the center and watch the liquid gold drizzle over the crispy french fries. My eyes teared up in pure joy after the first bite.We washed down our first round with a seasonal local brew.Clearly a local favorite from the recommendation, but did I mention all the apps were cheap, nothing was over $7. Round 2They make it very difficult to pick a sandwich with all the tasty menu options, but I went with what seamed like the most obvious choice - The Blackie's burger, which was fully loaded with melty cheese, smoked bacon, caramelized onions, mushrooms and organic greens. I personally love organic produce, which is always hard to find when your eating out and on a budget. All this was stacked on top of a hot juicy fresh Black Angus patty. The golden brioche bun was the perfect delivery system to grip my hands around. I could not have dreamed up a more yummy hamburger.WARNING: You will need another drink to wash it down, and it is very easy to get carried away when pitchers of beer are only $5.

There were 6 other patrons in the whole place. Perhaps 2 of them were eating. Not even a courtesy handshake and a card if too busy? Really?

Low key with no wait for seating, we quickly ordered about half the menu without a second thought.In food measurement units - I think we ordered a boat load.

A taste of the transitional and the new world. I could eat this everyday for a month.Big plate of Blackie's style poutine, which are like disco fair style hand cut fries. They had me at cheese & truffle oil, but the fried egg on top made my day. It's a foodie fact, everything is better with a sunny side fried egg on top. Break into the center and watch the liquid gold drizzle over the crispy french fries. My eyes teared up in pure joy after the first bite.We washed down our first round with a seasonal local brew.Clearly a local favorite from the recommendation, but did I mention all the apps were cheap, nothing was over $7. Round 2They make it very difficult to pick a sandwich with all the tasty menu options, but I went with what seamed like the most obvious choice - The Blackie's burger, which was fully loaded with melty cheese, smoked bacon, caramelized onions, mushrooms and organic greens. I personally love organic produce, which is always hard to find when your eating out and on a budget. All this was stacked on top of a hot juicy fresh Black Angus patty. The golden brioche bun was the perfect delivery system to grip my hands around. I could not have dreamed up a more yummy hamburger.WARNING: You will need another drink to wash it down, and it is very easy to get carried away when pitchers of beer are only $5.

It's been in Printer's Row for what seems like forever; long before I was born.

My mom lived in the neighborhood after college and Blackie's was one of my parents' favorite haunts when they were dating and wanted a bar away from Rush Street. Funny thing is, I like Blackie's now as much as my parents liked Blackie's in the 1980's. The salmon burger was pretty fantastic, as were the waffle fries. Really fresh, crunchy yet savory and flavorful. The portion of both is so ample, there was more than enough to gorge and have enough to take home for later or the next day. Bread is fresh and tasty, fish is moist and delicious, fries are just plain wonderful. Blackie's is one of the few places that remains fabulous and consistent and open for business.

After all this time of wondering what the hubbub was and never having had occasion to find out, I can now say I'm finally in the know. I think I can sum up this Bridgeport Coffee as follows: South Side coffee with a North Side taste and North Side price tag in a North Side type location. Translation?Great coffee in the same vein as the king of coffee - Intelligentsia. These guys sell all the usual variations of coffee drinks as well as tea drinks and apparently alcohol. I ordered some fancily brewed such-and-such, which turned out to be one great cup of coffee. It had better be for three bucks. It's somewhere in the vicinity of Intelligentsia. It will take more investigation to determine exactly where it stands.Price wise, you're looking at $2.10, $2.30 and $2.50 for the respective sizes of coffee. Of course, if you want fancy pants stuff you'll post photos of to Instagram you'll be looking at about double the price. Hipsters, if you want to hang out all day on your laptop (why?), then don't ride your bike to this place because the interior is spartan and there are only maybe three seats in the place.However, hipsters and Young Yelper, do take note Bridgeport Coffee has an outdoor alcove with probably 16-20 tables. This area will be very nice for those who hang out and drink coffee (and booze?) in the spring time, with the surrounding buildings giving it a sort of secluded, serene feel - at least for now.

Instead, the food was plated well but small for what you normally expect for a bar and not good enough quality to justify a smaller size.

The cod flavor was barely noticable, the batter was more hard than fluffy, and the fish was slightly tough and a bit dry. The parmeasean on the waffle fries was so light I could barely percieve it.The Italian Beef did not have much meat or flavor on it and was very dry (the sauce being almost necessary). The onion rings that accompanied it (only a handful even with an upcharge to get it as a side) did not have any sweetness to them.The grilled steak sandwich was pretty tough, almost like beef jerky, with a very light flavor despite grilled onions, cheese, and mushrooms being added to the sandwich. The cream of brocolli soup that came with it had a very thick consistency and lacked the pleasant texture of creaminess or earthy flavor of brocolli I would expect.The Walk of Shame was an okay burger, not as flavorful or as juicy as other similar burgers I've had in Chicago.

Unfortunately, I ran into slow service, wrong orders, and unspired food.Given the relatively high prices of food, I was expecting to see decently large portions and above average ingredients. Instead, the food was plated well but small for what you normally expect for a bar and not good enough quality to justify a smaller size. The best part of the meal was the drinks, revolution tea and south loop lager -- which is what I probably should've stuck with having instead of trying the food.I went here for brunch on Sunday and the best item I had was the breakfast burrito, with a slightly crispy tortilla and a good mix of asiago and white cheddar cheeses with the ham.The Tavern Style Fish N Chips was probably the most disappointing. The cod flavor was barely noticable, the batter was more hard than fluffy, and the fish was slightly tough and a bit dry. The parmeasean on the waffle fries was so light I could barely percieve it.The Italian Beef did not have much meat or flavor on it and was very dry (the sauce being almost necessary). The onion rings that accompanied it (only a handful even with an upcharge to get it as a side) did not have any sweetness to them.The grilled steak sandwich was pretty tough, almost like beef jerky, with a very light flavor despite grilled onions, cheese, and mushrooms being added to the sandwich. The cream of brocolli soup that came with it had a very thick consistency and lacked the pleasant texture of creaminess or earthy flavor of brocolli I would expect.The Walk of Shame was an okay burger, not as flavorful or as juicy as other similar burgers I've had in Chicago.

They were so flat, it resembled roadkill. I wasn't sure if he was making burgers, or ground beef for chili the way that flat top looked, and it was only six patties at most. If you can't handle six patties on an enormous flat top grill such as the one in this kitchen you need to find a different job, cooking is seriously not for you.If it wasn't for all the toppings they offer and stockpile on to a soggy bun, there would be NO flavor.

CHIROPRACTIC CARE - I have been seeing Dr. Patricia Zemaitis for chiropractic care over the past several months. \u00a0I initially went in for migraines. \u00a0I appreciate that she is well-read and does a great job of balancing traditional chiropractic care and new-age chiropractic care. \u00a0Her approach is whollistic and she a sincere overall concern for your well-being. \u00a0MASSAGES - I have seen both Bill Underwood and Renee and they are both great! \u00a0:-) \u00a0When booking an appointment, you may have to book a few weeks in advance - these two are always in high demand. \u00a0Bill offers a great deep tissue massage. \u00a0If you need deep tissue, you must see Bill. \u00a0Renee is equally as great and she offers a combination massage and facial. \u00a0I had this package with Renee and the facial was perfection. \u00a0My skin was amazing for days to come. \u00a0TIMING OF MASSAGES - If you are coming for a \"SPA DAY\" or Utilizing a coupon from \"GROUPON\", please, please, please ask them to book your massage around a time that will maximize your relaxtion. \u00a0If seeking relaxation, I would not recommend coming in during the busiest time of the day for a massage. \u00a0I typically come in for deep-tissue and muscle relaxation with Bill and Renee and noise levels have never been a concern - but I can not speak for everyone.PILATES - I had never taken pilates before, so having one on one sessions with Steve and Kathy was a great introduction. \u00a0With patience, I watched my body grow in strength. As opposed to pilates classes in the gym, this instruction is led with a mix of the equipment and the mat work. \u00a0 If you've never utilized the equipment, you should at least try it once - it'll give you a glimpse of what your body should be able to do on the mat. \u00a0Steve is into traditional STOTT Pilates and prides himself on teaching you about the process. \u00a0If you are looking to learn and grow, Steve is a great option. \u00a0Kathy is also great. \u00a0I saw her when I first started attending pilates. \u00a0She has a balanced tone and really listens to you as you move through the session. \u00a0 They both offer Single or Group Instruction.AMENITIES - They provide water. \u00a0There are also showers, towels, and a flat panel television in the women's bathroom. \u00a0(Can't speak on the view inside the men's bathroom). \u00a0The bathrooms are clean and pleasant. \u00a0(So Important!)OTHER CLASSES - I have not attended their group exercise classes. \u00a0I am considering joining the \"Walk to Run\" club with Bill Underwood that will meet on Saturday Mornings at 7:30am. \u00a0Currently, he has a running club that meets on Friday evenings.Interchange Medical Wellness does an excellent job of balancing the many aspects that can affect the \"Wellness\" of their clients. \u00a0 While they are not a spa, they do offer spa-like benefits without the spa-like pricing. \u00a0And as a bonus, you'll find that everyone in there is a semi fitness nut and has some information about something fitness related. \u00a0Ask a question and you'll be surprised at the wealth of knowledge you might get from anyone in there. \u00a0 :-)", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 7, 9]}, "39": {"description": "I love this place.

I cannot praise her and this Center enough. They literally have changed my life! After going to five different doctors and specialists who could not figure out what was wrong with me, I was referred to Dr. Patty, who took the time to listen, re-run tests, and administer new tests I was not even aware of and figured it out! After almost three months of constant health issues, she had the solution and I am finally feeling better. Even though she is listed under \"chiropractic\" on the website she does SO much more and is well-versed in so many different, natural, and holistic treatments from acupuncture to herbal treatments. I love that she will work with you and try to stay away from meds as much as is possible. I had never done acupuncture before, but I am now a HUGE believer having seen how my health situation has changed from Day 1 of being on this treatment path. She is HILARIOUS and always accessible via email if things come up between appointments. She is also a great educator and explains ever thing so clearly. She has basically given me my very own \"user's manual\" to my body and a lot of things I have just \"lived with\" now make sense and I know how to counteract them. I not only feel better but I feel empowered in the sense that I know what to do to avoid/fix issues. The massage therapists are AWESOME, too!

I made an appointment with the chiropractor, Dr. Amanda. \u00a0She is awesome. \u00a0In all the years of chiropractic care I've had, Dr. Amanda is one of very few who actually took into account what I was saying. \u00a0She took the time to really get to the heart of, and understand the problem (my hip) rather than just throwing me on a table pushing on my back here and there and determining that the current issue was caused by something else, somewhere else. \u00a0After a full exam and listening to Bill's assessment of the issues with my hip, leg, and back, Dr. Amanda prescribed a regiment of physical therapy with Sergio and massage therapy with Bill. \u00a0 \u00a0She LISTENS to her patients. \u00a0Pretty amazing stuff this day in age. \u00a0I started working on the flexibility issues with Sergio who is a total professional. \u00a0He seems to know just where the exact point is when there's no more stretch to give. \u00a0He is balanced in his techniques and varies the routines that we do regularly. \u00a0The best part about working with Sergio is that in addition to his strong knowledge base of the body, he knows his movies and pop culture. \u00a0No matter how much a particular stretch hurts (it's the good hurt, nothing that's easy does any good) he can distract you enough so that you can push through to the next level. \u00a0Bill's massages are the deepest deep tissue massages I have ever had. \u00a0He somehow hits trigger points that other therapists either glossed over or didn't know were there. \u00a0It's like he has sonar and can just see the knots with his eyes. \u00a0The strength in his hands in unmatched. \u00a0I know that he wants to be a therapist for a professional sports team and work on athletes, but selfishly I hope it never happens because what about me? \u00a0Seriously I can't say enough about how awesome this guy is at what he does. \u00a0I want to be clear; I have not had a relaxation massage from Bill. \u00a0He has only performed therapeutic massage focusing specifically on problem areas. \u00a0If relaxation is what you're looking for, you don't need the powerhouse that are Bill's hands.In the last 2 months since I started going to Interchange on a regular basis I have noticed decreased pain throughout my back, neck, and shoulders. \u00a0I am stronger in my core and can tell the difference in the way that my body moves as I walk. \u00a0Much of the pain I was having were a direct result of the tightness of muscles nowhere near the location of the pain. \u00a0For as crazy as that may sound, I believe the body is a whole system, not just individual parts. \u00a0I feel better than I have in a very long time and I owe much of that to Sergio, Dr. Amanda, and Bill's remarkable hands.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 2, 27]}, "21": {"description": "I've been going to Interchange for about eight months now and love it! \u00a0I purchased a Groupon, or something of the sort to try the group fitness classes. \u00a0I tried \"Hit It\" with Leslie and have been coming back every since! \u00a0It's a high intensity kickboxing workout that can be modified to your level with great music and great people. \u00a0I'm exhausted afterward, but always leave feeling like I've had a productive workout putting me one step closer to my fitness goals. \u00a0The space is contemporary and always clean. \u00a0The locker rooms and amenities are great. \u00a0The fitness room is on the smaller side, which means smaller classes, which makes makes it more personal for me. \u00a0The lady usually at the front desk is friendly and remembers my name when I come to check in. \u00a0Their online scheduling is super convenient. \u00a0They are a little pricey, but definitely manageable if you can get one of their specials or groupons and such.", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 11, 8]}, "17": {"description": "I've had a few massages in my relatively short life and this was one of the best.

CHIROPRACTIC CARE - I have been seeing Dr. Patricia Zemaitis for chiropractic care over the past several months. \u00a0I initially went in for migraines. \u00a0I appreciate that she is well-read and does a great job of balancing traditional chiropractic care and new-age chiropractic care. \u00a0Her approach is whollistic and she a sincere overall concern for your well-being. \u00a0MASSAGES - I have seen both Bill Underwood and Renee and they are both great! \u00a0:-) \u00a0When booking an appointment, you may have to book a few weeks in advance - these two are always in high demand. \u00a0Bill offers a great deep tissue massage. \u00a0If you need deep tissue, you must see Bill. \u00a0Renee is equally as great and she offers a combination massage and facial. \u00a0I had this package with Renee and the facial was perfection. \u00a0My skin was amazing for days to come. \u00a0TIMING OF MASSAGES - If you are coming for a \"SPA DAY\" or Utilizing a coupon from \"GROUPON\", please, please, please ask them to book your massage around a time that will maximize your relaxtion. \u00a0If seeking relaxation, I would not recommend coming in during the busiest time of the day for a massage. \u00a0I typically come in for deep-tissue and muscle relaxation with Bill and Renee and noise levels have never been a concern - but I can not speak for everyone.PILATES - I had never taken pilates before, so having one on one sessions with Steve and Kathy was a great introduction. \u00a0With patience, I watched my body grow in strength. As opposed to pilates classes in the gym, this instruction is led with a mix of the equipment and the mat work. \u00a0 If you've never utilized the equipment, you should at least try it once - it'll give you a glimpse of what your body should be able to do on the mat. \u00a0Steve is into traditional STOTT Pilates and prides himself on teaching you about the process. \u00a0If you are looking to learn and grow, Steve is a great option. \u00a0Kathy is also great. \u00a0I saw her when I first started attending pilates. \u00a0She has a balanced tone and really listens to you as you move through the session. \u00a0 They both offer Single or Group Instruction.AMENITIES - They provide water. \u00a0There are also showers, towels, and a flat panel television in the women's bathroom. \u00a0(Can't speak on the view inside the men's bathroom). \u00a0The bathrooms are clean and pleasant. \u00a0(So Important!)OTHER CLASSES - I have not attended their group exercise classes. \u00a0I am considering joining the \"Walk to Run\" club with Bill Underwood that will meet on Saturday Mornings at 7:30am. \u00a0Currently, he has a running club that meets on Friday evenings.Interchange Medical Wellness does an excellent job of balancing the many aspects that can affect the \"Wellness\" of their clients. \u00a0 While they are not a spa, they do offer spa-like benefits without the spa-like pricing. \u00a0And as a bonus, you'll find that everyone in there is a semi fitness nut and has some information about something fitness related. \u00a0Ask a question and you'll be surprised at the wealth of knowledge you might get from anyone in there. \u00a0 :-)", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 7, 9]}, "43": {"description": "What a great environment to work out in! \u00a0The classes are challenging enough for experienced athletes, and the instructors make them accessible for new exercisers, too. \u00a0Kathy is amazing! \u00a0The kettlebell classes will whip you right into shape. \u00a0The space is clean, light, and full of energy, and is really conducive to a holistic sense of wellness - not the typical gym, just looking for volume of members!", "rating": "5", "date": [2010, 11, 4]}, "2": {"description": "Shake that booty!

When Kathy Trainor (seriously her name!) shows the moves, I'm thinking \"Jeeze lady, I'm here to work out, not just stretch\", but when I need to replicate what she's done, I feel the burn. My girlfriend is much more advanced than I am, but we can do all the same moves so the session flows nicely. She will often do a more advanced move, or go a bit deeper, etc. I'm a total beginner and just really out of shape!

Great if eaten when warm. \u00a0Light and airy with the perfect amount of powdered sugar. \u00a0Definitely not Cafe Du Monde but a great option.Overall, very underwhelmed with the fact that they have a plethora of doughnuts to select from I was only satisfied with a few. \u00a0I am a doughnut NUT and this was sad to see so many doughnuts done so poorly. \u00a0I think Stan's does a great job with their pocket doughnuts because there is no sugar glazed involved but the rest...buyer beware that these doughnut will leave your stomach feeling sick and a sugar high that you will crash and burn from with regret later. \u00a0Your tastebuds will only taste SUGAR. \u00a0The doughnut and other complimenting flavors do not come through on many of these selections.I also have to warn those that go to this location and are in a hurry or ordering many doughnuts to watch their receipts!

I have only paid full price for a Brazilian once in my life... and that was my first wax 2 years ago. I had a good experience so I've been waxing (albeit not regularly) ever since.2. In my mind, the cost of a Brazilian has been rightsized to Groupon/YouSwoop/Living Social/Yelp rates. This means that I only go when I find a deal and read enough positive reviews about the location.3. Before today, I only had 2 locations where I would comfortably and confidently go back to again and again (provided there was a deal).4. Ms. Carla was simply amazing so I now have a 3rd location to frequent for my waxes!!So I clearly had a deal to go to Carla at LaFace and it was well worth it. When I booked she said that it would only take 20 mins (I was taking a break from work for the appointment so I was concerned). I made a face and rolled my eyes thinking that yeah right... she'll be torturing me for much longer, but no lie I was in and out within 20 mins. I was so shocked and pleasantly surprised. The studio is very small/intimate/whatever you want to call it, but the waxing room has plenty of space and light. Carla uses a chocolate wax (never heard of it), so it smells really good and helps keep your mind off of the treatment too! The process was really quick. She tells you to take deep breathes throughout and makes sure you are as comfortable as you can be. This might be TMI, but she also has the best technique I've experienced for getting your backside without you having to awkwardly and uncomfortably stay in doggy-style position. Score!My last Brazilian was amateur night (I just realized I never wrote a review!), while Carla was professional, quick and as painless as a Brazilian can be.
