I ended up getting a living social deal, and luckily this isn't one of those places where you'll have a problem trying to use a discount. Scheduling the class was a breeze, and parking was really easy as well. The Sip & Splash party was in a little art studio, and the owner and teacher, Alejandra, was adorable. We painted \"fat chef\", which seemed like it would be tough, and despite my 5th grade art skills, I actually painted something I'm happy to put on my wall! The atmosphere was really fun, and the instructions were easy to follow for artists of all skill levels. I will definitely be back.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 28]}, "1": {"description": "Alejandra and Stanton offer a great experience here. I've tried other BYOB painting classes before and found them disorganized and awkward. Sip & Splash is warm and inviting.The instructors do a good job of keeping it fun while also giving solid instruction. But you do have to listen and follow instructions. This painting isn't going to paint itself!Everyone in my group was really happy with their painting when they left, despite saying they had no talent whatsoever when they arrived.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 12, 11]}, "2": {"description": "Sip & Splash was one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time! I saw a AmazonLocal deal to do this class and asked a few girlfriends if they would be interested. We were all on board, bought the deal and booked. After doing the class, I have to say that it would without a doubt be well worth the full price, as well. If you act fast though, you can buy their deal right here on this Yelp page for $29.Booking the class, we were all a bit frightened as it was a very intricate Van Gogh painting scheduled for the date we signed up for...but it was the date that worked best for all of us. The class starts at 630 and when we arrived at 640, we were the only people there. It was insanely cold though and even though eventtually 4 other people showed up (around 7pm), not even half the people that signed up were there. Worked to our advantage though I'm sure to have more teacher time!All you have to bring is your liquor as they provide all of the paints, canvases, smocks and supplies. I love that it's BYOB as that really only adds to the fun. They provide glasses, have a wine opener, and also water. A friend of mine asked for ice and they were so sweet to bring out an entire bucket of it for us! Alejandra also let us all switch to a smaller canvas and I'm so glad we did as our paintings turned out quite well that way.As we started painting, it actually was much easier than I thought it would be thanks to Alejandra's step by step instructions. She breaks things down so well that you end up feeling like you could be an artist. You start by sketching things out a bit with a pencil and you think...this does not look good at all! But...give it some time! As you add more and more to your piece, it really starts falling into place.It's so interesting to see what different perspective everyone takes on the same painting. They encourage you to make adjustments as you see fit. If you want to switch up the colors, that's absolutely fine! I did just that adding more cool colors to my painting plus I like the more animated, thick line type of look so I painted accordingly. I'm really glad we switched to the smaller canvas because of all the work that goes into a Van Gogh as far as the dots and going back over the painting again & again to add more dimension. The class that was scheduled to be 2.5 hours ended up running nearly 4 hours!I didn't mind that the class lasted longer than scheduled at all. My friends all seemed quite exhausted by the end of it & one hoped she never saw a dot again. However, I was still full of energy & happy we spent the time perfecting our paintings. I highly recommend going to Sip & Splash as Alejandra is a great artist & teacher, plus her & her hubby are great people and fun to interact with during the class. It's a fun activity for a date night or with a group of friends and the best part is you end up with a beautiful painting at the end of the night.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 2, 4]}, "5": {"description": "My boyfriend surprised me on Saturday night to drink and paint day of the dead masks.

Ok, the variety of frosting is not as good as the cupcake boutiques (and I love me some Sugar Bliss) but this satisfies my craving for sugary sweet goodness until I can bike my fat ass to the northside or the loop.

It was a huge portion size for $6. I mean, you just can't beat that. I also ordered the chips with salsa verde and cheese. The chips were fresh and had the perfect crunch. Their salsa verde was also very tasty. The only cons I have about this place is that you can't get a cup of water, well you can with a cone sized cup so you can't put it down on the table. That was a little bothersome. The second con was that they didn't have any carnitas! I don't know why it's so difficult or if that's just not common in Chicago?

All of the aforementioned are served atop two of the place's eponymous corn tortillas, which are as far as I'm concerned, are the best available in the city. Two minor gripes on these; I'd have liked the salsa a little spicier, and the whole thing was a little messy and cumbersome (both my tacos fell apart while eating them). The tamale was absolutely perfect; succulent masa, stuffed with chicken and piquant chile verde sauce. They have like 7 other varieties available, if that doesn't sound good to you.Pricing is dirt cheap (I ate enough food to feed at least 2 people), as is the case for most Pilsen taco joints. One other minor nuisance is that they don't give cups of water; I had to buy a bottle for $1.

I stop by sometimes in the morning to grab a Red Bull before work and the man at the register always wishes me a good day and tells me not to work too hard. Main attraction is the vegan-ness, including the juice bar at the front, vegan cactus tacos, vegan groceries such as chia seed pasta, etc, and some specialty organic products. I've snagged a little container of raw shea butter for less than $2 and love to use it on my feet and dry skin now that the weather is cooling down. They offer an all you can eat taco buffet on Fridays from 12-5 for $10.99, and they usually have a coupon for it as well to get it for $7.99. I personally prefer other taco joints in the neighborhood to eat, but my vegan friend gave them the thumbs up when she was in town about a month ago. I've occasionally spotted a weird ingredient there like quail eggs (what do you DO with those?!), but they also have a butcher counter (sorry vegans), as well as regular snacks and sodas, etc. Hip little spot in a hip little neighborhood.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 10, 22]}, "18": {"description": "Organic produce, vegan taqueria/baked goods, fresh waters, juices, organic coffee and vegan prepared foods etc...

This grocery store has gone thru at least 3-4 owners since I moved to Pilsen 8 years ago. The current owners started up this past August. So, after a long cold day spent at OpenArt Pilsen, I decided to stop in and check out the place. I made a bee-line for the cafe in the back & was greeted by a very friendly cook at the counter. I inquired about their vegan menu options and was very pleased by the numerous options presented. I chose the in-house soy chorizo grilled fajitas style served on corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro. Great flavor & texture, not too greasy. I also enjoyed some okay tortilla chips served with some killer homemade salsas (one green/one red--the red salsa was my FAVE!) They were debuting a DJ tonight and it was a kickin' combo! Great food and some old school cumbia being spun from actual 7\" 45-RPMs. I was given my check and I browsed the aisles on the way to the cashier and I was very happy to see some vegan/organic items that I usually pick-up downtown were in stock so I grabbed them up and paid for dinner and groceries with the very friendly & chatty cashier. I look forward to my next trip for more vegan Mexican food and some groceries. I hope this place continues to grow & flourish.

I have been visiting this store since it opened, and my husband and I have become increasingly disappointed each time we go. They are a contradiction in that it seems their intentions are to improve our lives here in the Pilsen District, giving us the option to purchase things for which our hard earned dollar won't be shamed, and offering us healthier choices, while they are at it... All things that seem to be considerate, compassionate, and proactive. Yet the shopping experience itself is unbelievable, at best. Initially, we had hoped that this was due to them being new, and just needing to get things rolling... however, several months later, they seem to be actually more unorganised and spaced out than ever! Countless times, we have experienced evidence of either serious lack of communication between the powers that be over there, or the results of a lot of chemical abuse, it would seem. Based on individual dealings I've had with certain store keepers there, I assume more the latter, unfortunately. What they may choose to do on their own time is their business, but when it starts to affect mine, that's when I lose patience. (Don't even get me started on the goat cheese incident!) Yesterday, my husband returned from there saying he'd never return again! What he experienced at the cash register was ridiculous, and what's worse, I related with a similar experience of the same. Besides the fact that the register person didn't have the slightest clue how to add tax onto his purchase, just prior, she seemingly thought nothing of his ever abiding patience as he waited without a word of acknowledgement or apology. Their items available and what they place importance on in the area of organic, progressive, humane, etc. are hit and miss - mixed messages abound in that department! They do not, and I repeat, DO NOT make the shopping experience easy, due to this and that \u00a0they are certainly not reliable. Overall, the right hand just doesn't seem to know what the left hand is doing at this store in which we had so much hope at one time. Too many heads or too many chemically-induced heads?

Even the veggie stew is tomato-y, spicy goodness. They apparently have buffets regularly...The actual grocery store is so-so. There is a mix of inexpensive and pricey goods there.

The girls I've worked with have been sweet, but just haven't been as diligent with their work. Well perhaps that's not fair. The first time I came to get a pedicure and my technician treated my poor battered feet as if they were made of glass. I need a firm hand to remove calluses. The massage was nice but I'd rather have the callouses removed than the massage. I feel like I shouldn't have to choose. The polish was pretty and I admire that they carry zoya but polish is secondary when it's mid fall, early winter...I thought she'd removed the calluses with the tool that looks like a cheese grater (sorry for the imagery), but in two days time my heels were rougher than before...which apparently is common...with that tool...a vigorous pumice stone rub down is what I needed...sigh.The no chip manicure is what really let me down. I had a two week old no chip that had to be removed. They don't do just a polish change, you have to purchase a full no-chip manicure (every time, which seems excessive when you get it changed bi-weekly). Either way, there are all kinds of frills that I don't believe are necessary but are appreciated by some. What the tech did that unnerved me is she filed the existing polish so far that it felt hot on my nail. She was filing on top of the polish before she applied the foil and acetone, which isn't uncommon but how far she went down was painful. She brushed off my concern and assured me that what she was doing was normal. I should have stopped her there but I did not want to tell a person how to do their job. My bad. It looked fine, but chipped 2 days later. It can happen, I get that. What didn't surprise (but did disappoint) me was over the next two weeks, 8 of my 10 nails broke, split, or ripped off...you know why.

I am such a sucker for a restaurant with a fireplace, so of course when we came back for dinner I parked myself right in front of it. Our waitress was AMAZING. I'm pretty sure her name was Jenny and she was absolutely wonderful. When he was running late she put his beer on ice. She had a long list of recommendations. She seemed to know everything there was to know about the place. She was so on top of our entire meal. I'm wildly impressed with her. Oh my gosh...the food. We got an app (sausage and potatoes) and I melted. I knew the rest of the meal was basically about to be an explosion on happiness in my tastebuds.

I went to dinner here on a Friday in January with the BF. Unfortunately, we ran into problems right away. It took the server over 10 minutes to take our drink order and then it seemed as if she forgot to actually pick up and bring over the bottle of wine. The server let us know that she was the only server on staff but the place only had 4 tables with patrons so I assumed that the service would be okay. Clearly, I was wrong. We order the mozzarella and tomato app, the stuffed gnocchi with vodka sauce and the seafood special (shrimp, scallops and salmon on sauteed spinach.) The tomatoes were not ripe but I guess shame on me for ordering tomatoes in the middle of winter. The stuffed gnocchi with the vodka sauce was delicious. The seafood special was very, very dry....and what wasn't dry had no flavor. The roasted garlic with the bread was a nice touch but doesn't make up for the overpriced seafood special that was nearly inedible. To make a below average experience worse was we overhead the server telling another table that the CC machine had been broken all day and that they would need to pay in cash. This should have been something that the server told us prior to ordering. Instead, the server waited until we were done with our $90 meal. Around this time the male bartender (maybe owner or manager) came by and asked how our meal was. We told him our frustration about not being told in advance that the CC machine was down. He proceeded to tell us that it was back up again. He apologized for the miscommunication and offered us a shot of lemoncello. This was very gracious on his part and was a step in the right direction. In the process of paying the bill the server also came up and apologized but then went into a rant about not knowing and it being someone else's fault. Honestly... \u00a0I don't care who's fault it is.

With so many restaurants around ..... come on, I could make great food at home. I go out for the whole experience. So when I find a place that has great service and great food. WOW!!! what a treat. The place looks great. Just a small place in the middle of a block with a almost hidden entrance. You can't go wrong with that. Within minutes the owner came over and shook our hands and talked to us. I have experience this before (although rare) and most time the person is like a robot and just coming over because they feel they have to. Not this guy, he talked to us for a while and I asked for some recommendations on dinner. He was really nice and came over a couple times to make sure everything was good. The rest of the staff was the same, we were celebrating a couple birthdays and even the people that took our plates and filled our water was asking about our birthday and wishing as warm birthday wishes. Our server was also extremely nice and helpful. the place is small enough that they ask everyone to sing happy birthday with them. How much more friendly can you get? Again the service was great.The food is all around was delicious. We were a party of 6 and we tried a little bit of everyone's food. I ordered the chicken cacciatore, which is what the owner recommended and he was correct it was amazing, the only flaw I could see was that it didn't have any pasta. Some pasta would have been great because the sauce was amazing, and a little pasta to soak it up would have been ideal. Something to remember for next time. Also the baked rigatoni was out of this world. Seriously, I was waiting for this to be an disappointment, it is so easy to mess up but not here. The sauce was creamy and the noodles were perfect. With the sausage, mushrooms and onions WoW, I wish we could have brought some home. Now, the best for last was the homemade gnocchi. I feel sorry for my friend that ordered it, because I don't think he can ever have gnocchi again. They were pillows of heaven with the greatest vodka pasta sauce ever. No other way to describe them. At the end of the meal they come out with chocolate covered cherries, is this really necessary?..... YES!!!!! By this point in the meal I am already sold and I will coming back often but in case someone isn't sold yet boy these cherries are going to do it for you. How perfectly simple and so delicious.

As we had expected, we couldn't eat it all (they were very large portions) so our waitress packaged them up and brought it back to us along with some chocolate covered cherries.

However out waitress was horrible, it was a packed Saturday night and I can understand things get hectic but I'm sure our table wasn't the only one she was in charge of, and yet she was no where to be seen. She took our drink order and food and then brought the check, it was another waitress brought the food and drinks and checked to see if we were fine. Yesterday my boyfriend and I went back, and we were seated a table across from the one from last time and we got the same waitress.

The only fault is that the pieces were on the smallish size.Service was OK, except that it took twenty minutes, after I was done and the table cleared, to get a check. The waitress had a complete disconnect about my presence - and it was slow, there were few other customers - and was both nibbling food and taking care of some small tasks and errands.

We started out asking if their Queso Fundido had a chorizo option because that's what it usually comes with and this place serves meat too. Solid question, right? Wrong!!! Our first waitress, who appeared to be new, asked another waitress for the info who in turn gave us a sour look and snarky response. Bitch, GTFO! God forbid you're a goddamn waitress and make a living off of tips! I'm the customer, I'm asking you a question, you plaster a smile on your 1000 pound makeup caked pace and answer it like I'm the Czar of Russia. Hubby ordered Camarones a la diabla, I ordered Camarones al mojo de ajo, my little brother ordered 2 steak tacos, and our 1 year old son was ordered a kids meal which, if I remember correctly, was the chicken tenders with the fries. Can someone explain to me why it took at least 30 minutes for ANY food to come to our table when this place wasn't even half full at about 2pm? And it was the adult food that came first, you know, the seafood that usually takes longer..... So my son and brother who had ordered steak tacos and a goddamn chicken tender kids meal sat there for another 10 minutes until some other random waitress passed by and we demanded their food. My sons chicken tenders were fucking inedible and my brothers tortillas were soggy as hell probably from sitting on the counter waiting an eternity and a half for one of their idiot waitresses to snap back into reality and half ass their way to our table. Our water and soda glasses were not once refilled and we were never asked if we were doing okay or needed anything. My 1 year old ran out of water and I had to give him some of my brothers because no waitress ever came to us. A couple and their 2 daughters sat next to our table. They ordered drinks that never made it to their table and no one ever came to take their food order. They walked out when we did with 2 starving children, a bill for 2 drinks they never drank because the staff decided that the best time to prepare said drinks was as these people were prepping to leave.In conclusion, this place is a fucking joke.

I'll take their word for it, but I'd never had anything like this before. And I'm the kind of guy who will try a drop of every sauce before the food comes out just because I love trying new sauces.Whatever secrets they have are amazing. The chef and waitress kind of laugh it off as silly gringo being crazy, which to be fair, is true. But I can't implore you enough to come here for this sauce. Yes the tacos are very good.

They don't use lard! They use vegetable oil with their refried beans. Some of the other popular places in Pilsen (*cough* Nuevo Leon *cough*) even use lard with their tortilla chips.So far, I have only had their veggie tacos, rice and beans to go. When you order, be sure to say \"no cheese.\" Even though the menu says that cheese is extra, they automatically put it on the beans and tacos. They replaced my tacos for no charge when I brought them back. The woman at the register even said, \"Oh, nothing from animals, right? No cheese or sour cream.\" I said, \"Right, vegan. Nothing from animals.\"Apparently other vegans have been there before!The veggie tacos have beans, Mexican rice, shredded iceberg lettuce, minced onions, cilantro, fresh avocado and a slice of tomato in corn tortillas. The refried beans are thick! You can see bits of bean in them. Hooray for protein! Basic tacos, but satisfying and cheap, which is what I expect from a taqueria. My friend and I also got a small bag of crunchy, lightly salted tortilla chips and spicy red salsa for free. The taco dinner is $7 (three tacos, rice and beans). Individual tacos are a little under $2 each.My friend got the pastor, carne asada and fish tacos, and approved of all three.Note that I forgot to ask if the rice has any sort of chicken broth in it (sometimes Mexican and Spanish rice do), but when I was looking around for lard, I didn't see any sort of chicken broth on the shelves behind the counter.Also, personally, I have a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy with veggies being cooked on the same grill as meat. If I see it is, I don't eat it, but otherwise don't ask. Because the veggies are raw, no worry about veggie and meat cross-contamination. I don't know about the tortillas, though. The staff seem very accommodating there, however.If you're a vegan in Pilsen and looking for dinner with meat-eater friends, urge them to walk off the beaten Nuevo Leon path to Taqueria Sabor Y Sazon.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 9, 21]}, "8": {"description": "\"THEY REUSE HALF EATEN FOOD!!!!!\"\"\"Omg!!!

Well this place is kind of like those old television shows but instead it is full of fabric. And no one is there to help you as you fumble through all of the fabrics.Here is a quick guide, so you do not feel the pain I felt as we tried to shop here.1) You walk around the store looking at fabric. And there is fabric everywhere. And just when you think you have seen everything on the main floor, you discover there is a basement and a second floor. 2) When you find a fabric you want, you must act like Hercules and bring the roll down to the main desk.3) There is a line and you must wait until someone calls you. Do not go to the counter until someone calls you. The line does not start at the counter, so go back!4) Once you are called, you must bring your roll to the counter. The workers are on the right side of the counter and the customers stand on the left side of the counter.5) You tell them how many yards you want and then the worker takes your roll and goes somewhere else to cut it. At least, this is what happen for me. I did see other people getting it cut at the counter but I do not think they were ordering as much as I was.6) The worker writes you a receipt and you go to the check out counter where someone will take your money. They do take credit card too.The reason I wrote this list to follow is because between steps 4 and 5 I was standing there as a worker yelled, \"Next!\" Then another worker looked at me and said, \"That's you...is it your first time here?\" Why yes it is Captain Obvious! \u00a0So frustrating to shop here if you have never been here.I am taking off a star because this place is a mess plus there was a saw blade on one of the rolls of fabric and as I was picking out my fabric this saw dug into my leg and ripped my jeans. \u00a0Totally not cool. Luckily it did not draw blood or else I might be writing this review from the emergency room.Between Step 1 and 2, I decided to find someone who worked here and my first two attempts ended up with me asking other customers if they worked there. So embarrassing for me. On my third try I finally found a worker who filled me in on where the fabrics were for furniture.This place is intimidating. There is fabric everywhere. It is really all over the place. My favorite thing I saw here was a white suit that looked like it might have been worn by Sgt. Pepper from the Lonely Hearts Club Band. I honestly wanted to get it for a Halloween Costume but my wife had to bring me back to reality. We were looking for fabric.We also met Chester, during Step 2. Chester did not speak much English but he seemed like a nice guy. There was a pallet in front of the fabric I wanted and I as I tried to grab the fabric my jeans were sliced by the saw blade. Let's say I wasn't happy at that moment. Chester came to help me and seemed a little upset he had to grab the fabric roll for me. When I showed him the blade of death in our way he just plowed over it like it was nothing. I am sure Chester has been cut before but he will not let it stop him. Chester is fearless. I honestly wished he could understand me. I might want to have a beer with him.Long story, even longer. Fabric prices here are super crazy cheap. They range from like $4.95 to $19.95. We got our 11 yards of fabric, I put it on my shoulder and we walked out like an old fabric pro. \u00a0In fact, someone asked me on the sidewalk...\"Are the prices cheap in there?\" I said, \"Yes because I did not have the heart to tell them they were about to walk into the Fabric Zone!\" (Cue the erie music and roll the credits)", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 5, 4]}, "23": {"description": "Looking for the absolute latest in coture fabric, neatly ordered displays without a spec of dust and an excess of staff fawning over you through your selection process?

Well this place is kind of like those old television shows but instead it is full of fabric. And no one is there to help you as you fumble through all of the fabrics.Here is a quick guide, so you do not feel the pain I felt as we tried to shop here.1) You walk around the store looking at fabric. And there is fabric everywhere. And just when you think you have seen everything on the main floor, you discover there is a basement and a second floor. 2) When you find a fabric you want, you must act like Hercules and bring the roll down to the main desk.3) There is a line and you must wait until someone calls you. Do not go to the counter until someone calls you. The line does not start at the counter, so go back!4) Once you are called, you must bring your roll to the counter. The workers are on the right side of the counter and the customers stand on the left side of the counter.5) You tell them how many yards you want and then the worker takes your roll and goes somewhere else to cut it. At least, this is what happen for me. I did see other people getting it cut at the counter but I do not think they were ordering as much as I was.6) The worker writes you a receipt and you go to the check out counter where someone will take your money. They do take credit card too.The reason I wrote this list to follow is because between steps 4 and 5 I was standing there as a worker yelled, \"Next!\" Then another worker looked at me and said, \"That's you...is it your first time here?\" Why yes it is Captain Obvious! \u00a0So frustrating to shop here if you have never been here.I am taking off a star because this place is a mess plus there was a saw blade on one of the rolls of fabric and as I was picking out my fabric this saw dug into my leg and ripped my jeans. \u00a0Totally not cool. Luckily it did not draw blood or else I might be writing this review from the emergency room.Between Step 1 and 2, I decided to find someone who worked here and my first two attempts ended up with me asking other customers if they worked there. So embarrassing for me. On my third try I finally found a worker who filled me in on where the fabrics were for furniture.This place is intimidating. There is fabric everywhere. It is really all over the place. My favorite thing I saw here was a white suit that looked like it might have been worn by Sgt. Pepper from the Lonely Hearts Club Band. I honestly wanted to get it for a Halloween Costume but my wife had to bring me back to reality. We were looking for fabric.We also met Chester, during Step 2. Chester did not speak much English but he seemed like a nice guy. There was a pallet in front of the fabric I wanted and I as I tried to grab the fabric my jeans were sliced by the saw blade. Let's say I wasn't happy at that moment. Chester came to help me and seemed a little upset he had to grab the fabric roll for me. When I showed him the blade of death in our way he just plowed over it like it was nothing. I am sure Chester has been cut before but he will not let it stop him. Chester is fearless. I honestly wished he could understand me. I might want to have a beer with him.Long story, even longer. Fabric prices here are super crazy cheap. They range from like $4.95 to $19.95. We got our 11 yards of fabric, I put it on my shoulder and we walked out like an old fabric pro. \u00a0In fact, someone asked me on the sidewalk...\"Are the prices cheap in there?\" I said, \"Yes because I did not have the heart to tell them they were about to walk into the Fabric Zone!\" (Cue the erie music and roll the credits)", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 5, 4]}, "39": {"description": "I'm only giving two stars cause they are not cheap at all they do have lots of fabrics but not lot for tutus n sorry but I rather drive all the way to hobby lobby because they are way cheaper", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 9, 18]}, "37": {"description": "I've no idea how this place gets such a high rating.

I've never purchased them, but if you do need genuine leather, you should check it out as you can't get genuine leather at Joann's and Vogue only rarely seems to have any in stock (though you can likely special order it there). \u00a0I have no idea what the prices are like on the leather, though, so who knows if it's a deal.Which reminds me of another gripe: \u00a0most things aren't labeled as to what price they are, so you have to haul it up to the cutting table to find out. \u00a0And by \"find out\" I mean that whoever's cutting will scream across the room to a guy named Steve or a woman whose name I don't remember to ask them what it costs. \u00a0After a cursory glance, they'll call out a number. \u00a0That number is usually cheap, but I've definitely paid different prices for the same fabric on two different occasions, so this isn't an exact science or anything approaching it. \u00a0One good thing to know: \u00a0even if you do find a price, ask at the cutting table what the price is anyway. \u00a0You'll often get an answer that's lower than the tag you saw, and if it's higher, you can argue that it should be whatever was on the tag. \u00a0Also, their prices for upholstery foam are bananas considering that it's yellowed and stinky from being in their disgusting building. \u00a0You can find for less online including shipping, and they'll even custom cut for you at some vendors.Finally, it can get VERY crowded on Sundays, so be prepared to fight your way through other shoppers to get from room to room and to wait a long time at the cutting table. \u00a0All in all, it's a very unpleasant place to shop because of the chaos and the smells (the upstairs no joke smells like guano and the basement smells strongly of mildew), and it doesn't have much in the way of good-quality fabrics. \u00a0It gets two stars because it may meet the needs of those who do costuming, have an insatiable thirst for sequins and tacky knit prints, or want linen or leather. \u00a0Otherwise, you can easily skip this one and head to Vogue where there are plenty of deals to be had, or Fishman's if you enjoy spending tons of money on your fabrics. \u00a0Or you can sit in your non-chaotic, non-stinky home and buy online.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 4, 15]}, "12": {"description": "Solid. \u00a0I still am reserved - but it DOES have an amazing selection of things you won't find elsewhere - The prices are reasonable - 9.95 average price for upholstery is pretty good, I think.They have leather as well, something I did not know before. \u00a0my last excursion also found upholstery foam slabs upstairs - they don't do cuts, but the cost for a 24x 80(?) slab is rather reasonable considering what you'll \u00a0pay at JoAnn fabrics for the same item.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 10, 26]}, "59": {"description": "as a fiber artist who has a leaning towards 70s craft-era kitsch, this is a wet-dream come true for me. \u00a0i can easily spend $100 here per trip. \u00a0good thing im poor. \u00a0its also just around the corner from me so i can make stops here just look. \u00a0kinda fun to get high and spend an afternoon perusing the aisles...", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 1, 31]}, "21": {"description": "After a lot of searching, I finally found some fabric for two of the the projects I had on mind.

I hope you don't have to evacuate!). \u00a0However, it is a scary twilight-zone disaster area too, so it may or may not be worth it to you to visit. First: If you are a JoAnn's, Hobby Lobby, etc fabric shopper and you don't have access to a store with really good apparel fabrics--you might be ok with their apparel fabrics. \u00a0However, since I'm used to better options in Chicago for quality fabrics, like others I found many of the prints \"dated\" i.e., overly bright and floral; most of the fabrics are synthetic, although I did notice some nice linens mixed in and some wool blends. \u00a0The prices are extremely cheap on a lot if this stuff, although for nice silks--you'll pay the same price but get better selection and cleanliness at Fischmans on Desplaines Ave. \u00a0Designer closeouts, good luck finding anything awesome. \u00a0However, if you don't mind a significant amount of aging: I did find 100% wool gab and rain-resistance treated Burberry raincoat micro in the basement. \u00a0Wool gab in mostly olive, raincoats in various neutrals and red. \u00a0The bolts were still wrapped and factory tagged (thus, somewhat cleaner) and the content was clearly listed as was the date of manufacture: 2007-2008. \u00a0Result of reduced luxury good production during the financial crisis, maybe? \u00a0 \u00a0This was really the only apparel \"find\" I made here... came in looking for wool coating, but can do much better at other places in town or online. \u00a0The few coating choices, though very cheap, were very odd colors, not heavy enough, or synthetic blends. \u00a0 \u00a0If you are shopping for upholstery/drapery, that seems to be where this place shines--room after room of home dec. Again, many dated patterns, but there's so much you could find fabric for just about anything. \u00a0MUCH cheaper than other options/more selection and at least the same quality as JoAnn's if not better. \u00a0The major issue I had was the chaos factor. \u00a0Sure, ok, tossing stuff on the rack without much organization is understandable given the size... but the smell upstairs? The piles... literally, piles! of spilled ribbons knee-deep all over the basement, aisles you cannot maneuver, creaking floors sounding like they'll collapse on you, bizarre heat from the boiler, and claustrophobia-inducing low ceiling in the basement?

I didn't even buy anything because there were no prices on those extremely heavy rolls of Burberry cloth and hauling them upstairs was just too much for my overwhelmed state by then. \u00a0I may go back just for that and to take a better look at their linens, but if so it will be with a face mask, hand sanitizer, and a change of clothes in the car!", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 11, 14]}, "10": {"description": "Keep looking...you will find what you need. \u00a0Huge!!!

My experience was wonderful. I went on my birthday, which was a Monday, and we were meaning to go to another restaurant. It was a happy accident that we tried La Fontanella. Yeah, when you walk in, the configuration is a little weird. We made the best of it and sat outside enjoying the night air on their cute little patio. The owner, Jean Franco, and his wife were the only two there and they took great care of us. We started out with the tomato and mozzarella salad, which was fresh and light - they did it right for sure. We split the Jean Franco special and got a side of simple spaghetti to share. All of the food was very tasty and I have no complaints. What I liked best about this place is that it felt so good to be there. While we waited on our meal, the waitress sat down for a long time and talked to us. She chit chatted about where they were from, how they came to be here, etc. and it was so nice to just get to know her. Then, when we were done eating, the chef came out and he talked to us about where he was from, how he and his wife met, and we all got to know each other. If you aren't into that kind of thing - meeting new people and expanding your horizons - then maybe this isn't the place for you.

My parents have been to Ignotz and Bacchanalia's many times and have really enjoyed their experience. Therefore, they decided that when they found a Groupon for La Fontanella to give it a try. It was my last Saturday night dinner out with my family before flying back to LA. My sister was going to join us but ended up getting called into work. So me and my parents decided to brave the absolute horrible weather (snowing like crazy and beyond cold, it was this past weekend where Chicago is being referred to as \"Chiberia\") and drive from the suburbs to La Fontanella. When we got there, there was only one other table there besides us and it was that way all night. The owner, Franco and our waitress were the only ones in the restaurant. We told our waitress right away that we had a Groupon and gave it to her as soon as we sat down. What we did not notice is that our Groupon was for a party of four for $72 dollars worth of food. So it is our bad right there but in our defense, no one else said anything to us until it was too late and we did present the Groupon immediately upon entering. Anyway, so we order. I must say, the food was pretty disappointing. The bread they serve at the table is just cold Italian bread that you can get at any grocery store. They only offer once type of salad dressing, which is oil and balsamic. Our wine was a $30 dollar bottle that had a twist off top. We got an appetizer of mussels, which were decent. \u00a0I ordered Lobster Ravioli, my mom got an ink pasta with scallops and my dad got angel hair and clams. All of our dinners were good but nothing out of the ordinary. I really have nothing to report back on the food because it did not move me at all. So after we finished up our wine, appetizer, three entrees we were ready to order dessert. This is when our server came up to us and said that we could not use the Groupon. She explained that you needed a minimum of four people to use the $72 worth of the Groupon. The first thing I said to her was, we already ordered our whole meal and we are just learning this now, is there anyway we could still use it. She then went to get the owner, Franco, who came over and said we absolutely could not. This is when things got bad.We then said, well we have another person at home, who was supposed to be with us, what if we order a entree to go for her and then we will have four people, because if my sister did come, that is exactly how we would have ordered, just one extra dinner, everything would have stayed the same. He said no way, because Groupon says you must have four people. He then went on to explain how people will come in with these Groupons and low ball and spend just above the $72 in order for it to work. Our bill (without the dessert we still wanted and without the extra meal we were willing to order) was already $100, so I was very offended that he was basically saying we were \"these low balling people.\" We then asked again if there was anything we could do, since in our minds the Groupon was going to be used the whole time. He said no and then preceded to say \"I just cook, I do not make the rules.\" Yet, when I asked for his name later I find out he is the owner. So now he is lying to us too. So finally our waitress says that we can use our Groupon for $36 dollars because that is the deal for three people, when we paid $38 for it. Finally, after much debating they agreed to just let us use the Groupon for the value we paid, $38. However, it did not end there. After basically fighting with Franco, he was pretty mean, not going to lie, no business owner should ever be that rude to customers. He went back to the bar, and was talking about us to the only lady at the bar! WHAT! We could hear the whole thing, we literally were the only people in the restaurant now and here he is, literally complaining about us. I was so incredibly offended by this that this is when i decided that i must write this review. I am sorry but on a night when business is going to be slow, don't you think they should be thankful for any customers that they have? Instead, we are treated with complete rudeness. I get that we messed up on the Groupon but so did they. We should have been notified immediately that we could not use it, not after we were ready to leave. So instead of gaining loyal customers, which Groupon is all about, they lost three and will hopefully lose more over this review. They also lost more of our business that night because as i said we were more than willing to order another entree and we wanted dessert as well! I really hate to be so mean and cause other people to be turned off to this place but the way we were treated was just beyond me. It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

There wasn't much reason to do so, since Chicago has an infinite number of good if not great Mexican restaurants that are open until ungodly hours. Surprisingly, most restaurants in Pilsen really close fairly early -- at least those on the main 18th Street strip. So, Los Comales is the place to go if you want an easy place for solid, basic Mexican food 24 hours a day. I don't think I've ever been to the restaurant before midnight, and I probably never will. During more reasonable hours there's so much more variety nearby that it would be foolish to settle on any one place as a default option without a lot of extra research (as long as eating tons of great food counts as research at all). The food at Los Comales is perfectly good but it doesn't stand out in any way. There aren't any big surprizes on the menu. You get a decent salsa with perfectly good tortilla chips, and then a couple of other salsas in squeeze bottles (one verde and one roja) with your meal. I've had carne asada, chicken, and lengua in various forms here, and I've consistently liked the lengua the best. The carne asada is usually very salty and often a bit dry (usually these places make a big batch of it and then reheat portions as the orders come in). The chicken is okay but rather bland. But the lengua is juicy, tender, and thoroughly enjoyable as long as eating cow tongue doesn't creep you out.Otherwise, the decor of the place is nonexistent but it's clean and you're not paying for the ambience. Service is always fast and friendly. And, price-wise, it's a very good deal. I definitely recommend Los Comales as a great place for very late night food runs. You won't be disappointed. But if you're visiting Pilsen or are new to the neighborhood, I'd recommend looking up some of the truly great places serving regional specialties that you just can't get at any random Chicago late night taqueria.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 10, 11]}, "39": {"description": "This place is alright.. my experience there wasn't amazing or anything.

Don's Grill hands down focuses on quality & customer satisfaction! They don't hide behind elaborately presented dishes and the best part is that you are not paying for bells and whistles here! You get exactly what you order, nothing less and surprisingly more! You really can't beat the prices and the amount of food you get, our bill was definitely half of what my boyfriend and I would spend on a breakfast/brunch that would leave us hungry an hour or two after.

I live within walking distance from here, so hubs & I were excited to see what the Nuevo Leon owners had finally put together in this building that's been nothing the whole year-and-a-half I've been in Pilsen. We couldn't quite tell if it was open around quarter of 5 on Friday evening, but having not eaten lunch amidst the busy-ness of the day, we were ready for the early bird special. I pulled open the heavy wooden door and was immediately greeted by several staff wanting to know if I was here for the party. I'm ALWAYS here for the party, but we are not here in reference to any particular event this evening, no, if that's what you're asking. Since we were on the early side for dinner, there were only a couple of other tables being occupied and we were allowed to choose a table anywhere we liked. Settling into a high table by the open kitchen, we hung our jackets on the wall hooks provided and cracked into our from-home beverages while perusing the menu and snacking on free chips and three different salsas. We opted to share 1/2 kilo of arrachera (grilled skirt steak) served with homemade tortillas (we got a mix of corn and flour), peppers, grilled spring onions, and a side of charro beans ($16), an order of skewers (3), which we mixed with 2 shrimp and 1 chicken ($15), and a side of Mexican rice ($2). We were also given a free small cup of chicken soup as an appetizer, filled with lots of veggies and very flavorful broth. Everything we had was delicious and a great portion size for the price. The steak smelled and \u00a0tasted just like the grill, tender, and not fatty. The skewers arrived gloriously hung on what looked like a meat-bearing trident. The shrimp skewers each had 4 plump shrimp in between grilled onions and peppers, and the seasoned chicken was also juicy. I had watched kitchen staff hauling a large bin of spring onions to the grill, and was not disappointed in the grilled crunch of a well-done scallion. The beans were also spot-on, nice and creamy textured inside in a sauce with just a hint of heat for flavor, not spice. I'm extremely spicy-intolerant to the point where even black table pepper can bother my stomach when sprinkled gratuitously by well-meaning chefs, but nothing here was spiced with an intense heat, just used the flavor of the peppers to add depth, which I really appreciated as hard to come by in the Mexican cuisine. We skipped ordering official appetizers in hopes of having room left at the end since I had spotted the dessert menu, though they looked good and I'd order a queso for sure next time! We got the flan con rompope ($4) and a caramel candy made with goat's milk and pecan bits ($1.50). The candy is one wrapped piece, and if you get it I'd recommend breaking it up and sprinkling the bits over the flan for crunch, as we did. However, I'd have to say I wouldn't order the candy at the restaurant again as the next day I happened to notice Luciano's Grocery (1714 W 18th) down the street also sells these candies right by the register for 79 cents each, now that I knew what they were! Still good with the flan and glad we tried it there, though. The flan was also creamy and tasty enough to clear the plate despite how full we were ten minutes earlier. The service was great, very attentive to refilling waters, clearing empty dishes, etc. We were also pleased to have had such a delicious meal, plus plenty for leftovers, and just barely spend $40! BYOB for the win. I'm happy to see a restaurant with some different offerings from the many taquerias (no knock intended, I love cheap tacos) in the area serve something a little more upscale while staying affordable.

I figured, oh well, probably needs a new tube and good to go. I blamed this on the change of temperature. So I'm riding for a good 10 minutes or so and BANG! My tire goes flat again. Turns out the front tire was basically worn down completely and I wouldn't be the least surprised if it was the original tire from the late 70s. So I bought a new tube and tire and took it on another ride. This time, the back tire pretty much fell off... due to being 30+ years old. So at this point, I had put $50 into the bike within 3 days. I was frustrated but I figured, it's an old bike, things like this happen. Well then the next day I rode it again, and the front derailer popped off while I was switching gears. This might have been my fault, I just ripped it off and kept riding. And then no less than 15 minutes later, the front tire went flat again. The brake pads were too big and were scratching up on the tire every time I braked.At any rate, I do feel that they gave me a good deal but unless you are bike savvy and know how to fix a few things, it's not really worth the bargain.

Working Bikes is a great project that needs some front end adjustment. Eventually I stopped coming in because I didn't like the atmosphere of the shop. Saying a simple \"hello\" to some of the mechanics at the store is met with a level of rudeness that I rarely experience elsewhere in the world. It's terribly unfortunate that the bad attitudes from the employees can ruin what could be a great resource for many folks. Personally, I know of several people who have related to me stories of rude treatment there, including an english speaking friend whose native tongue is portuguese. When she asked the employee to slow down because he was speaking too quickly for her to understand, he replied by asking her what language she speaks, and when answered, told her that no one there spoke Portuguese, and turned his back on her. All he needed to do was have a little patience and repeat what he said slower.As a volunteer I was witness to sexist remarks, and although I don't believe it was intentional, rather from innocent ignorance, they make the space unfriendly at times to women who wish to be treated like an ungendered person. They sold my friend an out of true rear wheel with a bent axle from a department store mountain bike for $25 - probably 1/3rd of what the bike it came from would have been valued at.

Bought a Groupon for this place. I really didn't know what to expect. I am from Miami and recently moved here so I wasn't familiar with the Pilsen area.

Has one of those old school elevators with a door that you need to open with your hands. Cool. LOL. You then get inside and it's all artsy with the cutest decor ever!I met my extremely nice, polite, and professional nail tech, a Hispanic girl (forgot her name). She did a fabulous job!! My sister was penciled in with the owner herself. She loved her services as well. We both got no-chip manis and pedicures. The seating arrangement during the pedicure was a bit uncomfortable but the services made it worth it. Seriously one of the best salons I've been to in the 8 months I've been here.

In summary: quality work, incredible service, amazing location and relaxing atmosphere.First of all, this salon is located in a beautiful artist loft building. Don't let the look of the building or the immediate surrounding area fool you. This place is a huge 4-storied maze of art galleries and artist studios. Do yourself a favor and walk around each floor. So many beautiful paintings, installations, asymmetrical sliding metal doors, incredible lighting, graffiti-infused walls, hardwood floors.. so much flavor, character in this place... it will take your breath away. They host art shows there and other events (BM decompression party for example!). What a gem!Back to salon review. The place is very clean and organized. Very comfortable relaxed atmosphere. Erin played very well-selected lounge music, I knew most of the songs and really enjoyed it. Nice playlist! She obviously put some thought into it (or a very well-trained Pandora station? -- in which case extra respect!!)THE BEST PART of my experience today: Erin respects your \"right to remain silent\" during your visit :) I am kind of an introvert, meaning I don't usually enjoy small talk for no reason (not that I'm not friendly or sociable, just more reserved with strangers). I usually go to a spa with an expectation to RELAX, not to listen to someone's life story for 2 hours. Erin has the best intuition when it comes to conversation. I felt totally comfortable just chilling with my phone and a couple of magazines for the first part of my appointment, it didn't feel weird or strange to stay in my own thoughts, daydreaming. However, when I kind of started asking her about the building and the area a little bit, she was so pleasant and helpful! Once you indicate to her that you want to engage, she is so lovely to talk to. It is extremely important that a stylist has a feel for what the client really seeks. It is very, very rare in my experience to find someone who respects your \"privacy bubble\"!Quality of work was SUPERB! My toenails look like they're ready to take over the world! And my no-chip manicure is outstanding, I can't stop looking at my hands :) Cuticle work = PERFECTION!!!! Again, it's hard to come across someone who spends time on details like that. One word to describe the nail polish application is PRECISION. No mistakes, no \"driving on a shoulder\" so to say :)I will be definitely back.

I was super annoyed about being lost, but I've got to admit, it was a pretty neat place. The artwork was dope, and I liked the different businesses. It was a cool mixture of many different art styles. There was a recording studio, and people painting. The salon itself is cozy. The candles burning were soothing, as was the R&B music. The woman who worked on me was AMAZING. She asked me if it was hard to find the place. It totally put me at ease because I realized everyone must enter in as confused as me.

Lupita's is my new go-to for Mexican food in Pilsen. Best freshly made guacamole I've tasted since my arrival in Chicago 2 years ago. It's painted a lovely shade of blue, and the service is good, too. The food tastes fresh (chips could be a bit more tasty, but a minor issue after gooping their creamy guacamole atop) and is well seasoned. My husband had the breakfast burrito, and I had the quesadilla with carne asada. Oh, and guess what? Nobody tried to convince me I had ordered two and charge me double, imagine that?!

They keep the coffee full and are a very friendly family business and they do a very nice job. The space is air conditioned, clean, and overall a very pleasant dining experience. As for the food, breakfast is great, exactly what I want. Great deals abound in this place. Thick slices of ham and the biggest sausage links I have ever had. And for the best part of the whole experience, french toast is an option as a bread accompaniment. You may not realize this, but everyone offers pancakes or toast, and the only way you can get french toast is ala carte, and that is always overpriced, so I never end up eating french toast. At Lupita's, french toast is an option. For $7, you get 2 eggs, hash browns, 4 pieces of meat (bacon, ham, giant sausages) and toast/pancake/french toast. Very nice people, hot coffee, good food, good service, amazing value, it doesn't get better for your dollar spent. As for the lunch items, the onion rings are batter rings and pretty good.

We met with another flower vendor just so that we have room to compare but we didn't get the same feeling of excitement and relief as we did after meeting with Zenia. That was when we knew we wanted Flor del Monte.I told Zenia about my color theme and what flowers I wanted and she also added in some of her own ideas which were fantastic. My bridal bouquet was just as how i envisioned it to be, if not better. I wanted something different for my bridesmaids and instead of mini bouquets for them, I got them pomanders. They were absolutely adorable and classy looking. My bridesmaids had such fun with their pomanders while calling it their \"bowling ball\" because it was a little heavier than it looked, but it was awesome! Now I wish I got a pomander for myself just for fun :)Don't ask me why as I don't have the answer to this but my husband is nervous about pins on his clothes. It has something to do with being nervous about how the pins might accidentally poke him when he hugs people on that day. Oh well, I guess they don't call it irrational fear for nothing! At our final consultation with Zenia, when he realized that his boutonniere would have to be pinned onto his lapel, he pointed out to Zenia his concern and she suggested that instead of using pins, she would use a very strong and secure magnet that would make the boutonniere stick to his lapel. I always knew that I wanted tall centerpieces for my wedding reception (it's one of those wedding \"dreams\"... lol) and I couldn't have been happier with Zenia's work: tall vase with white hydrangeas and overflowing willow branches. In lieu of a traditional guestbook, I described to her that we wanted a wishing tree and she executed it as well.When we walked into our reception venue, I couldn't believe what a fantastic job Zenia did.

The meatsauce is also pretty bad.Other dishes like Chicken Vesuvio is nothing more than fried chicken with vesuvio sauce poured over it. The chicken did not taste fresh and was very small.The veal dishes do not taste very good, and again have that odd ball sauce. The portions of most dishes are small, which is probably the reason their entrees are cheaper than other restaurants.Other pasta dishes are just so-so. Even the Minestroni soup does not taste up to standard in the neighborhood - I would doubt it is home-made.The service is OK when the restaurant is not busy. But it really suffers if busy.My overall rating is 6 out of 10 for Italian restaurants in Chicago. You are much better off down the street, up on Taylor street, or closer to the city. In retrospect, I would much rather pay a bit more and have a much better, higher quality meal with better service elsewhere! I therefore no longer can recommend this restaurant.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 1, 8]}, "47": {"description": "I was notified that we would be joining my boyfriend's parents and their friends for dinner here last Saturday night. As I looked up the information, I was shocked to see how close it was to UIC/Taylor Street area where I used to live and that I'd never heard of this place.So I walked in with a mindset of comparing this to my favorite Italian place on Taylor Street. And I walked out feeling about 10 lbs heavier and very, very sleeper.First of all, we were there for like three hours. The service here was not slow, but I learned that it's a staple of having dinner with the in-laws that you'll be there forever. We ordered three appetizers and had them finished before we could even order our entree's. Again, not due to the restaurant but to the company we were dining with. Our waiter did not rush us and kept bringing drinks quickly.For the appetizer, we ordered the Polenta and the clams (I think raw and baked). I don't eat seafood at all or meat for the that matter. But everyone at the table seemed to enjoy the clams and I loved the polenta (though I can't compare it with any other time since I'd never had polenta before).Finally we order our entree's and I had my eye on the Gnocchi all night. I ended up having it with regular marinara sauce but kind of wish I'd gotten the gorgonzola sauce. The waiter warned that it was very strong tasting and some people did not like it too much, but oh well.I also added mushrooms to it. I had the salad and scarfed it down quickly. My boyfriend really liked his soup. The ghocchi was awesome tasting. My only regret is that I could only have a few bites and was so overwhelming full. I took the rest home and am excited to eat for lunch today.My boyfriend got the shrimp fettuccine and \u00a0loved it. I tried his mother's entree (it was either the Pasta Roger or the Mostaccioli) and wow it was awesome. It had the right amount of bread crumbs and a very flavorful sauce and cheese on it.I think everyone loved this meal. My boyfriend is Italian and very picky about his Italian food. After all, his mother is an amazing cook and even makes pasta from scratch.

I regret not getting the steak like I did before, but I tried out the spaghetti this time around and it wasn't anything special. Then again, how amazing can you make spaghetti with meat sauce?

I was born at 23d and Bell and my family had a pharmacy (at Cermak and Leavitt) from 1899 to the early 80s. I have fond memories of (now long gone) Febo's, Toscana, Fontanella and others that are all like visits to restaurant 'Central Casting' for old-school Italian eateries. This is where I had my Wonder Bread years of eating Italian. I used to think it was the definition, until I went to work for the Alfa Romeo Indy Car Team in Milano and splitting living between here and there. The taste bud renaissance I went through as I explored northern cuisine rather than central or southern (and Sicilian) versions was great fun. It made me a bit of a snob on Italian, to be honest, and the trips to Oakley or Western Ave seemed to drop off my radar. \u00a0 This past weekend was a moment to visit my roots and a visit to Il Vincinato was in order. The Open Table res worked great, even on a Saturday night res made on Friday. Nice. The wait staff and bus boys were cordial, attentive, informative. The specials were explained well and questions answered well. We chose to try the minestrone as a first course, and it was quite good and served hot, not warm. Also nice, and something I wish more restos would be more attentive about. Entree' choices were their signature home-made ravioli with veal sauce, and one of the specials: Tortellini with gorgonzola and fig in an Alfredo sauce. \u00a0Both were delicious, but the tortellini was good enough that last night (five days later) I was jones'n for it that I almost considered calling there and seeing if they were going to offer it again. Yup. That good. The ravioli were genuinely home made, not frozen or bought in as fas as I could tell, and the sauce wasn't big and gooey, but just tasty. We passed on dessert, but they looked great.If you're looking for high-zoot Italian, head for the downtown regulars I like for that kind of thing (Coco Pazzo, Spiaggia, etc) but you'll enjoy a great home-style meal at Il Vincinato. Prices were perfectly in line. Drinks weren't small and poured with a proper hand. I'm angry at myself for not visiting more often.

It overshadowed the other app, the \u00a0provoletta and roasted red pepper, which was great in its own right.Among the dinner choices were salmon, pasta Roger, and sfuffed pork chops. As it was a family event, we all shared from each other's plates. No doggy bags needed this night, as we were all good little boys and girl and cleared our plates. The MVP of these dishes was the pork chops. Because of this dish it took a bit longer to get our food from the kitchen, but after one bite we realized it was well worth the wait. Awesome. When I tried to finish the chop by picking it up by the bone I was admonished by my wife, who said I'm not allowed to eat it \"Fred Flintstone-style.\" But I digress.For dessert it was creme brulee and tiramisu. Practically licked clean.I must also mention the outstanding service. The server and server assistants were constantly tending to us. It is not a big place, so one could expect for the place to have a light support staff. But not so here.

Great choices and enough for all to try.Then an Italian salad, largest enough for the table, and served family style. The dressing could have used a little more vinegar, but that's being really picky.The main entrees consisted of the chicken vesuvio, homemade ravioli with veal stuffing, and black linguine with lobster. All excellent, three dishes more than enough for the four of us, and my favorite was the ravioli.Lastly, we had a dessert sampler - make room for dessert, you won't be sorry.

I would get this again, but I'm worried I'd be missing out on something else here.The white satin mocha was also delicious, and came with a lot of whipped cream on top. An iced mocha with white chocolate syrup is pretty much what I needed after a long ride down Halsted.The cafe was full but not crowded on a beautiful May day, so I'd highly recommend anyone looking for a unique lunch experience to stop by the Jumping Bean for a long-ish lunch hour.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 18]}, "26": {"description": "Little gem in Pilsen.

Naturally, it was the first place I thought to when I invited my Damen pink line CTA friend to brunch before her shift started. I ordered a quesadilla, & she ordered a chicken burrito. Her burrito barely had any chicken in it, but I sat there and raved on and on about my quesadilla. The chefs and owner (older, Latina) heard me from the kitchen and seemed delighted by it. So far, pretty good, right? So I go to pay while my friend visited the loo, and owner tells me I had two quesadillas. I calmly tell her I had only one. She yells back to the kitchen to ask in Spanish how many I had, and the chef holds up 2 fingers. The rest of this story gets pretty crazy. First thing she says after I say, again, \"But I only ordered one, not two,\" was (with the most smug expression and tone) \"But you *ate* two, right? And you liked them, right?\" I was flabbergasted. Since when does the seller get to do the buyer's choosing on how much buyer wants to purchase? I was so confused! She proceeded to consistently talk over me, gaining more and more combative attitude as I continued to question her decision to give me two when I'd clearly ordered one. Funny thing is, she wasn't even combatting my actual order of two vs one, but rather, the fact that because I *ate* two, I must now *pay* for two. In her head, that seemed to be how it works, regardless of what a person ordered! At some point, I had given up the belief that I had eaten only one, and my main concern was *why.* Why would she try to manipulate me this way? She speaks and understands English more than sufficiently. There was no room for misunderstanding when I ordered. She was flat-out lying to me. However, she gave herself away with her first response to my insistence that I'd only ordered one with that smug comeback. Really??!! Yes, really, because that's not all. After she finally started in on the martyr tactic \"Oh, you pay for one, keep your money, I sell to people all over the world, millionaires, rich, poor, but you keep your money, it's ok\" (as if any of this was about *me* being miserly!), and I left with my friend (still tipped 20%, mind you), my friend tells me that she had done the same thing to her friend, who happens to be somewhat developmentally delayed.

Pretentious and stingy is not a good combo. However if you're just looking to impress a date with the setting and aren't in a rush, it might be fine. Service: D-The first time I went for brunch, we waited over an hour for our food to come out. The place wasn't even full. When it arrived half the dishes were cold. We had to flag down someone for 20 min to get our check. A fun double-date brunch turned into a 3 hour ordeal...The second time, there was a wait list so we decided to wait outside in the sun, then noticed that their entire outside terrace was empty. So I went in and asked the hostess if we could possibly be seated outside. Without looking up she answered \"it's included in the wait time\". I was a little confused so I politely told her that all the tables out there were empty. She finally looked up, clearly annoyed, and yelled at me like a child \"IT'S. INCLUDED. IN. THE. WAIT. TIME\". What the heck? That's not even an explanation. My 3 guests from New York were shocked. We ended up going to cafe Jumping Bean down the street, more about that at the end.Food: CThe cocktails were tiny and my bloody mary was mostly ice. Fancy toppings don't make up for lack of drink. My chicken and waffles tasted burnt. I think they way overcooked the fig syrup. My friend got an expensive scallop special and was starving afterwards. \u00a0The other 2 dishes were fine but the portions were small too. When the check came out there was kind of an uncomfortable silence because everyone was so over it, and we still had to pay 40-50 bucks each plus tip.Conclusion: Trendiness is not an excuse for bad service and stinginess. As a resident of the neighborhood, at least I now know where I want - and don't want - to spend my money.

But, when I overheard the waitress mention that \"The Ordinary\", their version of a daily special, was quail and waffles ($15), I knew that I was going to order that instead. As a lover of fried chicken and waffles, I though that this would be a unique spin - quail, a waffle, foie gras butter, and fig syrup.Because of my aversion to soggy food, I asked for my waffle to be prepared with the sauces on the side. Of course when it came to the table, the waffle was sitting in the sauces. I returned it, only to have the same soggy waffle reappear on a different plate. Sigh... When they brought a fresh waffle out, it was dark and lacked flavor. The fried quail, however, was very well seasoned but there was very little meat.The french toast was very eggy and soggy, the \"salad\" was just a bag of field greens dumped on a plate, and things in general seemed disorganized between the servers and the kitchen, which was frustrating for us. There were mixed reviews around the table with some people really enjoying the food and with others being equally as indifferent to the food.I've had a number of great brunches in Chicago during weekend visits.

[photo #1]From there, my companion and I chose the assorted cheese tray, which included a soft sheep's milk, hard goat's milk, and blue cow's milk. \u00a0It came with a lovely hunk of foccacia and apricot mostarda, a spreadable candied fruit compote. \u00a0An excellent start, as well as a sign of even better things to come. [$13, photo #2]Then things got REALLY good. \u00a0The lobster risotto had terrific plate presentation and the flavor transcended words. \u00a0Sizeable pieces of lobster matched up nicely with uni butter, edamame, crispy black trumpets, and coral bottarga (aka salted mullet roe, and yes, I had to Google that). \u00a0The flourish of a dark green nori pur\u00e9e provided some color as well as a delightful umami explosion for your taste buds. \u00a0$19 was a small price to pay, I felt, for this exquisite dish. [photo #3]Next up was another fishy dishy, the seared scallops [$15]. \u00a0As a fancier of scallops, I know how very touchy of an item they are, as it's easy to under/overcook them. \u00a0Dusek's NAILED it. \u00a0Served with an oxtail bourguingnon, root vegetables, potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, and cheese fondue, it--much like the lobster risotto--simply defied description. [photo #4, right]Presented at the same time as the scallops were veal heart tortellini, which came with a beef broth and fried sweetbreads [$17?]. \u00a0Sumptuous doesn't even begin to describe these [photo #4, left]After seeing a table consume the stuffed pretzel [$7], I decided that I had to have it, so in a very out-of-order progression of the meal, I ate it 5th. \u00a0It was warm, filled with mild cheese, and came with a spicy beer mustard. \u00a0Had I gotten it first, then the mythical prophecy of increasingly-better plates would have been fulfilled. \u00a0As it was, though, I didn't regret ordering this one iota. [photo #5]Following this was unquestionably the highlight of the meal. \u00a0If every dish leading up to this was a 7/8/9/10 (pretzel notwithstanding), then what followed was an 11/10. \u00a0Behold the foie gras! [photo #7]It was the perfect transition from main courses to dessert, as many of the components had sweet aspects to them. \u00a0The foie gras itself was seared and delicately prepared to a tee. \u00a0The 'hot chocolate' was a small mug of cocoa accented with essence of foie gras. \u00a0The 3rd part of this dish was a delectable black pepper carrot cake with foie gras icing. \u00a0Oh holy jesus was it good. \u00a0The entire plate was garnished with roasted grape gel and black walnut crumble. \u00a0Looking back, Dusek's foie gras entry is the best dish I've ever eaten in my life. \u00a0Boom.Although I wanted to end on a high note, I pressed my luck and ordered dessert. \u00a0Okay, so I actually doubled-down and got TWO desserts. \u00a0I regret nothing.The first one was roasted chili churros [$8], served with dulce cream, candied mango, bittersweet chocolate sorbet, and a drizzle of chili lime oil. \u00a0They had a decent kick to them, and the sorbet was a great counterpoint to the inherent sweetness of the sugar-coated fried dough. [photo #6]Lastly, but not leastly, was the malted ice cream sandwich [$8]. \u00a0The item itself was good, no complaints there, but what really made it a remarkable and standout dish were the accompaniments: white coffee mousse, compressed roasted banana puree, and an astounding activated charcoal powder. \u00a0You had to eat it to believe it.

This is fine and dandy, it prevents the free loaders from buying a cookie and staying for a day, and it gives me a reason to buy another slice of their great carrot cake.However, they limit each group of two people to one wifi code per day (which they can share) and it lasts 2hrs. If La Catrina is going to implement codes I would prefer to see a similar setup with where you can get a new code every 2hrs if you continue to patron their wonderful establishment.Bottom Line: If I'm in east Pilsen this the the joint to be at but I won't go out of my way to work a place I'll have to leave after two hours, when there are plenty of free Wi-Fi joints up and down 18th.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 7, 28]}, "34": {"description": "This place is awesome!

I enjoy the community feel of the place. It is a frequent gathering place for different groups and organizations, meetings and events. And despite how busy the place is I never feel unable to concentrate or focus on work. There are three different rooms and I find that each room has its own socially accepted level of quiet.

I'm from Texas & love Mexican food and really enjoy fresh tamales & chile rellenos, both of which were highly recommended on the TV show. Unfortunately this was well below expectations for a number of reasons:My order was simple: 4 tamales w rice & beans to go. This is a tamale appetizer on their menu for $7.50. I asked for a sample of their flavors, 1 each of the cheese, sweet, beef, & bean tamales. You stand in line to order & they call you when your order is ready & you pay at that time.They also sell tamales by the dozen & when you ask for individual tamales they simply unwrap a pre-wrapped dozen of that type (kept warm in a steam tray) & put that on your plate or to-go container. The problem with this is not all of the pre-wrapped tamales are marked & you have to assume they will get the order correct. WRONG! I got 1 beef, 1 bean, 1 chicken, & 1 with a pepper in in it, no cheese or sweet. You won't know until you eat them if they are the right ones.There is a cafeteria style selection of prepared foods or you can order from the menu on the wall. They prepare meals by the order in which they are received so even though they have some food already prepared that would fill some of the orders (like mine) you still have to wait behind those in front of you who order something that might take a while to prepare. I waited about 25 minutes for a meal that could have been assembled to go in less than 5 minutes because of the orders ahead of me that had to be cooked to order. I don't know if they have had problems with orders being sent out before earlier orders in line or if they just haven't figured this out but it's very inefficient and frustrating for to-go orders.

I also had a choice of 1 pasta item and 1 entree item, and I remember thinking, \"boy, I sure will be stuffed getting a pasta AND a separate entree\"Not so much.I ordered a Gorgonzola sausage pasta and beef medallions for the entree. \u00a0They brought both of them out together on the same medium sized plate. \u00a0The Gorgonzola pasta was the only truly good thing I ate all evening, but the portion size was nominal at best. \u00a0And the beef \"medallions\"? \u00a0They were sliced about as thin as lunch meat, and were similar in quality as well. \u00a0They were also borderline cool to the touch, and also of a meager portion.Swell.We did get the tiramisu for desert, which was A-OK, but unfortunately did nothing to salvage one of the most mediocre and incredibly overpriced Italian (or otherwise) dinner's I've ever had in my life.So, I would recommend, if you're going to charge $65 per head on V-Day Eve, let those that reserved dinner at your restaurant know this ahead of time. \u00a0And, if you're going to charge $65 per head, make sure your food is worth it. \u00a0Granted, the idea of a $65 Italian dinner actually being worth it is a dubious proposition in the first place, but at least give some legit portions and better quality food. \u00a0This place gets 1 star for decent service, and 1 star for the incredibly mediocre food.Perhaps the most frustrating thing is their regular menu looked much more enticing, and I don't doubt they make good food most of the time, but the ridiculously overpriced and incredibly underwhelming prix-fixe menu will prevent us from ever giving this place another chance in the future.", "rating": "2", "date": [2016, 2, 16]}, "55": {"description": "I have a dairy and gluten allergy, so I hate eating out.

We paid $40 for a meal we waited close to 50 min for, when there was no big crowd, and that's just not okay with me.

At that moment I wasn't paying thing my friend insisted that we pay the bill and just leave. She's a really nice person. I sent them a face book post and said as a waitress you work for tips and your customer service was horrible. Well I got a response that was topical sorry and went on to say the severs repeat all the orders. Well they erased it from \u00a0Facebook so I want to let everyone now this is not cool. The food I had was not good at all. Fries are to be cooked at 300 degrees other wise they absorb the oil resulting gross soggy oily fries. You should know that and a milkshake is made with ice cream and has a thickness to it. I had to give 1 star to right this review. The manager or owner said I should have given them an opportunity to make the situation right but that was 3 strikes with the food right there. Customer service is not enforced at all.

I asked her to touch up my regrowth, which she did, but she noticed that the last person who had done my hair had left a noticeable line between the old and new color, so she masterfully used the remaining color she had to cover that up without charging me extra money. She then gave me a beautiful haircut that left my hair sleek and gorgeous without taking off too much length, and then styled it, showing me how to get really good volume (which is something my super-fine hair struggles with). I was extremely impressed with her and will definitely be going back, not just when I need to get my hair colored.

I've been coming here for the past few years. Mainly for the Choco Brazilian Wax that I'm usually happy with and when I do get mani/pedis I come here. The last couple times I've been for nail services, it just isn't the same anymore. Today, my nail tech was late. Not once did any of the staff acknowledge me waiting or give me a heads up that my nail tech would be late nor offered anything to drink. When my nail tech showed up she did apologize for being late but tried to make it seem insignificant because \"it's only 10 minutes.\"I sat the whole time listening as EVERY customer was offered something to drink & I wasn't. My nail tech even went to grab herself a cup of tea between my mani/pedi. I came in for their choco mani/pedi special that I usually get. The pedicure was just ok. The only chocolate product I received during this process was the powder in my foot bath. When it came to the mani, I'm not very happy at all. I typically do my own nails at home & this just shows why I should continue to do so. I got not one chocolate product used during my mani. I was refused a nail soak even thought the bowl was on the desk with everything but the water in it. The nail tech said they don't soak nails because the polish lasts longer without it. I'm all for tips on how to make my mani last but that's a decision they should leave to the customer. When it came time for the top coat, the nail tech went for a \"special\" polish that'll make my nails shine longer. It took FOREVER to dry! I was home for about 3 hours before I decided to take a quick nap, when I woke one hand was completely smudged! Now I just spent money on something I need to redo myself. My tech was nice & tried to drum up conversation at the end which I appreciate but wasn't very helpful. She kept reminding me not leave my shoes & coat behind and to bring my on things over to the mani table, didn't even help me out of my chair. I come to this place mainly for the chocolate aspect & that's why I specifically get the Choco services that leave me smelling like chocolate. I also expect to get what the description says I get. Today I smell like I went to any old nail salon. I've been in customer service since I can remember and at least half of the staff here can use a few classes. Needless to say, I'll be looking for another place to get my nails done, & probably even for waxes. I've looked passed their poor customer service because I liked their products, but since I don't even get that anymore there's nothing left to keep me coming back. The owner reached out to me after I posted my review & very apologetic & offered to make things right. I came back to give them that chance & Marta did a GREAT job.

Before you are placed on hold, they will say \"Thank you for calling, can you please hold, thanks.\" They do not even wait for you to respond before they put you on hold. Rude. 2. When arriving at the salon, the receptionists are not friendly at all. They barely even look at you before telling you to take a seat. 3. I made an online reservation 2 weeks before my scheduled appointment for a mani/pedi and when I went in for a brazilian and asked to confirm the time, they had no recollection of this and demanded to see the email correspondence before they would even attempt to accommodate me. 4. I went in for the above mentioned brazilian wax and they apparently undercharged me. As I was speaking with Ana to reschedule my mani/pedi the next day, she informed me of their mistake and let me know that they would be adding the amount to my next bill. um no. 5.

\u00a0This review isn't even based on only that. \u00a0It is based on that PLUS the fact that I've been here several times and never really had a decent haircut from them. \u00a0Why did I keep coming, you ask?

\u00a0Wrong! \u00a0I know, I know, I should have known better. \u00a0But it has served me in life to be generally forgiving! \u00a0To a point.I booked a photographer and a space for noon, downtown. \u00a0Several hundreds of dollars! \u00a0Days in advance, I made a 10am \u00a0appointment at CFYB online, and I received an email confirmation of my appointment. \u00a0Because I knew the timing would be tight, I washed my own hair right before the appointment. \u00a0I called at 9:45 to let them now I'd be a few minutes late. \u00a0Here's how the conversation went.Connor (the receptionist): Chocolate for your Body, can you please hold? \u00a0(This is another thing! \u00a0They ALWAYS make you hold when you call, before you can get a word in! \u00a0I've even wondered if they're just trained to do that, because it's never been busy when I've been in there).Me: Sure.Now it's 9:50Connor: Good morning, Chocolate for your body.Me: I'm going to be like 5 minutes late for my 10am appointment. \u00a0Unless it's a problem, in which case I'll come now. \u00a0I can still make it on time.Connor : I don't have you down for today, sorry.Me. \u00a0But I have an email confirmation.Connor: Please hold.This is the part that pisses me off. \u00a0I extended them the courtesy of holding several times, and it's what screwed everything up. \u00a0Now it's 9:55.Connor: I'm really sorry. \u00a0I see that you did make an appointment, and I made a mistake. \u00a0I didn't enter it into the schedule. \u00a0I'm really sorry.Me: Connor, listen to me. \u00a0I'm ready to start crying right now. \u00a0I have a photo shoot downtown today in less than 2 hours. \u00a0I really need this blow dry. \u00a0I can still come right now. \u00a0Please work with me. \u00a0I can be there in 2 minutes. \u00a0This is VERY IMPORTANT.Connor: Hold on, let me ask the stylist.Have you ever been cock-blocked from something you really, really want? \u00a0You know that horrible, sinking feeling when you first realize the cock-block is happening? \u00a0This is the feeling I'm having right now. \u00a0Now it's 10:00Connor: I'm really sorry. \u00a0There's not enough time because someone's coming in at 10:30.Me: Connor LISTEN TO ME. \u00a0I'm PISSED. \u00a0You just admitted this is your fault. \u00a0It's 10:00 now. \u00a0I keep telling you I can be there in 2 minutes. \u00a0I can be there at 10:02. \u00a0It really shouldn't take long. \u00a0My hair is washed and wet, and ready to blow dry.Connor: Hold on.Now it's 10:05Connor: I talked to the stylist and one thing I can do is call our 10:30 appointment and ask her to come later, would that work?Me: (Sinking sinking feeling.) \u00a0OkConnor calls me back at 10:10Connor: I'm really sorry, I can't reach her...Me: Connor, please help me. \u00a0I really need you to honor my appointment, which is the least you could do. \u00a0Just let me come by right now, PLEASE! \u00a0I did realize that I was yelling. \u00a0But I was standing there with wet hair, full makeup, all dressed up for my photo shoot, and perhaps the saddest look of desperation I've ever worn. \u00a0I was a hot mess.Connor: Could you hold on another second?Now it's 10:15. \u00a0I seriously think they could have styled my hair beautifully in the time it took them to sort their shit out.Connor: The stylist won't take you, I'm really sorry.Me (and now I'm PISSED): This 10:30 customer, is it Madonna? \u00a0(I really said this.) \u00a0And who is this stylist? \u00a0I can't believe this! \u00a0Can I speak to the manager?Connor: Actually the stylist is the owner's daughter, so......I hung up and styled my own hair.But you know what? \u00a0I learned 3 really valuable lessons today! 1) As a customer, I am not important to CFYB. \u00a0This is actually really valuable information. \u00a02) When you get bad, \"sorry but not that sorry\" service, move on! \u00a0I could have prevented this experience by remembering my last visit (which I won't get into); and 3) I'm much better than I thought at styling my own hair. \u00a0:-) \u00a0It turned out pretty well.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 12, 10]}, "57": {"description": "I had a groupon deal for a no chip mani.

The time was about 6 PM last Thursday. We were 3 people, my wife, I, and a toddler. My wife asked for \"camarones al ajillo\" (garlic shrimp) and water of \"jamaica\", I ordered \"cecina guerrerence\" (grilled salt-cured, air-dried beef) and plan water, and a baby soup for the child.The waiter was very polite and attentive (seems like he was new) and brought the chips and salsa. I love the warm salsa that looks like is freshly made, very simple and savory. I hate when restaurants add cumin and a lot of garlic. The camarones were good served with rice and beans. They also brought crackers with the shrimp (not sure why), the cecina came with lettuce, pico de gallo, and guacamole.The cecina beef was dry and hard compared to other times. The jamaica water was good also. The baby soup was \"chicken soup\" made with small pieces of chicken and rice, when we tasted the soup; it had a very STRONG chicken flavor. Our baby loves chicken, but when we start giving her the soup, she started making faces and refuse to it it.The baby also is a customer, one of the reasons that we take her to Manjares is that she loves fresh handmade tortillas. She ended up eating tortillas soaked in beans from my wife's plate and crackers. The other problem is that they do not serve enough tortillas; they were about 5 or 6 tortillas so we had to ask for more and we were charged $1.50 extra.But the real reason that I'm giving it one start is that I just found out that they did not pass the health inspection a few days before. The inspectors found roaches, live fruit flies, grease in ceiling vents, dirty floors, leaky sinks, dirty walls and ceilings, dirty coolers, dirty preparation tables, dirty shelves, dirty cutting boards, dirty cooking equipment even the can opener was dirty.Food is not cheap at Manjares and I'm willing to pay for good food and service, but when they do not spend the time cleaning up the place, it becomes disgusting, revolting, and repulsive. Roaches and fruit flies shows proof that Manjares is very unsanitary place; they are providing the perfect environment of dirtiness to attract roaches and fruit flies. If they do not care about cleaning the place, I wonder about their personal hygiene too. Sorry, this is my last visit till I see that they pass several health inspections and put their act together. I also notice that they did not passed the health inspection on 7/12/14 also because lack of sanitation.

I have not been here since it was Cuernavaca Restaurant. They did some remodeling making the ceiling higher (you can see the cut iron rails that supported the second floor). We were taken to a table promptly close to the bar. The menu is one plastic covered sheet and it is very simple with about two dozens of main plates, I think it had more alcohol items that food dishes.We spend a about 10 minutes deciding on our order, my wife told me that the fish tacos where good. I really wanted to know they knowledge for preparing food so I ordered the Mole Enchiladas with Chicken and a lemonade. My sweetheart adventured with a Nopal Relleno (Stuffed Cactus) and a michelada.Next to us was a table of four people who already where there when we came in. They were waiting for the server to take their food order. I notice that it was taking a long time to take orders, so when the server came to ask for the drinks, we took advantage and placed our food order.One of the servers came with glasses of ice water and....??? nothing else, no salsa, no chips, no nothing to munch while waiting for our food. With my experience as past restaurant owner, you make your customers happy with a little something to chew while savoring your drinks. Besides, I usually finish my drink faster when I'm eating hot salsa with salty chips and I usually ask for a second round of drinks. The Nopal Relleno came, the where two \"pencas de nopal\" (cactus paddles) filled with two stakes, ham, and what it looked (and tasted) like panela cheese covered with a green sauce and with no sides. It was very tasty with a rainbow of flavor and a very nice combination of rich flavors. On the other hand, the Mole Enchiladas were mediocre at best and served with rice and beans. The REAL enchiladas are dipped in sauce (in this case mole), placed on the oiled pan on one side then they are turned and filled with marinated flavor filler (in this case chicken). Then, they are rolled placed on the plate and added more condiments or sauce (in this case mole). My enchiladas looked like microwave heated tortillas filled with plane chicken, covered with mole sauce, and sprinkle with cheese and something else that I did not recognized.I love chicken, but these pieces of chicken had a very strong flavor (like wet chicken feathers) and I still can taste the overwhelming flavor. The mole was ok, needed a little more chocolate flavor for my taste and it had a little too much cinnamon. They tortillas absorbed the mole flavor on the top, but the filling and bottom were dry and just plain chicken rolled in tortilla. I had to cut and turn my tortillas to make it like chilaquiles so the mole flavor blended with chicken and tortillas. My lemonade tasted like is was made with concentrated lemon juice and the michelada was very spicy, it reminded me taste of a chilito I use to eat when I was a kid \"Chilito Tico\".The servers are nice, but clueless. In two occasions they were bringing us food orders from other tables, and I mention it again, NO CHIPS and SALSA, and no water refill. \u00a0The place is ok and you have to know where you park. There is double parking on their lot and if you park in front, they have to go and ask patrons to find who parked behind you to be able to exit their parking lot.In recap: One order of enchiladas ($12), one order of Nopales Rellenos ($14) , one michelada ($8), and one lemonade ($1.85) for a total of $ 39.17 including tax.

I'm also terrible about planning for lunches to take to work and often end up ordering out and eating foods that I know I shouldn't be eating. I had a code food for two free meals through Factor 75, so decided to give the service a try. The service seems great: healthy meals delivered to your home - just heat and eat. The meals are high in protein (I've been trying to increase my protein intake) and the calorie counts aren't too bad, so I placed my first order and hoped for the best.I had some trouble placing my order, as the meals chosen for me weren't all ones that I was interested in trying. I attempted to update my order, and I thought that my changes had gone through, but when my box arrived, it was the original meals chosen for me and not the ones I had requested.My box of food was delivered on time and was waiting for me when I arrived home from work. The meals were packaged well and contain some nutritional information (calories, fat, carbs, etc - full nutritional information was available on their website).For my first order, I received:Blueberry PancakesKale Pesto with Lemon/Garlic ChickenBeef and Bacon CasseroleGrass Fed Burger with Bacon/Tomato ChutneyButternut Squash LasagnaApple/Cashew Stuffed Chicken BreastSome things were delicious. Others...not so much. I very much enjoyed the burger and the side of sweet potato fries that came with it (I was not a fan of the bacon/tomato chutney), and the stuffed chicken was fantastic (it came with a side of brussels sprouts and carrots and mashed sweet potatoes). I was not at all a fan of the beef and bacon casserole. The lasagna was okay, but not my favorite, and the pasta for the pesto was horribly overcooked and mushy (the chicken and pesto was great, though - I ended up tossing the pasta and using the pesto covered chicken as an addition to a salad). The menu is constantly changing and updating, and I am going to try another delivery, this time choosing my meals myself (fingers crossed). There are several meals that look quite good, so I'm hoping for the best and will probably update my review once I've given it another shot.I am a little put off by the cost of the whole thing. The minimum order is five meals, so with meals costing $13.95 (breakfast options are $6.95 each) each, it isn't the most affordable service, especially with delivery costing $10 on top of the cost of the meals. I'm on a tight budget, so I don't think that Factor 75 could ever be a regular thing for me due to the cost.

I came to Nitecap for a Daycap, namely a Saturday afternoon cappuccino. The Italians wouldn't approve of this.

And don't even think of an after-the-meal cappuccino. For the love of God, haven't you already stuffed enough antipasto, pasta, veal parmesan and tiramisu into your panna cotta hole for the evening? Get an espresso and leave it at that!Then again, this is America, and we'll flout whatever traditions we want to flout on our home field, dammit. And on our home field, we're going to play football with our hands if we want to! An we're especially going to drink cappuccino after eating Chicken Vesuvio. That dish originated in Chicago. You can't even get it in the old country!In any case, the cup o' cappuccino was delicious, thanks for bringing me back to the topic at hand. The hipster that made it was an equal-opportunity espresso-puller; no hint of Italian (or hipster) coffee arrogance in his eyes. The place was pretty deserted on the late Saturday afternoon I was there, but I enjoyed it just the same. A great room: good people-watching if you sit in the window & watch 18th Street go by, and quiet tables deep inside if you want to get away from the hustle-bustle. Oh, and I should note the friendly service from the aforementioned hipster; so maybe he wasn't such a hipster after all.Then again, why is this place called \"Nitecap?\" In a hard-drinking town, especially on the south side, shouldn't that word be reserved for the last shot of likker before shuteye?

The recommendation of a Chicago born-&-raised cousin brought us to Bacchinalia. We asked for a hole in the wall, mom & pop place where the food is reminiscent of \"grandma's Italian cooking.\" All the better if grandma is in the kitchen rolling meatballs all day. We got exactly what we asked for, minus grandma. Boo.The food was pretty good. We both had gnocchi. I had the gorgonzola stuffed and she had the spinach. Both were fine but I wouldn't order them again. Not my thing. I added meatballs and those were awesome. Firm yet spongy and flavorful! The vodka sauce was really what I was after. Homemade Italian vodka sauce! I should have just asked for a bowl of that and a straw. It was perfect.Unfortunately, the service took away from the dinner and exacerbated annoying details that I would otherwise dismiss. Our waitress was friendly and personable when we saw her. The problem was we would only see her once every 20 to 30 minutes. Like from the time she sat us down, to the time we actually got our menus. And from the time when they took our plates to the time we got our check. I finally had to ask the busser to find our check. Keep in mind, this place is the size of your living room and it wasn't busy. She never checked back after we were served which is a pet peeve of mine and I believe a Server 101 basic skill.All in all, I would give our experience a C- D+. I am glad we went, but we won't be going back. If you were set on going here before you read this review, I would say still GO! The cousin raved about how great it was and she has been there many times. Perhaps we hit a bad night or perhaps you will get a different server.

There aren't a lot of bells and whistles at this place, but it does pay attention to service and put you in a nostalgic table-cloth-restaurant setting.The food here is just as good as any Italian food you'll find at some of the higher end restaurants like Spiaggia and Piccolo Sogno with less of the snobbery. The type of Italian food here is definitely more of the family style that you would find in kitchens in the north (not a big representation of Southern Italian cuisine here). There's not a lot of particularly special ingredients, but they're all fresh and so tasty. One thing that I feel this restaurant does particularly well is the sausage and peppers. It is SUCH a simple dish and surprisingly underrepresented in Italian restaurants (maybe because it feels too much like something you could make at home?).

They're great people and make fantastic food.I love the atmosphere here, it feels like an interesting mix of restaurants in Italy I've been to (darker with one large room that everyone eats in) and quintessential Chicago restaurants (also darker, with an old-timey bar and regulars who like to hang around). There aren't a lot of bells and whistles at this place, but it does pay attention to service and put you in a nostalgic table-cloth-restaurant setting.The food here is just as good as any Italian food you'll find at some of the higher end restaurants like Spiaggia and Piccolo Sogno with less of the snobbery. The type of Italian food here is definitely more of the family style that you would find in kitchens in the north (not a big representation of Southern Italian cuisine here). There's not a lot of particularly special ingredients, but they're all fresh and so tasty. One thing that I feel this restaurant does particularly well is the sausage and peppers. It is SUCH a simple dish and surprisingly underrepresented in Italian restaurants (maybe because it feels too much like something you could make at home?). It is SO good, SO nostalgic, and something I think everyone should try to get a good feel for what it's like to eat at an Italian table.I've tried a lot of other things here, too, and the pastas definitely shine as well. You can't go wrong. The service is friendly (well, the family is friendly, they will cook and serve the food and drinks to you). And everything here feels wrapped in tradition.

I alternate between eating it with chips and a spoon. Vegans beware: the salsa contains cheese. Sorry - more for me!2. Drinks: De Colores is no longer BYOB, which is kind of a shame, as their drinks are on the pricier end for this sort of place. HOWEVER their cucumber-lime margarita is amazingly fresh, and was so good virgin that I barely missed the booze, particularly at half the price.3. Food: We tend to order the Camarones ala Plancha and the Taquitos de Papa Dinner and share both entrees. The Camarones ala Plancha is hands-down the best thing on the menu. The shrimp are plump and incredibly buttery, and are served with rice and a small salad. We're not talking Mexican rice and a sad, wet iceberg lettuce \"salad\". This is some of the best rice I've had, and the salad is fresh, lightly dressed, and a nicely crisp compliment to the richness of the shrimp.The Taquitos de Papa is a fantastic vegetarian dish - four folded, rather than rolled, taquitos filled with potato and dressed with shredded vegetables and queso fresco, served with beans and the same wonderful rice.4. Service: Honestly, it could be better. We've been when it was so packed that we had to cram into tiny corner bar seats, and I've been on a Second Friday, and we've been early on a weeknight, and it's always about the same - just sort of distracted.

Didn't know this place even existed until I bought a Groupon from couple months ago and I live 3 blocks away! Decided to finally use it on an early Friday evening. It wasn't busy when my wife and I got in around 5:30pm. This place has limited seating so it got packed quickly within the hour. We started with the pica de gallo (I know I'm probably spelling this wrong) and it comes in a small bowl. It was decent.

Anyways, my wife got a steak dinner that came with salad, rice, and an enchilada. The steak was tough like you may find in many Mexican restaurants so it wasn't a big surprise.

We inadvertently visited on a Second Friday - the place was packed and the servers were slammed. Both the expediter and the server warned us that the kitchen was a little backed up and our food might take a little longer than usual. They made sure we had drinks, chips, and salsa, so we were content. And the food came in what I felt was an appropriate amount of time. It really did not seem like a long wait to me.The food was excellent - fresh, tasty, filling. You get the flavors you are looking for plus the element of surprise that an inspired chef can bring to a dish. The chips and salsa were delicious. Their salsa has a really unique flavor and has bits of hard cheese in it. My fiancee and I split a bowl of the crawfish and scallop soup - amazing! Flavorful, nice spice to balance out the cream base, not too rich. We then shared a taco plate - steak, pastor, and chorizo - and the chiles rellenos. Both were fantastic. The pastor taco (my favorite) may have been the best I've had in Pilsen, with deep flavors and a nice char on the meat. It reminded me of the pastor I've had in Mexico and Los Angeles. The steak was also tasty. I thought the chorizo, while also very good, was a little on the salty side. The chiles rellenos were fantastic. If you do not love cheese, cheese, and more cheese (as I do), you might not enjoy them. Rather than being topped with a more traditional ranchero sauce, de Colores tops theirs with a spicy cheese/cream and veggie sauce. We thought it was awesome. Plus the poblanos were perfectly prepared. I can usually give or take rice and beans, but seriously, these were worth noting! The tacos came with Spanish rice and refried beans and the chiles rellenos came with white rice and black beans. Both were insanely good! I paired all of this with a cucumber lime margarita, which was so fresh and yummy! We can't wait to go back to try brunch and to try some other menu items at dinner.I wanted to give de Colores 5 stars, especially because the food definitely deserves it. However, I think there is some room for improvement in terms of management. The service is a bit scattered, but they are all working very hard.

I do have two complaints. While the majority of the menu is gluten free, the salsa that they put on the table has flour in it. It was pretty bland with no texture so they would probably benefit from replacing it with something tastier and without flour. My other complaint is that the service was very weak.

We were so saddened when Mundial on 18th Street closed and were looking forward to having another go-to higher-end Mexican place in Pilsen. My husband and I don't eat out very often, so when we do, we look forward to having a nice meal in a comfortable atmosphere. DeColores struck out with me on both service and food, and that doesn't happen very often.SERVICE - First of all, we dined here on a Saturday, late afternoon, and there were only four other tables occupied with two servers working the room, so having to wait a while to both order and receive our food left us feeling less than enthused when we finally did receive our entrees. When we sat down, one server took our order, but later, the other sever brought our food. Not sure what happened there as both still seemed to be working the room, but seeing as how our first server pretty much disappeared after bringing our chips and salsa, I can imagine the second one was covering his ass. Also, when I commented to our first server that I really liked the salsa that came with the chips and inquired as to its ingredients, he claimed ignorance and never offered to find out. Super-secret recipe or something? I'll never know. Poor customer service skills? Absolutely.FOOD - We started off with the chips and salsa and this turned out to be my favorite dish (not a good sign.) I really loved the salsa, but never did find out what made it so good (see comment above.) I ordered the El \"Deseo\" de Abelina ($16.50) and my husband the Enchiladas de Mole ($14.50). Both came highly recommended, but for two of their signature dishes, DeColores has a lot to learn about both Mexican food and the proper way to cook chicken. My husband liked his dish, but he's says he's had better. Mine was a disaster. Not only was my portion super small for the price, but it was the driest chicken I have ever eaten in my life, and I've cooked and eaten a lot! The only good thing I can say is the sauce was tasty. I should have sent it back, but it took so long to come out I was afraid we'd be there another hour waiting for a replacement.Bottom line - Read the reviews, take a chance if you must, go with a Groupon if you can, but I don't recommend it.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 1, 27]}, "19": {"description": "I'm glad I waited nearly two years from my first visit to write this review as every time I go to DeColores, I like it even more. I'll take it from the top.1. Chips and salsa: I like salt. The chips aren't salty enough for me, but that's NO PROBLEM as the salsa is good enough to eat on its own. I alternate between eating it with chips and a spoon. Vegans beware: the salsa contains cheese. Sorry - more for me!2. Drinks: De Colores is no longer BYOB, which is kind of a shame, as their drinks are on the pricier end for this sort of place. HOWEVER their cucumber-lime margarita is amazingly fresh, and was so good virgin that I barely missed the booze, particularly at half the price.3. Food: We tend to order the Camarones ala Plancha and the Taquitos de Papa Dinner and share both entrees. The Camarones ala Plancha is hands-down the best thing on the menu. The shrimp are plump and incredibly buttery, and are served with rice and a small salad. We're not talking Mexican rice and a sad, wet iceberg lettuce \"salad\". This is some of the best rice I've had, and the salad is fresh, lightly dressed, and a nicely crisp compliment to the richness of the shrimp.The Taquitos de Papa is a fantastic vegetarian dish - four folded, rather than rolled, taquitos filled with potato and dressed with shredded vegetables and queso fresco, served with beans and the same wonderful rice.4. Service: Honestly, it could be better. We've been when it was so packed that we had to cram into tiny corner bar seats, and I've been on a Second Friday, and we've been early on a weeknight, and it's always about the same - just sort of distracted. If I could take away half a star, I probably would, but enough people have given negative ratings that I figure it'll all even out.Oh man, now I realize the danger of writing reviews of good food on my work break: it's 4pm and my mouth is watering at the thought of those shrimp.

Right now, Chef Aaron is seen hawking tacos on Taco Trip. The show's debut city was Chicago, and Sanchez did indeed visit Carnitas Uruapan.I don't have much more to add to Anthony's review other than noting that everything he writes makes these carnitas sound extra delicious. In addition, Carnitas Uruapan offers a \"value meal,\" which is a half-pound of carnitas (you can pick the cuts or ask for a sample medley), a side of chicharron, and a bottled drink (go Jarritos), all for an astoundingly low $5.99. The half-pound comes out to 4 tacos, which is more than enough for one person.You can also order by the pound or by taco. The former is a great option for group dinners and easily taken to go. The to go option also holds some appeal, as the gentleman slicing your meat up front gives you a handful of tastiness as a sample.Of note, Carnitas Uruapan is a bit of a hike on the far west end of the Pilsen, but has quickly becomes one of my favorites in the area.

And it was, by chance, one of my sophomore English students that told me to go check out the restaurant his mom owns. \"You should go on a weekend because that's when I work!\" he said--the adorable little peanut face that he is. And so a co-worker and I did a little research and found the Esquire magazine article where Bayliss lists this place as his favorite fast-food. Other famous chefs were also interviewed, naming such obvious places as Dairy Queen, In-n-Out Burger, and Burger King--(seriously Guy Fieri and Bobby Flay??) Not that there's anything wrong with chain restaurant fast food meals--God knows I love me a Daily Double from McD's--but you could sort of tell Rick Bayliss had pure comfort food in mind. I ended up going with a few other co-teachers one hot August day right before school started. It was frighteningly warm in the place--a puddle of sweat collected beneath my running shorts in the booth and I know I looked like a red-faced gringo sitting there, sipping goat consomme and choking down the deliciously spicy pickled onions and peppers. But that's all part of the experience at Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan. It feels so much more special with it's 90-degrees outside, as if you're actually eating birria at some local favorite hotspot in Mexico. I now equate the flavor of chivo with warm weather and I have yet to visit Birreria Reyes when snow is on the ground, and I wonder if that will spoil the experience. On my first visit, I ordered the traditional meal: the goat meat served with consomme. It is accompanied by lime, cilantro, onions, and then a little dish of hot, pickled onions and peppers. I made individual tacos and dunked them in the consomme before each bite. The goat meat is absolutely outstanding--there is no gaminess, no odd flavor. It is tender, with little sinews of fat interlaced to beef up the flavor and provide the right amount of juiciness. I gave my student and his mother--the owner--a hug that day and was ecstatic to find that he presented me (and my fellow teacher accompaniments) with a Mexico soccer jersey with their advertisement on the back at school the following Monday. I'd be happy ordering the same thing at this place every time I went, but my student enticed me to the other menu items. \"Would you like to try a cabeza taco?\" he asked one Saturday afternoon.Hell, yes.And there it was---all tender and flavorful without a gristly part on it. It was a heavy taco, stuffed with cabeza, but not at all runny. This wasn't a taco that with a disintegrating tortilla. No, this was a perfectly made cabeza taco with onion and cilantro. I told him how good it was. \"That's because I made it,\" he beamed and brought me out a few samples of Mexican candy and some fresh pineapple juice. I've come to the conclusion that birria in Chicago is like what the \"world's greatest cup of coffee\" is in New York. There are hundreds of places that claim they've got the best there is--even several right in the same neighborhood as Birreria Reyes. And to tell you the truth, they are probably some amazing ones, but to me, it is this place right in the heart of Pilsen that offers everything: great food, great experience, and great people.", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 7, 26]}, "24": {"description": "The birria is delicious!

Next time, I'll take full advantage of this rich, spicy, and unique blend of flavors.(3) The cabeza tacos are unbelievable. They're tender, flavorful, and a must-try item.(4) Oh yeah, it's a birreria, right? Lots of goat. Actually, pretty much all goat. And it's very good.(5) This is a great place for sharing. Order the large goat plate (basically a large bowl of stewed goat meat in broth) and a few tacos. You will not be disappointed. (6) If you're not feeling too hungry then try a bowl of the goat consomm\u00e9 and a taco on the side. On a chilly day, this is a perfect lunch.Otherwise, just enjoy.

This past mother's day weekend I decided to take my Tejano mother to eat one of her favorite meals at this quaint little birria joint in Pilsen. Let's start with the service, they were quick to attend to their customers, friendly and very hospitable indeed. When I walked in the door, I didn't even have to look at a menu, my mind was focused on one thing and one thing only, rolling up my sleeves, putting the napkin on my lap, opening up my can of soda and getting ready to just dig in. The aromas of birria steam danced circles around me, seducing all of my senses. \u00a0I went right to ordering one pound of birria to share, which is a very nice & plentiful order to share. All of the add ons accompanied the one pound of meat...a nice plate of cilantro, onions, and limes. Each of us also received a nice steamy bowl of their very tasty consomme and over a dozen of hot and ready tortillas de maiz. The meat was tender, it almost melted in my mouth. I made myself a few tacos with all the condiments and dipped each bite into the consomme and not once did I mind that the juices of the meat ran down my arms and sleeves. And that tasty bowl of consomme, was good to the last drop, I had absolutely no shame in pickin' up that bowl and drinking it until the last drop of it went into my mouth. :) Like I said, I knew when I walked into this place, I was ready to do some serious birria-eating business. For just about twenty dollars, we both ate a meal that was fit for a king. I'm going to say that the name REYES (meaning \"kings\") might be the name of the family that owns this little hot spot, but REYES could also define that this birria itself has a definite ROYAL quality of impeccable flavor. All I can say is that if the American guru of Mexican cuisine, Rick Bayless gave this place some major props, then *you* know it is thee place to eat! I can't wait to go back!

Their menu is simple (basically goat and a few types of tacos), but there were definitely some items that were new to me (cows head, goat liver, tongue). I opted for 2 tacos and I'm glad I did two instead of three because these were quite filling. I got the chiva (goat) and cabeza (cows head). Let's talk about the cows head first. This taco is filled with various parts of the cow's tender head meat (brains, cheek, eyes, tongue), but if no one told you what you were eating you would just think it's the tenderest, juiciest beef taco you've ever had. If you can get past the idea of what you are eating, or at least convince yourself that it's something else, then you are in for a treat. The goat taco was also pretty good, but I've had goat a lot before so this wasn't as new and exciting as the cabeza. These tacos were packed full or flavor and were the type that needed two tortillas. I paid about $6 for the two tacos and a horchata - not a bad deal at all.

Actually, it was probably one of the best mojitos I've ever had. To start, we ordered guacamole, queso fundido, Caesar salad, truffle mac 'n' cheese, and a couple of other plates. As a main dish, I split the shrimp pasta with a colleague. Holy guacamole, everything was beyond delicious. How does a place like this have the best truffle mac 'n' cheese I've ever tasted?! I don't even know. I don't have a complex palette or array of descriptive words that foodies use to describe their culinary experiences, but let me just tell you: the food at this place is damn tasty. And the service was great, too. I ended up taking the shrimp pasta to go and gave it to my dad to reheat for his lunch the next day. He, like me, doesn't really like Latin foods, and was super hesitant about the dish. But that day, I received a text message from him telling me it was delicious. Who knew?

Just seemed odd.We ordered the brie and pear quesadilla, which was pretty good, and the guacamole.

I kind of suspected it and then finally got a chip that might have sat out a little long and that burst of bitter oil flavor was pretty unpleasant.For dinner, I had a small ribeye, which came out thin and nicely cooked, with good beef flavor, but it was unfortunately very over salted. It's kind of tough to get a steak oversalted for me, but this succeeded, perhaps owing to its thin-ness. Other diners had petite filets, which were inexplicably cut in to very small pieces. Not quite medallions, but small chunks that were then also over-seasoned and a little improperly cooked.I just wanted better.

Lastly but especially not least, if you're on a budget and have a huge appetite, DO NOT SNOOZE on the 10am-3:30pm BUFFET. Offering pork, chicken, pozole, mole, rice, beans, an assortment of fresh vegetables for a salad and a wide selection of chopped fresh fruit, it's a great deal. If you're lucky, they'll even have a pot of steaming arroz con leche to have before you dig into the appetizing pozole or mole. They also usually have a selection of delicious sauces. Some of them creme based, such as a pastal orange-colored, creme based sauce that has a hint of crushed chipotle and lime. IT'S SO GOOD. OH, did I mention they're BYOB?So, after all the positive, there's gotta be a downside, right? Well, I tend to look at it this way: Don't go to Fogata if you're in a rush. Go there if you want to sit down in an intimate, warm setting with friends or your partner to enjoy each bite and sip your wine or beer. What I'm sayin is, the waiters aren't in a rush. They sometimes forget what you asked them to bring, such as extra silverware or glasses for your wine. But if you just ask them again, they gladly bring the items to you. It's just real lax there, ya know? oh, and they have kareoke and live music....kareoke whenever you want! and it's all mexican songs, baby.

So I went last week (late september) and Angel was there with another artist Aron. now everyone who compliments angel, compliments them on his creativeness, but I was also looking for someone who would appreciate that am there and and is not a douchebag. Angel is just one of those typical artists, that think they are above people. He did not welcome me, just ignored me. and all he did after 5 minutes of talking to the other artist was look at me and point at the other artist. I was going to leave and say \"screw this guy\" but the other artist Aron was awesome. I saw his work and he sold me with this arm tattoo he did with someone in black and white and i was sold. He was also very excited to do my tattoo! He didn't think he was above anyone else he was digging my design and just had tons of respect. Every other artist that worked that day was very friendly and complimented my the tattoo, silva just walked around like a douchebag, like he doesn't care because at the end of the day he is getting profit. Aron was patient and always asked permission on the shading. He also was thankful for me coming in and letting him tattoo me.

Well for starters, WE (my girlfriend & I) NEVER GOT OUR FOOD! That's right, this isn't your garden variety bad Yelp review based on mismatched palate or poor service experience. No, this was a classic case of Murphy's law!We arrived around 1020pm on a Friday night, mind you they close at midnight. We submitted our order with our waitress, who didn't come off as exceptionally horrible at first, within 5 minutes of arriving.The ambiance of a summer night on the patio with a live DJ spinning classic hip-hop on straight vinyl (no Serato) must have made us lose track of time, because before we knew it, we were 45 minutes into our wait with no sign or return from our waitress!Admittedly, I'm a little coy about being the \"complain-y\" type, but since I saw everyone else being served AND we were coming up on what would be considered \"last call\", I knew something had to be said. I finally spotted our waitress and asked if food orders typically took this long ONLY TO HAVE HER DENY THAT SHE WAS OUR WAITRESS! I'd be lying if I didn't say my blood started to boil just a little bit, but I decided to keep my composure. The waitress took our order again but then walked away as quickly as possible almost as if to suggest that she could care less. IF LOOKS COULD KILL!As you might understand, we were plenty upset at this point. Things took a turn for the worst when she returned with bottles of Sriracha ketchup in her hands asking if we had ordered the turkey burger. We hadn't. This was the last straw!We stood up and decided we'd had enough. On our way out we asked to speak with a manager. We got one better, Frank (principal/co-owner) was standing there to hear our concern.Progress/problem solved right? Nope!We aired our grievance with Frank in front of our waitress and, would you believe it, she pointed at another waitress who had her back turned and blamed her!To make matters worse, Frank was somewhat nonchalant and borderline condescending through the entire ordeal.He offered us his business card (will add photo for proof) and our next dinner on him BUT NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED OR MADE ANY SEMBLANCE OF AN EFFORT TO TRULY RECTIFY THE MATTER! He didn't even offer to make sure our food was brought out immediately!Beyond disappointed!

He definitely is extremely passionate about his menu and place which was great to see. Very authentic guy to say the least. So we ended up trying the buffalo shrimp for an app which were delicious and very spicy!

Found out about it through the \"Chicago's Best\" YouTube channel and instantly bookmarked it in my Yelp app.I'm such a dedicated Foodie that I drove 40 minutes from Rogers Park to experience what looked to be promising in the \"Diez y Ocho\" burger. \u00a0So what went wrong? Well for starters, WE (my girlfriend & I) NEVER GOT OUR FOOD! That's right, this isn't your garden variety bad Yelp review based on mismatched palate or poor service experience. No, this was a classic case of Murphy's law!We arrived around 1020pm on a Friday night, mind you they close at midnight. We submitted our order with our waitress, who didn't come off as exceptionally horrible at first, within 5 minutes of arriving.The ambiance of a summer night on the patio with a live DJ spinning classic hip-hop on straight vinyl (no Serato) must have made us lose track of time, because before we knew it, we were 45 minutes into our wait with no sign or return from our waitress!Admittedly, I'm a little coy about being the \"complain-y\" type, but since I saw everyone else being served AND we were coming up on what would be considered \"last call\", I knew something had to be said. I finally spotted our waitress and asked if food orders typically took this long ONLY TO HAVE HER DENY THAT SHE WAS OUR WAITRESS! I'd be lying if I didn't say my blood started to boil just a little bit, but I decided to keep my composure. The waitress took our order again but then walked away as quickly as possible almost as if to suggest that she could care less. IF LOOKS COULD KILL!As you might understand, we were plenty upset at this point. Things took a turn for the worst when she returned with bottles of Sriracha ketchup in her hands asking if we had ordered the turkey burger. We hadn't. This was the last straw!We stood up and decided we'd had enough. On our way out we asked to speak with a manager. We got one better, Frank (principal/co-owner) was standing there to hear our concern.Progress/problem solved right? Nope!We aired our grievance with Frank in front of our waitress and, would you believe it, she pointed at another waitress who had her back turned and blamed her!To make matters worse, Frank was somewhat nonchalant and borderline condescending through the entire ordeal.He offered us his business card (will add photo for proof) and our next dinner on him BUT NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED OR MADE ANY SEMBLANCE OF AN EFFORT TO TRULY RECTIFY THE MATTER! He didn't even offer to make sure our food was brought out immediately!Beyond disappointed! Downright, APPALLED!UPDATE: To be fair, Frank messaged me on here the morning after posting my review to extend the olive branch. He apologized and offered to have us back as his guests to mend matters.

But I attribute that to the amount of people in the store. I also wasn't offered any wine/beer---but that may be a good thing, since I did enough damage in a completely *sober* state. I found the prices to be a bit pricey on most items---but I guess I am paying for them to shop for me. Overall, most of the selection just wasn't my style.

HOWEVER----Knee Deep has a pretty good shoe selection AND travel bag collection...and cool sunglasses. The boots are cool. I wish I were able to find more suitable handbags, though.

Personally, I think it's kinda cool, eating and drinking at the same time. Casa may import from Mexico, but guess what, Mexico imports from the world. I found pickled mussels, also Goya, imported from Spain for $3.99!!! No MSG or any additives just mussels, vinegar and herbs. Phenomenal! When in season the $1 pomegranates are superb. Naturally as with any other fruit you have to pick nicely ripe ones or let them ripen. MEAT! The beef stew cubes or just steak cuts are amazing.

First of all, despite what many have claimed about Honky Tonk, I find the place to be rather grimy. Grease seems to linger in the air and when combined with unwashed floor grit, the whole restaurant feels stuffy and out-dated. Oddly, some people seem to care for this feel, I do not. Not in a place that serves food. I've tried several of their meats; I am unimpressed to say the least. Honky Tonk cold smokes their meats and oddly enough, serves the food cold. Like day old, stagnant, luke warm. Anyone that knows anything about true barbecue, knows that good barbecue does not need \"barbecue sauce.\" I have observed the majority of paying customers in this joint smothering their chicken and pulled pork sandwiches with barbecue sauce... And laughing, carrying on with their day. Shameful. Their prices are beyond ludicrous for their sub-par cooking-- 7$ for seven SLICES of fried tomatoes!! Ha! Just... Awful. Anyways, I did enjoy the bands \u00a0and ensembles that came through during my visits, and the guys behind the bar are great... Just not great enough for me to return. Ever. If you want decent barbecue try County BBQ, off Taylor street. That place gives you more bang for you buck with good food and less plaid shirts... Oh God, the sea of plaid shirts at Honky Tonk...

It's so worth it!Upon entering we were greeted and quickly seated with no problem! Our drink orders taken and shortly after receiving the men were ready to order their meat platter! More than enough for two growing men!!! I went with the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Mac & Cheese, more than enough for little me!Everything was perfect! You'd expect to wait forever for your food but that's not the case when it comes to Honky Tonk! They really make it a point to keep their customers happy and most importantly fed! We waited no more than 10 minutes and everything came out fresh and tasty! We were very pleased with everything and our special guest enjoyed the food and entertainment! Definitely a highlight of his visit and we are surely going to bring him back the next time he visits. I should mention that being a VEGETARIAN, Yes that's right, I absolutely love this place! The fact that there are options for me is huge! Come in for the BBQ and definitely make it a point to try their sides, you will not be disappointed. The fact that Honky Tonk keeps me well fed and satisfied says a lot! Hard to believe a Vegetarian loving a BBQ joint, it's possible and especially when it comes to Honky Tonk. Check it out, groups, intimate date night... expect to enjoy yourselves and leave with a full and satisfied belly!

After a long and humid day, we were ready to end the night with a nice dinner.I used an app that finds restaurants that were featured on the Food Network and found Honky Tonk BBQ. After a longish bus ride from Willis Tower, we made it to the neighborhood. It's located in what seems to be an up and coming area. As we walked toward the restaurant, we were beckoned by the sound of live 1920s jazz music. The door was propped open and we could hear that a good time was to be had inside.We entered the bar which was packed and very loud with the music and customers. The bar is smallish with very loud acoustics. The large sound system could have definitely been turned down by 20%. Aside from the noise, the ambiance was excellent and very cool. The band was great. The bar was dimly lit, full of random photos and oil paintings, and a beautiful old wooden bar. Unfortunately, it was also swelteringly hot inside. It appeared that the bar was being cooled by window unit air conditioners that were clearly inadequate for the room. Everyone I saw in the bar, ourselves included, was noticeably sweaty.We were unable to find any staff initially but knew we wanted to stay despite the heat and noise. This was an authentically cool Chicago bar.Eventually we sat ourselves at an unbussed table and a friendly waitress later came to clear the table and serve us. We both ordered pulled pork sandwiches and an order of the garlic mashed potatoes. My girlfriend ordered a gin and tonic. When the food arrived we were very pleasantly surprised. While many other pulled pork sandwiches served at other restaurants tend to be greasy, runny, and sloppy to eat, this one was nice and tender but dry; perfect to add their house made BBQ sauce. They had both a sweet and tangy barbecue sauce. Both were excellent. I preferred the tangy even though I'm generally averse to spicy foods and sauces. The girlfriend enjoyed her G and T's though they were slow to be refilled. The garlic mashed potatoes were not runny like some restaurant mashed potatoes and they appeared to be made from scratch.We both thought the meal was delicious and particularly enjoyed their sauces.Even with the oppressive heat and loud noise and so-so service, the food and ambiance were both so great that we will definitely be back next time we're in town.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 28]}, "51": {"description": "The restaurant is conveniently located in Pilsen and is easy to reach.

The beau and I dined here on an extremely cold and rainy Tuesday evening. I thought to myself the place wouldn't be crowded because of the dismal weather, but I was wrong. Honky Tonk embodies all that bbq and Pilsen is, and should be. It's slightly hipster, but extremely authentic, down right, damn good barbecue.Naturally we ordered two old fashioneds. They were delicious and had a fun twist. There were orange bits on the bottom and a slightly cinnamon-y after taste. Of course we ordered the bacon candy...which is exactly what it sounds like: candied bacon. YUM...it paired perfectly with our drinks. For our mains we tried the brisket, pulled pork, a hot link, Mac n cheese, and the coleslaw. The brisket, hands down, is the best I've ever had. Tender is an understatement! If you come here and do not order the brisket then you are doing it all wrong. The pulled pork was also super yummy and flavorful....along with the juicy hot link. Ugh and the sauces...just heaven. Something for everyone: sweet, smokey, and a garlic (ish) one. The Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy deliciousness and the slaw was good too...very vinegar based if that's your thing.

Honkey Tonk is a low-key, casual/divey, neighborhood bar that serves up an appetizing menu of BBQ, brews & specialty house drinks. I guess it has\u00a0a more countryish theme than your average Chicago bar cuz it's called \"Honkey Tonk,\" serves Q & country-sounding, specialty drinks & plays music that's not hip-hop, pop, rock or alternative. But that's about as country as it gets at HT cuz you're more likely to find neighborhood locals & a crowd o'hipsters rather than any cowboys. HT is no-frills & is\u00a0dark with a bar & wooden booths & has a small stage for live bands.Nothing at HT really screams \"honkey tonk\" to me but perhaps the menu gives it southern cred! HT has a whole gamut of traditional BBQ offerings: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, sausage & the like. BBQ is my least fave food group to be honest & I really only like ribs from 1 place in Chi & 1 place in Memphis. But I was hungry so I tried food here for the first time on my last visit & got the\u00a0\"Girlfriend Salad.\" It's mixed greens with goat cheese, jicama, berries, walnuts, HT house dressing for $8 & I added BBQ chicken for $5. The salad was a big portion with ample fresh goodies & I think the chef placed a whole damn chicken on top! The chicky was very juicy & flavorful like a dry-smoked, BBQ seasoned kinda chick not drenched in BBQ sauce, thank goodness! Giddy-up! I'd eat this GF again, this was surprisingly one of the best chicken salads I've ate in awhile! The sides are a la carte so I got the small side of portobello mushrooms ($3.50) cuz I can't ever pass up a gemmy bowl o'shrooms! These guys were big & saut\u00e9ed to a crisp literally, the edges were a lil too crunchy for my preference. Good flava but ease up on the char-effect perhaps?! I also added on 1 corn muffin for $1.50. Presentation was cute but muffie was kinda cold. Kudos for bakin' it with real corn pieces inside though, was probably betta/fresha earlier that night but still tasty. I can't vouch for the ribs or other Q options at HT but based on my gemmy, BBQ chick-GF salad, I'd wager the other stuff is good too.FYI: If you're a fan of all things bacon, you're in for a treat cuz HT is known for its specialty starter, bacon candy. For $11 ya get a plate o'cut-up, caramelized, fried, crunchy bacon strips. I've tried it & I'm not a fan but lotsa peeps go hog wild over this shit!\u00a0HT has gotta a good selection of beer on tap & cool countryish, house drinks & lotsa liquor. I usually just go straight vodka but I did taste the \"Moonshine\" house cocktail ($8): It's bourbon, Veev Acai spirit, lemonade & house-made cherry. It's too sweet for my bitta blood, but I'm sure it'd only take a couple o'these & I'd be a Mello-Yello!\u00a0Last HT provides free, live musical entertainment for its patrons. The time lapse between my previous visits to HT & my most recent one has been quite awhile but if my memory serves me right, I believe there were blues-country, hillbilly rock genre kinda bands performing on past occasions. I can't be 100% certain since every time I've been to HT it's been quite\u00a0late & drinkin' straight vodka tends to blur the memory. But on my last to visit to HT, a jazz band was undeniably performing & not the cool, bluesy kinda jazz rather the \"I feel like I'm stuck on a GD, packed elevator & I wanna effin' hang myself kinda jazz!\" But ya can't always get what ya want!\u00a0So if you're in the mood for something a lil off the beatin' path or are cravin' some Q & live music in a low-key/neighborhood kinda joint, I recommend boot-scootin' into the Honkey Tonk BBQ in Chicago! A lotta peeps are supes cray about HT & would prob give it a 4 or 5, but I'm not really into C&W & am usually just ridin' bitch when I wind up here. HT isn't really one of my fave watering holes in Chicago but y'all might FUC luv it & I still think it's a pretty cool place to get some Q, brews & if you're lucky hear a lil blues!", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 4, 25]}, "21": {"description": "I love that they play live music here.

Not a goat cheese spread on the actual sandwich, which I thought was a little strange and over-priced.The mac and cheese is unique. It definitely has a sour spank and spice that makes me think of \"buffalo mac and cheese,\" but I'm not sure it actually has buffalo sauce in it. It's definitely different. The maple syrup encrusted bacon is decent, too, but doesn't come out piping hot. It's a little cold and dry on presentation, more like a maple syrup glazed beef jerky.I'm also a sweet tea snob, and their sweet tea tastes like Nestea... not sure if they just need to buy some better tea or what.

So, like a true North Carolina pig pickin', this might get a bit sloppy.The menu is pretty simple: an selection of sandwiches featuring pork, brisket or smoked chicken, or try a combination platter of the same, ranging from $14 -$33, depending on additional sides. There was a token, albeit very tasty, portobello mushroom sandwich topped with collard greens.Upon arrival, my beef brisket Delux Platter ($16) sent off as many mixed signals as the restaurant's d\u00e9cor - despite no visible smoke ring on the large mound of meat, the two top pieces were perfectly succulent and tender, glistening with just a touch of grease, and sprinkled with a dash of paprika-tinted rub. Unfortunately, the meat tucked below the trophy peak of goodness was gray and lifeless, impossible to tug apart and void of any discernible flavor, good or bad. The meat on the brisket sandwich our friend ordered looked much nicer, and was, enviously, more juicy. The pulled pork sandwich has subtle smoke flavors, a distinctive smoke ring, but the rock-hard roll was a simple throwaway.Unfortunately, not even the barbecue sauces could revive the monotone meats; a hat tip to South Carolina, the mustard-based sauce was tangy with a hint of honey, white vinegar and a queer note of raw garlic. The two ketchup-based sauces, while described by the waitress as \"one hot, one not\", tasted almost identical. I would guess the large squeeze bottle was a tad sweeter, maybe from a dollop of molasses - the second featured more vinegar and maybe a pinch of red pepper. The side dishes were also a conundrum - both bowls of macaroni and cheese were ice cold on the top, yet steaming hot on the bottom. I not sure what linear shift in the space-time continuum causes such a temperature inversion, but it made for a lively discussion at our table. Sadly, the b\u00e9chamel cheese sauce was flour-y and bland. The coleslaw, however, had a definite tang and crispness. The bowl of collard greens brought the meal to a complete halt. The green's \"pot liquor\" had a distinct taste of tobacco, or \"bong water\", as described by one taster. And while a tobacco leaf in collard pot isn't completely unheard of, I seriously doubt that was the case.The service was unremarkable; our food was delivered in less than 20 minutes and the dirty utensils and half-eaten plates of barbecue were cleared without comment.

Next, one should get the Texas Brisket Chili + Mac & Cheese (aka ChiliMac, with extra/additional side of the Mac if you're really hungry); and the other should get The Delux with both meats. The Hot Link is also a NTBM, so you may want an extra one of those. For side, the coleslaw is a little different and good, or the beans (which has more meat, in case you wanna go with the theme of my review). Then I'd breathe, and prepare yourself for banana crack: The Banana Pudding (NTBM). Also the Blueberry Cobbler, if they have it.

The female cashier (blonde short hair FYI) had a very rude tone when I asked her about the type of sauces they had. Ignoring the rudeness, I sat down and ate my delicious sandwich. While eating, and being a few feet away from the cashier I continued hearing the same rude tone towards other customers, that's when bad service ruined the food. It is amazing how one employee could not only ruin a meal, but how the rude service completely consumed the conversation. Being that, it is important to be clear, the food was excellent but the employees attitude created a tainted image for Honky Tonk BBQ.

Honkey Tonk is a low-key, casual/divey, neighborhood bar that serves up an appetizing menu of BBQ, brews & specialty house drinks. I guess it has\u00a0a more countryish theme than your average Chicago bar cuz it's called \"Honkey Tonk,\" serves Q & country-sounding, specialty drinks & plays music that's not hip-hop, pop, rock or alternative. But that's about as country as it gets at HT cuz you're more likely to find neighborhood locals & a crowd o'hipsters rather than any cowboys. HT is no-frills & is\u00a0dark with a bar & wooden booths & has a small stage for live bands.Nothing at HT really screams \"honkey tonk\" to me but perhaps the menu gives it southern cred! HT has a whole gamut of traditional BBQ offerings: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, sausage & the like. BBQ is my least fave food group to be honest & I really only like ribs from 1 place in Chi & 1 place in Memphis. But I was hungry so I tried food here for the first time on my last visit & got the\u00a0\"Girlfriend Salad.\" It's mixed greens with goat cheese, jicama, berries, walnuts, HT house dressing for $8 & I added BBQ chicken for $5. The salad was a big portion with ample fresh goodies & I think the chef placed a whole damn chicken on top! The chicky was very juicy & flavorful like a dry-smoked, BBQ seasoned kinda chick not drenched in BBQ sauce, thank goodness! Giddy-up! I'd eat this GF again, this was surprisingly one of the best chicken salads I've ate in awhile! The sides are a la carte so I got the small side of portobello mushrooms ($3.50) cuz I can't ever pass up a gemmy bowl o'shrooms! These guys were big & saut\u00e9ed to a crisp literally, the edges were a lil too crunchy for my preference. Good flava but ease up on the char-effect perhaps?! I also added on 1 corn muffin for $1.50. Presentation was cute but muffie was kinda cold. Kudos for bakin' it with real corn pieces inside though, was probably betta/fresha earlier that night but still tasty. I can't vouch for the ribs or other Q options at HT but based on my gemmy, BBQ chick-GF salad, I'd wager the other stuff is good too.FYI: If you're a fan of all things bacon, you're in for a treat cuz HT is known for its specialty starter, bacon candy. For $11 ya get a plate o'cut-up, caramelized, fried, crunchy bacon strips. I've tried it & I'm not a fan but lotsa peeps go hog wild over this shit!\u00a0HT has gotta a good selection of beer on tap & cool countryish, house drinks & lotsa liquor. I usually just go straight vodka but I did taste the \"Moonshine\" house cocktail ($8): It's bourbon, Veev Acai spirit, lemonade & house-made cherry. It's too sweet for my bitta blood, but I'm sure it'd only take a couple o'these & I'd be a Mello-Yello!\u00a0Last HT provides free, live musical entertainment for its patrons. The time lapse between my previous visits to HT & my most recent one has been quite awhile but if my memory serves me right, I believe there were blues-country, hillbilly rock genre kinda bands performing on past occasions. I can't be 100% certain since every time I've been to HT it's been quite\u00a0late & drinkin' straight vodka tends to blur the memory. But on my last to visit to HT, a jazz band was undeniably performing & not the cool, bluesy kinda jazz rather the \"I feel like I'm stuck on a GD, packed elevator & I wanna effin' hang myself kinda jazz!\" But ya can't always get what ya want!\u00a0So if you're in the mood for something a lil off the beatin' path or are cravin' some Q & live music in a low-key/neighborhood kinda joint, I recommend boot-scootin' into the Honkey Tonk BBQ in Chicago! A lotta peeps are supes cray about HT & would prob give it a 4 or 5, but I'm not really into C&W & am usually just ridin' bitch when I wind up here. HT isn't really one of my fave watering holes in Chicago but y'all might FUC luv it & I still think it's a pretty cool place to get some Q, brews & if you're lucky hear a lil blues!", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 4, 25]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Pilsen"], "latitude": 41.85779, "longitude": -87.65678, "rating": "3.5", "times": {"Mon": [], "Thu": ["4:00 pm", "2:00 am"], "Sat": ["4:00 pm", "3:00 am"], "Wed": ["4:00 pm", "2:00 am"], "Tue": ["4:00 pm", "2:00 am"], "Sun": ["4:00 pm", "2:00 am"], "Fri": ["4:00 pm", "2:00 am"]}, "price": "$$", "categories": [["Barbeque", "bbq"], ["Dive Bars", "divebars"]], "address": ["1800 S Racine Ave"], "attributes": {"Best Nights": "Fri, Sat, Sun", "Parking": "Street", "Has Pool Table": "No", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes", "Happy Hour": "Yes", "Delivery": "No", "Take-out": "Yes", "Music": "Live", "Has TV": "No", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Good for Kids": "Yes", "Wheelchair Accessible": "No", "Wi-Fi": "No", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "Full Bar", "Caters": "Yes", "Waiter Service": "Yes", "Coat Check": "No", "Attire": "Casual", "Ambience": "Casual", "Good For Dancing": "No", "Smoking": "No", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Noise Level": "Loud", "Good For": "Dinner"}, "category": "Bars", "number_of_reviews": "661"}, "tack-room-chicago": {"comments": {"3": {"description": "Fun atmosphere but oh-so-loud.

Eventually, they end up falling apart, and all that's left is a gooey mess of meat and beans. YUCK! Perez expertly rolls their burritos to perfection. They taste amazingly fresh, and are especially helpful in curing those next day hangovers you might have after a night of drinking. Be sure to visit Perez on Monday or Tuesday. They offer 1/2 off margaritas (only $4 on these nights). Their margaritas are one of a kind. Not too sour, not too sweet, with a generous inclusion of tequila, which is the most important ingredient! The servers are always friendly and intuitive, knowing exactly when to refill water and bring the check. It's a gigantic restaurant, so you will always find a seat, and never have to wait for a table. There is also a really cute outdoor patio, which is perfect for sipping on those margaritas and doing a little people watching on 18th St. But heed this warning: there are many street urchins, vagabonds, and riff raff on 18th St, so sit inside if you want to avoid the jungle outside!", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 8, 22]}, "8": {"description": "We love Perez.

It was two of us last evening and we ordered two: one strawberry and one mango. Horrible taste because they obviously use the cheapest tequila and the fruit juices tastes like Jumex. So it's a mix of jumex with the cheapest tequila. I even asked the waitress if they use real fruit for the margaritas and she said yes. But no, they use some type of colored water with fruit or something like Jumex juice. If you know what a good margarita tastes like, you will definitely regret ordering it here. When our waitress asked how it tasted we told her we didn't like the taste and she left right away. No friendliness whatsoever. Really bad service. We didn't drink the rest after tasting the bad flavor. We went to the cashier, she charged our bill, and another waitress started to argue with us because we were giving them our opinion. I asked if she had tasted other margaritas and she started arguing saying they could not please every client. She even showed us the bottle (like the color water used for raspados) they use for margaritas. Unbelievable! High-fructose color juice. We were very respectful with them, so I don't get why they didn't treat us like a customer. Hopefully, a manager reads this and I hope they provide better service in the future to non-regulars and they change their preparation of margaritass; or at least to have knowledgeable waitresses.

However, it's a frozen margarita that they give you a coffee-stirrer-sized straw to drink out of...come on, get normal straws for thick drinks. Other than that, it was clear they had issues with food timing in the kitchen despite not being very busy overall; everything on my taco dinner plate was barely lukewarm at best when arriving to the table, as was everything on my fiance's plate.

Until now, ha ha!)The menu was in flux when I arrived, with numerous items off the board and others taking its place, but that's OK: I got what I came for.Whenever it's available I always jump at the chance to get my favorite kind of burger: a mushroom burger. This burger had saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, an egg bun, and mustard aioli; nice and simple. The first thing I noticed about the burger was the bun; appropriately dense and built to withstand whatever was inside it. The second thing I noticed as I bit into the burger was the very flavorful aioli perfectly complementing the mushrooms, which were perfectly tender and flavorful.The last, but not least thing? Holy crap, the meat was good. Most burgers are made from factory-ground ground beef, which tastes OK and can fall apart. The giveway on this burger was the fact that it stuck together, and had a great beefy flavor. There's good reason to believe they process their own cuts for their burgers, and the resulting burger is fantastic. Ample amounts of seasoning helps.Homemade kettle chips are the fleur de potato of the truck. They undersell them as \"homemade potato chips\" but they may or may not be sweet potato chips, they were so sweet (and orange). There were some sweet spices on the chips, which may or may not be limited to cinnamon. Each slice was paper thin but very crispy, and these contrast with their burgers very well.So yeah.

Then he downgraded the size and quality of his burger patties. His freshly prepared hand cut fries were also downgraded to frozen generic fries. His once freshly made Caramelized onions were reduced to pre packaged onion crisps. His freshly baked Turano buns were also reduced to some generic brand. Now to the scariest part of this nightmare kitchen. They do not have a proper hand washing or sanitation station on board like required. Which means they can't wash their hands properly or clean anything they use. He does not require his employees to wear gloves on their hands which is worrisome because they aren't able to wash their hands in the sink. He rarely changes the oil in the fryer...usually cooks your fries in the same oil for about a month. The prep cooler can not properly cool the cheeses to a safe temperature which is a big health risk. Danny makes his money by using the lowest quality available and trying to pass it off as \"gourmet\". One might ask how I know this...and why you should believe me?

Tender, but lacking in flavor and \"chew\" texture- Steak: chock full of large chunks of tough gristle; this required a 2-taco minimum order, so very disappointingThe owner/cook does provide whole pickled jalapenos if you ask for it, and these were very well received.Even at $2.25 per taco, I can't recommend coming here for tacos unless you had no means of transportation to another place.

When the check arrived I paid with a credit card and in return was given a receipt with an empty pen casing.

The smoked salmon did not go well with the salad. The spinach was too old and bitter. The citrus dressing was very bland. It was basically orange juice with olive oil. I barely touched my salad.

Second: Why instruct your servers to inquire how a patron would like their meat cooked and then forgo any instruction and cook all meats to a well done state? There is a reason the people request their meat cooked to different degrees of \"done\". Those (like me) who request medium rare like their burgers to be pink and juicy in the middle. When you become accustomed to that style, well done meat tastes very dry and becomes hard to eat. Third: Your French Fries are dried out and withered. I ate no more than 5...

Granted, he spilled my drink a bit when he brought it over, but only because he filled it up so much! He said he \"doesn't like to waste.\" Always a plus. Price is slightly less to to what you would pay for at other places (ie Starbucks/Caribou). Not prohibitively expensive, not dirt cheap. I got a bit more than I paid for!Atmosphere: Chill. The music playlist has a great variety. The times I've been there the volume is not exceedingly loud where you have to raise your voice much to talk to the person with you. Their couch area in the back is great if you want a quieter place to study/get work done.There's artwork and high ceilings allowing for a homey and very roomy feel to the place. The artwork is for sale, if you're willing to shell out for it. It definitely makes the place feel very Pilsen. Extras: Wi-fi for me was fine (mainly since I came during a low-traffic time, probably) speed-wise. No problems whatsoever. I'm glad, actually they require the 3.50 minimum to get the password and for credit card use to make sure everything is well supported. Couches are very comfortable and not smelly!

I dropped it off on Friday with the agreement that he would kill two birds with one stone by going through my left pocket's lining (which already had a hole in it) to add a new substrate to repair the tear in the shoulder and then sew up the hole in the pocket. Price = $20. He asked me to come back on Tuesday, I asked what time, I was told anytime. I arrive Tuesday afternoon, and a woman has trouble locating my item, finds it, we see that the rip looks unfinished, she asks me to come in later because she's not sure if he's finished repairing it, I tell her I'll come in Wednesday just to be sure that the repair is finished. I stop by the store Wednesday afternoon and the door is locked. It's a small business, I get it, maybe whoever was there went out to run an errand. A \"be back in x minutes\" sign would've been nice, but whatever, I decided to come back on Thursday.This afternoon I received my jacket, examined the repairs with the man, noticed a rip by the pocket that has been glued and it confuses me.

I didn't want to assume it happened there, so I just accept it, pay him, and leave. So I get home and I'm bothered by what used to be an inconspicuous rip in the shoulder that I could hide with the collars to a new visible rip by the pocket. I review the \"before\" pictures of my jacket I took to share on Yelp and the rip by the pocket was never there! Bothered by this I decided to return to the shop to have it addressed. If this new rip was an accident, he should have told me when I picked it up. I calmly tell him that the rip by the pocket was never there. The man tells me he has no idea about it and said he only fixed the shoulder and the pocket, that's all. I show him the picture I took prior to bringing in my jacket, and he denies it, says his son was the one to fix it, offers to hold on to the jacket to ask his son about it. No, I do not trust my belongings there, so I said I would return later, in the evening, to ask his son about it. I return to the shop, and there's some kids running the show. I tell the oldest boys that I had brought my jacket in to be fixed earlier and ask who the person was who worked on it. He tells me it was his dad who is not there, and asks me to come in later.

I typically stay around Logan Square area but this definitely made me want to venture out that way more. It was a nice change from Logan Square, it felt like a more sophisticated but chill and true Chicago bar. I think that the set up of a bar is always the most important element because it constructs how people interact. The set up was the perfect balance of allowing people to sit and eat or chill and talk or mingle and dance. People were doin it all and everyone enjoying themselvesI mainly stayed on this lounge couch with new friends I met that night and mingled there and didn't even realize there was another large room around the corner that had stand up tables and areas to get your dance on. I was already feelin' it so just needed something to sip on I ordered a $2 tecate, which I thought was an amazing price for such a snazzy bar on a Saturday. Walking by tables, I saw almost everyone had a bowl of punch and were eating some fondue looking dish. (jealous) I looked at the menu the next day to check out the prices, and the prices seem very reasonable.. you can get a single glass of punch for $8 not too shabbyAlso, good move on the fish tank behind the bar Punch House good movess I never know where to take my sister when she comes in town and I finally found a spot.

Take some friends, take a date who you're gonna let into your pants later and have some really good cocktails and maybe dinner. Let's break it down.Booze: Dranks, hunny. The punch is good. Apparently sailors used to drink this when the water ran out, or to conserve water, or just because being out at sea was boring as hell, so they'd get a little drunk and rowdy and developed a bit of a rep. But now you're here. So when in Rome do like the Romans and \u00a0pick a punch, any punch. It will give you the tingliest buzz. Now you may feel like you overdid it. That's ok. Just have some food. If it's too strong, let the ice melt a bit and water it down. The first one may hurt, but after that, they all go down easy. And so will you if you don't drink responsibly. \u00a0But have fun. But drink responsibly. Worried about a severe hangover? Don't be. The punch has magical properties that at worst will make you feel achy the next day. You'll be well rested though. \u00a0Because after the buzz wears off, you will be sleepy. Unless you mixed it with things that are not Punch. In that case, Good Night and Good Luck, tomorrow. Food: The Juicy Lucy is a great burger, \u00a0but sometimes it's too salty. \u00a0I had the sausage sandwich. It was awesome. Garlicky with a good heat/spice to it. The shaved fennel was a nice touch and that split top buttered bun was nice and crisp on the outside. A stone ground mustard would have been nice. Crab dip, get it. It will change your life. Thanks for changing the bread. The epi, which is bread that's snipped before being baked so it looks like a branch with leaves, makes it easier to pull apart and share. Smart. Everything is pretty good, but I'd go for the special sandwich. Like the lobster roll they had before. \u00a0It will give you life. \u00a0It's accessible gourmand and I love it. Dessert is on point too. Sometimes the garnishes are better than the cake though. \u00a0The gele\u00e9, chocolaye sauce or Gelato may be more enjoyable than the donut or church it is meant to accompany. \u00a0That Fruit Loop dessert they serve is a prime example. Service and Ambiance: Walking in and heading down the black metal staircase feels sexy and slinky. I love a Fish Tank. I'd get one, but they are obviously labor intensive so, better not. Salt water fish tank gives off the coolest blue light. The place is retro, but tasteful. Some more cool features; the 2 lounge areas on either end where you can hang out with a big group, the secret room behind the bookshelf. Just ask the server to give you a tour, cuz I guess someone broke the secret handle and you gotta jiggle the damn thing a certain way now, the bar with the cool fish tank, the booths with the leather seats, snuggle up to someone when they dim the lights, \u00a0and finally the chalkboard bathroom, devolve into a 10 year old and draw dicks everywhere. If you stay til midnight, \u00a0and you're at the bar, they'll comp you a shot and you recite an old sea shanty as you take a swig. Only at the bar though. \u00a0Also, when it comes to finding good parking in Pilsen...may the odds be ever in your favor.Service is hit or miss. I love the place, so I excuse it, \u00a0but there isn't really an excuse when you're plunking down serious cash. I always have to flag my waiters down. They're nice, just busy and not super well trained. \u00a0If you're going with a big group for dinner, and everyone gets an app, entree and dessert, plus drinks, you're plunking down at least 150, if not 200. For that much moolah, \u00a0I shouldn't have to wave my white flag/napkin at you in surrender to get more drinks or my check. I know it's casual dining, \u00a0but service should never be casually given.

I tried a taco al pastor and a carne asada taco, served in a double tortilla with onion & cilantro, like many standard Mexican restaurants. Both were good; I preferred the carne asada, as the al pastor didn't have much seasoning or any pineapple chunks. My fiance had a cuban torta which he said was really good. Our other two friends are vegetarian, and this seemed like it might be a problem, as the only official meatless menu option was a veggie tamale, which they didn't want. One friend asked if they could make a burrito, which the server said they didn't have the right tortillas for, but the chef could make a veggie torta, which they agreed to. Our friends loved it! It had lots of colorful veggies with a cilantro-based sauce, and everyone who had the tortas said the bread was delicious and tasted freshly baked. Our friends said the chef should definitely put that sandwich on the menu! Tacos were just over $2 each, and tortas around $9. The entrees were mostly priced about $15 or less.

They do include avocado as well as other common burrito fillings, steak, cheese, beans, tomato, etc. They are $5 and I promise they will make a hungry man sleepy and pleasurably lethargic. The Casa Cafe has always been squeaky clean in my experience and they are BYOB. I'd highly recommend anyone looking for some affordable and quality Mexican food to stop by.Update: they raised prices which for me is a little bit of a deal-hurter.

Given my buddy was born, raised, still lives on 19th street in Pilsen, I knew he would have a reasonable go-to taco/torta stop. We hooved it down the street, only to find the family torta shop closed for business. Next door was Casa cafe so I headed in for some take-out. The menu is simple, offering breakfast, tacos, burrittos, and a few other adequate mexican dinner staples (nothing over the top or crazy here). Atmosphere is lacking and will definitely have you determining that take-out is a reasonable choice. \u00a0I ordered the taco combo dinner. The tacos are standard mexican street-tacos style, small double stacked corn tortillas filled with choice of meat. I went with the Lengua, Carne Asada, and Pastor (all with cilantro, onion, salsa verde, lime). The lengua was tasty, and I appreciated that it wasnt a whole slab of tongue, nor was it chopped to hell so you couldnt see the rough exterior taste buds. This is how I like my lengua. The pastor was the best of the three and was well marinated. As for the carne asada (generally how i judge my street tacos), it was par for course, but nothing special or worth heading back for. Sides that come with the dinner plate: The spanish rice was tasty and actually had fresh veggies and good flavor, but the refried beans were horendous, a perfect mess of lard and something that resembled a white cheese. The beans tasted of cardboard and looked like a ghost had hit them they were so pale in color. A bonus goes to the friendly women that took my order. We worked through some serious spanglish so my gringo belly could get some feed. of course my buddy chiming in at the right times in perfect spanish probably helped a lot more than I could understand.

All the food came out super fast and it was quite good. They were all under 7 dollars each. Service was friendly.Cons: cash only policy.

I follow a large number of tattoo blogs, have looked through most of the big-name Chicago-based artists' portfolios, gotten work from half a dozen people, and most of my friends have one or more tattoos and similar obsessions with wearable art. And when anyone asks me for advice on where to get a new piece, I only have one answer: \"Code of Conduct.\" So far, my girlfriend, her friend, one of my best friends, my boss, and another colleague have all taken this advice with incredible results.The shop:The atmosphere is clean and bright without being clinical somehow. Workstations are arranged around a large common area so everyone can watch and learn from each other. There's a lot of hovering and \"that's awesome how did you do it?\" among the artists, which I enjoy. The walls are decorated with sketches, oil paintings, photographs, and other forms of art, all of which is created or curated by the staff. With no piercers on their payroll, unlike other tattoo shops Code of Conduct is exclusively about the art (and a touch of fashion thrown in), with less of a focus on walk-in business and more focus on custom work than some may be used to at other \"tattoo and piercing factories.\"The staff:So far I only wear work by one of the artists at Code of Conduct - more on him shortly - but in the many many hours I've spent in the shop, I have seen incredible work spring from under the hands of every member of the staff. Each definitely has his own style and strengths but they all share knowledge, advice, techniques, and a strong drive to constantly better their craft. Plus, they're friendly, hilarious, and very laid-back. Because they take their work very seriously (like any artist should), if you're looking to walk in with a google image of someone else's tattoo that you think is really cool and want the same thing, this probably isn't the place for you. If you want an incredible, unique, custom piece of art that requires you to give some effort and forethought, research portfolios and make an appointment.My guy:I first explored Allie Sider's digital portfolio back in 2009 and was immediately jealous of the people who got to wear his ink. Even from a distance, his attention to minutiae and skill with black-and-grey were mind-boggling, and I can personally guarantee you that it only gets more impressive up close. I'm a visual artist and lighting designer by trade, so you can imagine how floored I was to find a tattoo artist that actually thought about light sources and shadows! Allie manages to work in some of the finest, tiniest details I've ever seen, his lines are always super clean, and his shading techniques vary from intricate pencil-thin crosshatching to sublimely smooth watercolor, depending on the piece. He has a very light hand and gets it done without chewing your skin up, so his work heals much faster than others' (I'm talking like a week, week and a half at most!). Plus he's a great guy that I can actually have a conversation with for hours on end - and all my friends who wear his work agree. In the five years I've been visiting him, Allie has done my entire upper back, a small piece on my left arm, and we're halfway done with a full shoulder-to-wrist sleeve on my right arm. For black-and-grey (he does do color sometimes, it's just \"not his thing\"), as far as I'm concerned there's none better.

I had recently visited Deluxe tattoo to get a consultation on a piece I had been wanting. The man there said it was impossible and would look stupid on the body. O RLY? Well Johnny McDevitt did it just yesterday. And let me tell you, it looks amazing. so many people are giving me compliments (while the sucker is still covered in goo-goo-overnight-bandage-blood. They are either all correct that it is awesome, or they are vampires. Highly unlikely. Also, I was quoted at a lot of other shops in price ranges going into the 500+...never in my life for something this size. Its about 7 x 5 inches. Only 6 colors used. No way. Johnny asked for 400, I said I didn't want to go beyond 350, and he agreed. I knew I'd be paying the above average price for myself, considering I normally go to small - town shops in Southern ILL, so for a Chicago tatt THIS nice...It was perfectly reasonable. No stiffler's here. Sadly, Johnny McDevitt is transferring to Insight Studios tattoo. I will most definitely be contacting him in the future. I believe he is the nicest tattoo artist I have ever met. He is open for a joke, ready to converse (or not if you need a moment to breath, haha). He was so patient . This was my 4th tattoo, but I had \u00a0not had one on the front of my body before where I could WATCH, so I was pretty anxious. It was like he was just so happy to be there doing something different, he didn't even care if I was letting out the few occasional \"ow, ow, ow's\". It took maybe 3 weeks to solidify a time and a day, but it was very much worth it , and we BOTH were to blame for the complications and issues outside of the world of tattoos, so there was nothing but forgiveness :) \u00a0I will be posting a picture very soon. I am so happy with this piece. And I am very happy I found Johnny.

That was a time when I was listening to UGK and Hurricane Chris on my iPod nano, and writing way too many Yelp reviews instead of spending time with someone I was dating. No regrets. A lyrical gangsta like me was married to the game. Years later Take Me Out is a stones throw away. While I don't eat here that often, I love that it's so close. Lets face it. Sometimes you want wings but also want Chinese. Maybe you're white and part Chinese like Keanu Reeves. You'd be eating at Take Me Out a lot. But when you want real ass sports bar style wings, or old dirty Chinese restaurant (formally ODB) food, this hybrid fare just won't cut it. It's also more expensive.

My uncle used to take me to the original location on the North side when I was little to indulge in these delicious little hotties. So eating them is quite the nostalgiac experience for me everytime I go here. -The Bad-*The fried appetizers are good but on the pricey-end. \u00a0While they ARE good, you can get them at any other Chinese/Asian restaurant in the Chicago for half the price. So that's a downer on the points. Pot stickers are good, not amazing, but good. Crab Rangoon is delicious. *The fried rice tastes like it's been cooked with PAM cooking spray, and while it's not gross, it does leave an odd taste in the mouth. HIGHLY unusual for fried rice (but it's edible). *The BONELESS hotties are not great. I do not recommend them. Why? If you've had take out from any Chinese restaurant, the boneless chicken in Sweet-n-sour chicken entrees are fried in a way that outer layer of crust if fluffy and crisp, and the chicken breast within is juicy and cooked perfectly. However, the boneless chicken that come in the Boneless Hotties at Take-Me-Out are quite disappointing. A bit overcooked, unusually dense, and they are not infused with enough hottie sauce to make them taste like the normal bone-in hotties. \u00a0(still good though, but not worth the extra money). The sauce just \u00a0doesn't stick to the chicken, but it seems like an fix that could be remedied with a simple recipe change. (It's a texture thing). *Delivery service is VERY expensive and a tad slow, but it's probably improved.

While they do have little meat on the bone, the marrow alone is full of flavor and it is filling (I eat a lot, and the portion for two with rice was way too much for my brother and I to finish--a good value too). It's a nice hole in the wall on 18th street to take kids and friends. Staff is always friendly, and I never wait long for my food. They quote me ten minutes but i usually get my order in 5. Owner is very friendly and they have added a lot more menu items that I have yet to sample--I look forward to doing so!My experience here is always consistent and I admire that from new businesses on 18th.

When I gave him a brief description of what I usually do, he asked again how I wanted it. I asked him if he had any suggestions and told me he couldn't tell me what to do. I told him I needed it cleaned up and again gave general guidelines on how I style it. Again, I got a blank (and annoyed) stare.

Well, he then gave me the same \"I can't tell you what to do.\" Maybe I wasn't super-detailed but I don't think I was so ambiguous as to confuse him. My hair is short so there's not too much to shortening it a bit, thinning it and fading on the sides. Since we didn't seem to be on the same page, I told him I was going to someone who might have an idea of what to do. I got up out of the chair and he said nothing. This is the first time I've ever done that and hopefully the last. This is also the first review i've ever written and decided to do it mostly so that management is aware of the toxic worker on their hands.

I asked them if they use real beef and they could not even tell me which was very disturbing to me and I forced them to find out and if they were fresh made meatballs they would've told me right away but they had to go inside and look on the box of premade garbage meatballs and they found out that indeed they were made with soy protein. \u00a0I do not expect authentic Italian restaurants in Little Italy to be using premade garbage like that and would never have thought to ask before serving then to my son if there would be fake meat in there.

I saw many people walking around with arms full foil-wrapped plates; I'm guessing for future meals.* A stage (with folding chairs) playing oldies and old Italian favorites. The cast of Jersey Boys did a few numbers and the Drifters stopped by as surprise guests too! * Plenty of fun people watching - there was no shortage of wife-beaters (the shirts), men with gold jewelry, skimpy tight clothing, and cute, little Italian old-timers rocking out to the music.

I got a no-chip on Friday.... Its Wednesday night and one of my nails started peeling back. \u00a0I paid $40 for this and 5 days later its peeling? \u00a0I am going on my honeymoon soon and really want a no-chip that lasts...

This is why:1.) Their grocery selection sucks ass. If you're making mexican food, you're in the right place. Otherwise, you're shit outta luck. Things that I thought were grocery store staples, I couldn't find here. In terms of the products they do sell, you'll only find the cheapest brands. I'm not saying I can afford Whole Foods shit, but every once in a while I like to get the expensive sorbet, some nice rustic bread, half-decent baking chocolate, you know what I mean? 2.) Nobody speaks English. I'm not one of those people that thinks everyone in this country needs to speak English immediately. However, if you're working in a customer service position, and you're working in America, you better fucking speak at least SOME English. At least SOME, for God's sake. That's all I ask! And when all I want to know is \"Where are the onions?\" or something like that, it's really annoying to have to go through the whole pantomiming/repeating myself thing. 3.) The checkers have attitudes. Actually, maybe it's just that the few times I've been there, I got the same girl. Could be. Anyways, I work in customer service (at a grocery store!) myself, and I always make sure to treat my customers well, and I expect the same thing from employees that wait on me. I don't know what prompted the raised eyebrow, not looking me in the eye once, or shoving the receipt at me without saying \"have a good night,\" \"goodbye\" or anything, but this is how it is each time I go.4.) That pay-at-the-meat-counter thing. For some reason, you have to buy your meat separately from all your other groceries. If you try to buy other grocery items along with your meat, they won't let you. I tried to ask the woman at the meat counter why this was, but....yeah, she didn't speak English. Haha. I've pondered the reason many times. I guess people like to steal meat. Anyway, the first time my boyfriend and I shopped there, we bought some ground beef. When we saw the woman ringing it up, we were confused and told her, \"we're not ready to check out yet, can we pay for it with our other groceries later?\" She looked at us confusedly, and gave it to one of the butchers, whom, without explaining anything to us, took it and started quickly walking over to the registers. We kept saying \"wait, excuse me\" and \"what's going on?\" but he wouldn't explain anything. He handed it to one of the checkers, and we had to go to her line to check out. So strange. So fucking annoying. If someone had said \"Sorry, you can only buy your meat at the meat counter,\" we probably would've just shrugged and said 'that's weird, but ok.' But the fact that we went through that whole process for a stupid little thing like that really pissed us off.i will mention El Guero's one redeeming quality, which is, actually, their meat counter.

Sasha is cool and very approachable. Stephanie is kind and also cool. The staff in general is pretty laid back and chill. I like the vibe the shop and staff exhibits.3.

While you can get accessories here insanely cheap (which is where they get the stars) the actual ability to service your bike gets zero stars. I had two separate instances here that were so awful that when I lived in Pilsen I would sometimes take my bike on the bus to go somewhere else for repairs.The first instance I went in after someone had run over my wheel while it was parked somewhere. Some idiot in University Village had gone onto the sidewalk in their SUV and when I came out of the bank my bike was under their car. I walked it to Irvs and asked for help. They gave me a wheel, I went home to install it, and realized it was not the right size. This was minorly annoying but I went back the same day and said I would just leave it, they could install the wheel. I get the bike back, ride for a few weeks, and then I get a flat. This is when I realize how horrible the maintenance job was. At the time I was fairly naive about bikes, I hadn't inspected their handiwork. Well, instead of putting in the necessary components for the wheel to fit, they had loaded the screw with bolts which were not the right width for the gap (this is on my rear tire) and had decided snug was better than loose so they somehow jammed the wheel into place. When I went to take it off for the patch repair it was jammed in so tightly that when I finally got it out the wheel literally flew out about 5 feet. Upon further inspection I saw that my frame was now cracked from the pressure of having the wheel jammed in. Fantastic. I ended up getting a newer bike not long after (because my other bike was now unsafe) and when my brakes were loose I figured \"hey, despite my crappy previous experience, this just needs to be tightened, it's hard to screw up, I'll give them another chance.\" I'm an idiot. The simple task was done so improperly that as I was riding away from Irvs minutes later, I gently tapped the break while going over the train tracks on 18th street and MY ENTIRE BREAK CABLE CAME OFF.

The twin mini-sandwiches (I had expected one larger sandwich) were tasty enough, but messy to deal with -- the fresh tomato and lettuce and the unneeded garlic mayonnaise instantly wilted on contact with the hot meat, producing major drippage. BTW this was not one or two slices of steak, as I had imagined, but a handful of tiny meat pieces -- OK I suppose. I was less pleased with the other items. Normally I LOVE maduros -- delicate pillows of sweet fried goodness. These were underripe and very dark, as if they were cooked in bad oil, or too long, or both. Yellow rice was dry and sticky. My shrimp empanada had a good flavor but, again, was dark brown instead of golden brown. This is counter service cooked to order -- not fast food -- so don't go in a big hurry.Prices are reasonable.

He clearly knew what he was doing, asked me a lot of questions about my hair and checked in with the plan before he started cutting. I love that. Super nice guy, talkative but in a genuine way and not in an exhausting way. He was clearly focused on what he was doing and checked with me several times throughout the cut to see if things were going how I thought and to see what my hair was doing as it dried. Pretty awesome. Best haircut in a very long time, no joke.Plus, I was floored by the price, and in a good way. The price was incredibly reasonable, I was shocked.

So I do return for that. But I will say that I only go this cafe when I have time to sit down to eat. More specifically, from a material waste standpoint, this cafe is great to sit down and enjoy your food and beverages, but not worth the waste to get take out from. Positives: Kristoffer's has all washable dishes when you dine in. Plates, silverware and mugs. Also, some of their baked goods are simply under glass without any unnecessary packaging. \u00a0 Negatives: Kristoffer's Cafe, although they have all of the washable items for dining in, some patron's beverages are still served in to-go cups. Mainly, though, most of Kristoffer's Cafe's waste comes from their to-go packaging. They serve a single slice of flan or Tres Leches in their own plastic to-go container. To-go beverage cups are plastic, and the food is accompanied by plastic cutlery. I really love this Pilsen cafe, and feel badly about giving them a low rank, but the environment is suffering from the waste that restaurants produce every day and it is time that even the little companies to pay more attention to these details. Kristoffer's Cafe: consider switching to plant-based, biodegradable containers for you to-go containers, and give all eat-in customers washable cups, instead of disposable cups!

Which pretty much meant a showdown between bombon and kristoffers. To be fair, we made sure we got the same flavors, the classic and the caramel, along with a few others, from each store, but used the common flavors to decide the winner. Both of them are excellent tres leches, both get a five. What is different is what you prefer in a tres leches. K has a firm and moist and delicious tres leches, B is a really moist soaked in milk tres leches. For me, a tres leches should be as the name suggests. Soaked in milk. Which is why B, won by an absolute small margin. Like 0.001. However, what should be noted, is that bombon uses a cup shaped container that the cake fits in perfectly, which means the milk stays in the cup and keeps the cake milkiliciously moist. K serves you a slice, in a square ribbed container that makes it difficult to get all the delicious milk. \u00a0Therefore, I personality believe it's more of a container caused difference than a flavor or talent in baking issue. K is truly excellent, their tres leches is a must have.Another time, I went there for the tres leches and their tamales and both the chicken and veggie were really good. I plan on going back for more tres leches (can you tell I love this place??) And some chocoflan.

The horchata latte was so flavorful and you couldn't even tell it was a latte (which might deter some people I realize). On our way out we got a piece of the coconut tres leches cake since they had so many to choose from. It was fabulous - it didn't even make it home.

At Kristoffer's you tip before you even see what your food looks like - before it's brought to your table (if you're paying with a debit card). I'm not sure what to do about tipping at Kristoffer's. I'll explain.I walked into Kristoffer's and it's homey. There are about six or seven small tables and two grungy couches. We thought about sitting on the couches but thought they looked too dirty to sit on. We even discussed how the owner might consider getting a cover for them. Kristoffer's is the type of place for college students who want a quiet place to study and free wifi. I didn't see anyone eating food.Since Kristoffer's is a bakery/cafe/restaurant it wasn't immediately clear to me how I should begin. For example, do I wait to be seated? Do I seat myself and wait to be served? Do I order at the counter? The latter turned out to be the case.A very friendly gentleman took my order of 20 oz Mexican Hot Chocolate for $3.50. While I ordered, I explained that I was meeting a friend for lunch. He responded that I can wait for her at one of the tables or a couch. I liked him and found his manner to be welcoming.A lady brought my hot chocolate to me (see the picture). It was NOT 20 oz. It was in a large mug, but not THAT large. I didn't say anything, but even my receipt says that I should have gotten 20 oz.My friend arrived and she is a lively lady. She is much more overt when it comes to things than I am. Since it wasn't clear if they were going to come and take our order (especially since I told the gentleman that we wanted lunch ahead of time), she loudly asked from our table what we should do. We were instructed to go to the counter and order.My friend ordered an omelet with a side of bacon and coffee. I got chilaquiles. We both got ChocoFlan for dessert to be brought to our table later. It came to $29.55. I paid with my debit card where the only option was to use my PIN. A prompt came up to enter a tip, which I did.Our food was brought to us in a timely fashion. My friend noted that the vegetables were mixed into the eggs and then it was folded over the cheese. She explained that it really wasn't an omelet but a frittata. She gave it 2 stars because it was something that she could have made at home. I also saw the bacon was very thin and low quality.I've had chilaquiles at another restaurant before and liked it. The food that was brought to me at Kristoffer's was pretty gross. I eat almost anything including leftovers that are well over a week old - I hate wasting food! What was brought to me at Kristoffer's was garbage. I took small bites of the chilaquiles, the rice, and the refried beans. The refried beans that were served on the side were disgusting, and I love refried beans. I've never come across refried beans that I disliked. I don't know how this place ruined them. Maybe they were old? I couldn't tell. And I didn't like the rice.My friend suggested that I say something about how much I disliked the food. I considered it, but the server never came by to check on us. My friend called over (in her loud voice) and told the server that I didn't like my food. The server questioned if I'd ever had chilaquiles before and explained that people come from all over the place to eat theirs. I didn't tell her exactly what I hated about it (I simply said I didn't like it) nor did she offer to do anything about it.Let me describe the chilaquiles to you. It seemed as if they started with Doritos and then cooked them in a pot with tomato paste until they were nice and soggy. They put it on my plate and put cheese on top. There was no meat and no eggs.Our ChocoFlan was really delicious. My friend said that she would go back for it. I liked it very much but don't think that it warrants another visit. It was different from what I expected. I thought it would be chocolate flavored flan. Instead it's regular flan with chocolate cake on top. Neither the flan nor the chocolate cake is especially sweet.So back to tipping. I had to tip up front because I paid with a debit card. How much do you tip when you order at a counter? Normally I don't tip at all but sometimes I'll tip a dollar or two (in a jar by the register, you know?). But if I was at Caribou and if I didn't like the drink they would offer me something else. Most restaurants would do the same thing. So I don't know what's up with Kristoffer's but I wish that I could get back the tip that I gave them up front and the money for the chilaquiles and I wish I could give my friend a better birthday meal than a 2 star \"omelet.\" Oh yeah - it was her birthday.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 2, 27]}, "33": {"description": "I don't know how else to describe this but the following: the most underrated dessert in Chicago that I have experienced in the past year.

I had the the cuban pork, the roasted red pepper with goat cheese, and the loaded steak fajita tamales. All three were nothing but masa. Waaay too thick and barely any filling. Even the sauces were underwhelming. The \"loaded\" steak fajita tamale was just bad and I counted only 3 small pieces of steak inside. And for $5.00, seriously? Very disappointing all around. I couldn't even finish them. If you want good tamales in Pilsen, believe me, you won't find them from this place. I'm all about non traditional mexican food but these are very poorly executed. I would never recommend this place to anyone. There are much better places in Pilsen.

Also, as other reviewers stated, the lack of chicken was definitely noticeable. I think I saw 2 small pieces in the fairly giant tamale. The rest of the visit went sort of down hill from here... The goat cheese/veggie tamale was just not my cup of tea, and neither were the bite of my partner in crime's tamales, the juicy lucy and black bean.

For people trying to find a replacement for a \"real\" cigarette, they have the only liquid I've found that actually gives you the taste of an actual cigarette -- not just a tobacco leaf flavor, but something that comes amazingly close to the burning paper and tobacco taste you'd get from the real deal. \u00a0It's called... get this: \u00a0ILLUSION.So, on to the con:They have a sign, but it's on the inside and only visible if you're looking through their front window. \u00a0On my first attempt to find them, I gave up. \u00a0On my second attempt, I passed them twice despite my GPS telling me when I'd arrived.Guys! \u00a0Get a sign on the OUTSIDE of the building. \u00a0*** Update *** - No more cons! \u00a0They have a sign!Bottom line:Great people, amazing selection of flavors, good selection of eCigs and equipment. \u00a0They're my official go-to and the best shop in the city.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 12, 18]}, "4": {"description": "OMG!

Points for trying to be original but the taste was not good. The cinnamon on a burger was wrong. The french toast slices, bread already soaked in eggs and milk, were too delicate and fell apart immediately. The duck bacon tasted like regular turkey bacon, nothing special. Queso fresco does not melt so there was no creaminess in this burger. The meat had a good flavor but that was the highlight.

I really appreciate the brevity of the menu, if there were any MORE choices, I would probably never eat here due to the sheer impossible task of deciding what to eat.

They're somewhat small, but so packed full of flavor I couldn't complain.My date had the Kobe burger which was also AMAZING. The meat was so juicy and well flavored, topped with carmelized onions, garlic butter and an egg. Probably one of the best damn burgers I've ever had.

La Cebollita has DEFINITELY hired a new chef & changed the staff, so someone must be reading these Yelp reviews!!Firstly, this reminded me of those spot-in-a-wall spots that's secretly run by the mafia - NOT because it's shady (it's actually a fantastically decorated sit-down restaurant), but because of the AMAZING quality + price! \u00a0 From the outside, I wasn't expecting much from the restaurant since the signage was older... BOY was I in for a surprise!!The restaurant walls were painted in festive shades of earthy red, orange, and yellow. The heating pipes were shiny as chrome rims of Mexican town tune-ups, the tables had white tablecloth AND an extra layer of white paper on top, plenty of seating, updated kitchen (trust my chef bf to peek through the open windows just to examine their kitchen gears), and the walls had gorgeous painting + artsy photographs portraying life in Mexico! \u00a0There were curious photos of accordions, and ladies in festive dresses that struck me as more Cuban than Mexican, but the food were STRAIGHT-UP authentic Mexican cuisines!Now... on to the food...Free Chips & Salsa: This is the standard affair in any Mexican restaurant you go to, even the little joint next to the Addison red line station. But La Cebollita take their salsa seriously, with its red salsa chunky, filled with REAL tomatoes, jalapeno and onion. The salsa verde was incredibly flavorful, I honestly tasted a chicken-broth base and both salsas had just the right hint of spices! ALL THESE QUALITY INGREDIENTS IN THE FREE APPETIZER?! Appetizers: so many things to choose from... but only 1 stomach... we ordered the Tortilla Soup, which is a popular street vendor food in Mexico, and almost \"too-common\" to be served as a legit sopa in most restaurants. \u00a0Naturally, we had to order it. WoW. The soup was thick with flavor and made with chicken broth base, dabbed with crunchy, fried tortilla strips and additional slices of avocado upon request. My bf was so touched by its authenticity that he literally sat in silence, sipping the soup for 10minute, and let out a huge sigh of content upon finishing the soup.Entrees: I absolutely luuuuuuv mole!! \u00a0Did you know they have over 50 varieties of Mole served in Mexico, depending on which state / region you are in? \u00a0The traditional ingredients include chocolate, crushed concha cookies, 20+ spices cooked in a large earthy pot for more then 20 hours? \u00a0 The mole poblano was OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! \u00a0Full-bodied, thick dark brown gravy that had just the right amount of herbal spices, with a balance of chocolate tint. \u00a0The chicken was tender and juicy, fell right off the bones with the touch of your fork. Served with a side of refried beans (with extra herbs mixed in) and yellow rice, with bits of carrots & cilantro mixed in. \u00a0My favorite part of this dish? The chefs accentuated the flavor of mole with sprinkles of white sesame seed on top..... yummm!Torta de Lomo - I was too full after the mole and only took a bite out of the torta, but the bread was crunchy and fresh, the skirt steak juicy and thoroughly marinated, with the perfect complement of sliced lettuces and tomatoes! \u00a0The perfect amount of sour cream makes all the difference!Beverage: I am not kiddin' you when I tell you my FAV. drink in the world is Horchata water! \u00a0La Cebollita scored the highest in my book in the ENTIRE Chicago! Strong cinnamon flavor coupled with condensed milk, half & half and milk, the horchata was fresh and in no-way watered down!!Needless to say, we both walked out of La Cebollita Grill stuffed like Thanksgiving turkeys with half of the torta to take home. \u00a0I just took 20minute to dedicate this review, because this restaurant rocked our worlds!! \u00a0We will definitely be back for more!!-- Must-haves next visit --Tamales: I haven't had a chance to try their amazing Tamales- this is a breakfast affair so I gotta wake up early enough to grab some before they run out!Postres: \u00a0Arroz con leche?!

To start, the salt and pepper shakers were crusty and practically empty, it was obvious that it had been a long time since they were last refreshed. We were given stale chips and the salsa did not taste fresh either. My daughter and I ordered the breakfast special that came with eggs, a tamale and potatoes with chorizo. The eggs were passable, but the tamale had a lot of masa and the meat was sparse. The potatoes had clearly been boiled a while ago and just tossed with the chorizo, it did not taste good at all. My husband ordered an omelet which he said was good, but the rice on the side was bland. It just seemed like this place completely gave up and wasn't even trying. I have no plans to return here. I cannot believe they serve their customers such low-quality food. Also, the place was empty, there's no excuse for the salt and pepper shakers to be so gross, the sugar bowl as well and lastly, the menus smelled like they had been wiped down with a dirty dish rag.

I was definitely excited for this because I LOVE hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurants! When we arrived, they already had a large table to accomodate us (13 people), and immediately came out with complimentary chips, and two types of salsa. The salsa was very good and gave the table an option of a milder salsa verde and a hotter red salsa. As other reviews said, the chips were a little stale, but I'm going to chalk that up to the Chicago humidity as the temperature has been so wonky the last few days!With any new mexican restaurant, I judge their food by their most basic, staple food....the taco :) I ordered three tacos, two carne asada and one al pastor. The meat on both was very tasty, seasoned well, and not dry at all (which \u00a0can happen with even the best mexican restaurants). I was surprised that their standard taco came with lettuce and tomato AND cilantro and onion....kinda a hybrid of mexican and american style? I opted for just the onions and cilantro. The tacos were also very generous with the meat. Friends around me opted for other fares....the enchiladas which were a very generous portion and you had your option of stuffing, or a giant chimichanga that most people wouldn't be able to finish!Overall it was a good experience!

About 10 years ago almost all of the buildings between 18th street and Cermak along Halsted were filled with high quality fine artists. From photographers to large scale installation artists. I personally knew the tenant who rented the building smack dab on the corner of Halsted and 18th and he had a wonderful working installation piece that was an arch with thousands of bottle caps riveted into the 20 foot sculpture....he was priced out of the space. Moved to LA where the rent is just as high but the exposure and acceptance of artists is much more viable.Chicago is a shitty place for most visual artists who have not yet made a name for themselves. Most midwesterners have more interest in the Cubs than the arts. Even if the Cubs continue to lose they still have people paying for tickets. Not so with art. The minute the economy got bad and the real estate market started sliding the artists who used to be part of this vibrant community were shafted by slumlord tactics of high rents and an 'imagined' River North Gallery atmosphere. When it was evident the 'district' was not going to bloom in the gentrified way they wanted, the owners just alienated the artists enough by raising the rents and leaving the buildings in dilapidated conditions so they would leave. AND, guess what? Surprise, they did. They mecca'd to NYC and LA. I wasn't surprised.The artistic environment in Chicago is quite small and limited and does very little to encourage artists to reach their creative peak and then, even if they do, most of the community is ready to tear them down for fear of never clawing their way to the figurative 'top'.It is no surprise that most of the reviews of the Chicago Arts District are negative. If you could have actually seen the district when it was a supportive, creative, vibrant microcosm of art you probably would have a different opinion.But, all we can do now is continue to support the people who have stuck it out in Pilsen, literally against all odds. There are some really great stores, Deliciously Vintage, Agga B....to name a couple. The Chicago Art department is an artists collective that has gallery space there and they produce some stunning works for working peoples' prices.Attend the 2nd Friday's event they host once a month. Stop in at the 'tourist center' on the south corner of 18th and Halsted and grab a brochure of galleries open during the event. You will be amazed and surprised that there is life beyond River North. The galleries are warm and friendly, not pretentious. Most of the owners and artists are present and love to talk about their work. The last 2nd friday's event was even sponsored by the Italian Expo...and they had the best risotto I have ever had.It is important to support this community instead of just schlepping down Halsted and complaining that you don't like the art. Now more than ever, Pilsen artists need to be supported in Chicago.

There are some other free events that happen only once or so a year, but this is every month and so its a free friday every month.It's definitely better in the summer, but my favorite part about the art district is that there are regular performances here. Performance art can sometimes be difficult to find, especially to find for free. It's not something that sticks around for a long time, too, so to be able to go somewhere when I know I can see a little bit of crazy and confusing every month is awesome.In the summer, lots of people are out and there's usually more free booze than usual (you can find free booze most galleries, but there are suggested donations almost everywhere, too--they pour them STRONG though).There are a lot of galleries that I just kind of run through--you don't see something every time, but when you do, it's really cool, and the artist is usually somewhere close by and more than happy to answer questions. It's not too easy to hang out with the other patrons here (for some reason that spontaneous interaction never happens) but speaking with artists, or if you bring friends and you all see something you think is awesome or something you think is the weirdest thing you've ever seen, it can be a really great bonding experience. It's tough in the winter, but I've become friends with some of the artists there and there's an open conversation with people always willing to talk about their art.
