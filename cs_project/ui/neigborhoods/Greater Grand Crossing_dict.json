I called around and got some prices, and this place told me a pedicure was $22, I was used to pay $16, but my feet needed to be done so I went for it.I showed up as a walk in and they were slightly busy. I took forever choosing a nail color because they didn't have the shade of red I wanted, but eventually I chose something. I waited for about 30 minutes before I was serviced.There were 3 men in there getting their feet done so it made me feel a little more confident that they'd probably do a good job because men usually have ATROCIOUS feet. I'm not sure of the woman's name who did my feet but she did an AWESOME job, probably the best or 2nd best pedicure I've ever had in my entire life.

This time I brought my girlfriend and we had the opportunity to talk to the owner Pam; she was so sweet and so excited about her business. \u00a0She spoke to us like we were VIP I mean straight celeb status. \u00a0What made me want to come back more than anything was her positive passion for her business and the food.She allowed us to taste the Alabama Bonfire Pulled Turkey for 7.99 and it is so worth it because she uses real turkey that is slowly smoked or roasted(IDK and I don't care which one it was all I know is it was soooooo good) \u00a0If you like Turkey I say TRY THIS!!! You won't be disappointed and the Alabama BBQ sauce is delicious. \u00a0Please note even if you like cheese don't mess up this fabulous treat with cheese Enjoy it as is!What can I say about the freshly ground BYOBB(BUILD YOUR OWN BURGER) made to order Sirloin Burger? \u00a0What can't I say? \u00a0I wasn't expecting the mound of tasty and flavorful beef to touch my tongue and marinate with my taste buds in such away that I savored each bite as I bit into my sandwich. \u00a0If you check out my pictures you will see why it's worth 7.99 and the add-ons are from .49 to .99 not a bad deal at all. \u00a0I added mushrooms, Bonfire Smoked Cheese and bacon(make sure you say you want your bacon crispy) I also added the marinated red onions for free.This is one of the reasons I like the Owner Pam so much because although the Turkey Burger was good it wasn't great. \u00a0The flavor on the turkey was on point but because they are made then frozen it took away from the amazing burger and when we told her our opinion she didn't give us an attitude she actually listened and took what we said as constructive criticism. For all my Turkey Burger Heads let Pam know you are willing to wait for a fresh burger with a great price and good flavor I know she will appreciate it.They use all fresh ingredients nothing canned...I think that's what set her apart from other places as well. \u00a0She runs or has a community garden where they get there fresh veggies for the salads.Don't worry if you are a Vegetarian or you know someone that is because they have a variety of fresh items for you as well like Grilled Portabella Sandwich, Tofu Wrap, Bonfire Veggie Burger, Tofu Omelet and Salads. A plus is the Vegetarian items are cooked on their %100 Vegetarian Only Grill!!!They also serve Maxwell Street Style Food, BBQ and soup.They no longer serve the turkey tips at this time but we can cross our fingers that they come back.We also tasted the Shaken Lemonade and Ice Tea very good and a large is only 1.89.She also thinking about having a soul food day on Saturdays...I hope she does because she was saying the green would come straight from the garden...Yum!You WON'T FIND any \u00a0fried chicken, fried catfish, mozzarella sticks, etc. it's all about the grill and freshness. \u00a0They do have French fries though...lolIf you can't tell I love the food and I think the owner is great and I think we need to support this place because the owner cares about her customer and has a passion for her food!!Give them a chance and don't forget too....Enjoy!!!!", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 7, 9]}, "11": {"description": "Hands down the best rib tips on this side of town.

It was close and convenient. \u00a0I wanted too love this place. I wanted it to be the place I go to on the regular. I wanted to rave about it but unfortunately that isn't going to happen today. \u00a0I also thought it was weird that they don't open until 4pm by then you have lost out on so much business. \u00a0I mean I thought Uncle John's opening up at 1 pm was crazy but Uncle Don Ray's opening at 4pm is a head scratcher.The first time I went to Uncle Don Ray's BBQ was on mother's day. \u00a0We asked for the fries to be plain but instead the entire order was but people make mistakes so I didn't give them a ding on messing up our order. \u00a0It was closer to the end of the day and the tips really were more of a \"meh' not \"amazing\"My daughters told me hey it was the end of the night, plus the chicken wings they ordered were good and the hot links were decent even though they were no Uncle John.One day she went back and I don't know the day but the rib tips were still not up to par and the portion was small according to her so I don't know what made her give this place another chance but she loves rib tips and I guess she was going for the three strike rules so she went back this pass Saturday \u00a05/24/14 and the ribs were so flavorful and that's all I could think about was getting my own order because she teased me with only one piece. \u00a0She also said they gave her a free sample of the turkey tips and they were delicious.I went back excited about getting my order only to walk back home to discover they were cold, dried out and less than tasty bits of meat in my container. They were nothing like they were the day before when my taste buds were excited and couldn't wait for more of the savory meat. \u00a0They tasted nothing like they look and I watched as the young man pulled rib tips out of the oven so when did they cook the rib tips? \u00a0how long were they in the oven? \u00a0I don't know why I didn't think of that while I watched him fix my order.While waiting on my order a young lady came into the restaurant and ordered 3 small \"End Pieces\" she also ordered a small link after talking with the young lady behind the counter because there was a bit of confusion on what she meant by \"End Pieces\" \u00a0I asked her what was \"End Pieces\" because I had never heard that term used before in regards to ribs. \u00a0She explained that it was the end of a slab of ribs and too be honest I was still confused because I thought they called that end baby back or something like that. \u00a0Anyway, I watched as the guy prepared her order and from the way she explained what it was it didn't look like the young man understood what she meant either by \"End Pieces\" so I told her I don't think you are going to be happy with your order because he is chopping the meat into tiny pieces and you said it was suppose to have a bone in it like a slab. \u00a0She went back to the window asked the lady behind the counter was she sure they knew what \"End Pieces\" meant and the young man assured her he did and the young lady told her she would show her the order before they wrapped it up and gave it to her. \u00a0Just as I had expected that wasn't what she wanted but I didn't stay too see the final results so I can't say if things were resolved or if she cancelled her order. \u00a0It was messed up because she drove all the way from Oak Park thinking she was coming to Uncle John's and got Uncle Don Ray's. It would have been okay if she had a better experience.If you go into this place envisioning what use \u00a0to be there you are going to be more disappointed because this place doesn't hold a candle to them.At the end of the day I will go back to try the turkey tips and if I want some wings I will go there but I can live without their Hot Links and inconsistent, small serving yet expensive tips.

I decided to take my chances and walk in with no appointment on a Sunday afternoon and glad I did cause I walked right in with no wait time. I needed to get a pedicure and no chip manicure done. Normally, for a no chip manicure and regular pedicure I am looking at $50. Very standard throughout most nail salons + tip. I have to say that their selection of nail polish was very small. They started me with the pedicure and the only thing I have to say was interesting, was the hot rocks they used to rub my feet with for a short minute. They also cover your heels with a plastic baggy filled with some type of soaking soap water. Nonetheless, I felt my pedicure was a bit fast. I don't feel that the girl doing my pedicure took her time filing my feet the way she should have. I could care less for the hot rocks and the plastic baggy. I would rather have a good foot file. She did a very good job on the nail polish. For a $30 pedicure... Umm. Not 100% satisfied.. Maybe 75%. This is normally $20 anywhere else. \u00a0For the no chip manicure, they use the Shellac nail polish. It's looks nice, but for those that had it done before, it's nothing out of the ordinary from a regular nail polish.. other than using the ultra violet nail light to make it stronger. The color I picked was a very light hot pink, so because my nails were not filed properly, I have small bumps showing through. A good nail salon knows to always paint the tips of your nails as well so they don't chip easily. Unfortunately for me, I was not one of the lucky ones to get that service and a day later after having my nails done, it's starting to chip off a little bit at the tips. I was busy watching tv, and did not pay attention to what was going on in front of me. For a $40 no chip manicure... Umm. Not 100% satisfied. Maybe 60%. This is normally $30 anywhere else. Fot the prices this salon charges for services, I would think they would be more up to date with their decor, paint, and service. The television does not help the experience either. I don't understand why it had to be so loud. I prefer spa music to relax to, not a chaotic television show that I don't care for. It's silly to think that I spent so much money on my no chip to have to do it all over again most likely in a week. Sorry Jewel Nail Spa.

She did not scrub or buff my feet for the pedicure. When she finally started polishing, when she messed up, she would dig into my skin with her NAIL to fix it; very unprofessional. What I did like about the pedicure is that they put paraffin bags on your heels when they're done with the pedicure, which most salons charge $10-$15 extra to do so. \u00a0When we FINALLY got to the manicure, I asked her if she had time to do a french manicure instead. She rolled her eyes and simply said \"Yes.\" Once again, she was kind of rough with my fingers, didn't even ask if I wanted round or square and she was fixing the polish with her nails. She put some lotion and hit my hands twice, which I'm really hoping is NOT the massage they give out to their clients. I specifically told her that I want a WHITE BASE for my french manicure, I do not like pink at all. She got me a clear base! She put the base on and started doing the lines, no brush, nothing. The lines were so crooked! When I saw her grab the base again, I asked her if I can have something more white. She stared and me and spoke her language to her co-workers. She said \"I do line again,\" which I replied to \"I don't need you to repeat the white line, I would like something more white on the base.\" She got really frustrated and stood up and started talking her language with her co-workers again. A younger lady came and asked me what I would like, I explained again and she brought me a couple of choices, very nice and smiley girl. The older woman came back and did it, its not bad for a french mani (I asked her if she can fix the white line, to which she used her fingers again, but its not bad),but overall I was very dissatisfied. The lines aren't all the same width and they are thick, so they will definitely chip fast. If you want a cheap mani/pedi and you don't care if the technicians are talking in their language the whole time, getting up all the time to reply to their texts and answer the phone, not talk to you AT ALL and not understand when you ask them something, you can go.

He didn't give my feet time to soak, he half-assed scrubbed my feet. He half-assed used the hot stones and paraffin wax on my feet and quickly applied the polish. Additionally, my no chip manicure should have been a regular polish. Two days later the \"no chip\" polish came off two of my nails. It's disappointing, especially when I paid $50 for a service that was crappy. I thought the no chip mani and pedi were going to last because my friends raved about no chip manis and I wanted to try one (they've been to better places and those places were not Jewel Nail Spa). I should of known after I looked around the salon and other folks were getting better service and treatment than me. Jewel Nail Spa will never get anymore of my money because the quality of their service is poor and the treatment you receive is not equal.

I sprinkled some of my Parmesan cheese on my Jerk Q and I was in heaven the cheese cooled down some of the heat from Jerk and also gave it a bit of a pop in flavor on my dancing taste buds.The owner was cool and it seems like the regulars really like him and we can see why because he was very nice and answered all of our questions about the different flavors that he created.I like that on Monday you can get the wingz for .50 each. On Tuesday they have a wingz challenge and if you can eat their hotess wingz they will give you up to $50 dollars depending on how many wingz you eat.(Now I don't know how long this deal is going to last but it was going on when I was last there.) \u00a0Another thing that makes this owner stand out is that on Sunday from 12-2 they have a homeless special where they give out free wingz.

I just have a bad experience with the male bartender EVERY time I encounter him. \u00a0I typically come on Friday or Saturday nights, but I went on a Tuesday night this last time, since the NBA finals game 6 fell on a Tuesday. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ok, so usually I avoid the light skinned male bartender at all costs and order drinks from any of the ladies that are always pleasant to deal with - heck they even speak and smile when they see me (yes I tip well)! So this night one of my friends (didn't know any better) asks HIM to make our drinks. \u00a0And since she was dealing with HIM directly and I wanted to see his attitude with her, I waited for the conversation to unfold naturally. She ordered her drink, and he came back with it and she proceeded to order 2 more drinks (mine and another friend of ours) he immediately snapped and told her to hurry up and she should have ordered all the drinks at one time! WOW.. \u00a0She brushed it off & ordered the drinks. \u00a0I watched him across the bar make my drink with Patron instead of Don Julio (which is what she ordered for me). He also poured the other drink wrong too! \u00a0When he came over to us with the drinks she told him the errors and he said ok I'll remake the margarita, but you ordered this other drink wrong, and that's not my fault. O_O \u00a0I leaned in to tell him she wanted the Jack Daniels Honey instead of the reg Jack and could he be so kind to take care of that - he snapped at me and said she ordered this wrong, and next time maybe you should order your own drink! (FLOORED) I told him this was not my drink the margarita was, and as a matter of fact I don't even need you to remake my drink. \u00a0 \u00a0 He immediately threw the incorrect Patron drink down the sink and said, \"No problem!\" (body language said the rest) I said to him, \"You are very rude\" and he said he didn't care! \u00a0I couldn't believe it! So he made her pay for the wrong Jack and when she asked for a glass of water he ignored her and walked back and forth past her w/o acknowledging her request ever! \u00a0I was so pissed at how rude he was, right in front of other customers too! \u00a0I walked away and ordered my drink from the lady on the opposite side of the bar - always pleasant. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Its sad to see a nice establishment with rude employees. \u00a0This is the type of thing that can make or break a business. \u00a0Customers are your paycheck! \u00a0You have to be accommodating to people paying their money - or they will go to a place that WILL accommodate them. \u00a0I hope the owner/management speaks to this man and he gets his act together, or let him go already!

For reasons totally unbeknownst to me. \u00a0It's only an okay job, but for two hours of back and forth over the same ten nails, no toes included, I'm expecting the best manicure ever. Nope. Plus, the polish seemed to be pretty clumpy. I should've run when I noticed that in the first place. They give you so many reasons to strike them out as a go to nail salon. I walked in asking how much they charged for a no chip. I was told $35. Cool, because that's less than what I normally pay. However, when I got ready to pay I was told $40, but they would only charge the 35 this time. Next time I'd be charged 40 unless I signed up for a membership. I wish the hell I would!The lady that did my nails spoke very little English so the communication barrier became a huge issue every time I asked her anything. I wanted my nails rounded. She did it upon the first filing, then after she finished both hands, she went back to clipping the nails on the previous hand in square fashion. I had to 'show' her that one hand was rounded and now she'd turned the other one square. Which made no sense because now she was clipping and filing again to make them even...and shorter. Meanwhile, time is flying by and I'm looking at my watch like what the heck lady? It was like she was an OCD polisher because she just kept going back and forth....I mean way more than what's typically normal. I watched two people get finished up with their nails and two people start up before I left. The people that left came after I did. What's wrong with this picture? You're in downtown Chicago. The ideal woman/customer is trying to come in and get out during a lunchbreak. I started getting frustrated. Then it doesn't help, as I saw in another review, when they come around and 'tell' you that you need brow service. I don't even know how well you do with brows and so far I'm not impressed with the nail service so no thank you! She was pretty in your face about it too. Go away! She was also the translator so she came back more times than I expected I would see her. When I told my tech to stop polishing after she was slowly revving up to put on my third (felt like eighth) coat off polish, she didn't understand and the translator had to come back and tell her to put on my finishing coat. Finally! But translator tech sees my frustration and I guess in an attempt to smooth things over keeps telling me my nails are pretty and it's a nice job, wanting me to affirm same. I don't care at this point. I want to leave. She goes away and my tech completes the final polish. But then she wants to do the hand massage. Please spare me lady! So I had to tell her no thank you on that part and she smiled and tried to do it anyway. Annoying!

I purchased the no chip mani Groupon a while back. Per the instructions on the Groupon, I called last week to make my appointment, noting that I'd be using it as payment. I showed up 10 minutes ahead of time and an employee who was working on someone else asked how she could help me. I began saying \"I have an appointment at 6...\" when she cut me off, telling me to \"go sit over there\" and pointed to the opposite side of the room. About 10 minutes later, she dropped a box full of nail samples in front of me and told me to choose a color, walking away again. The next time she passed, I asked her if it would be alright to put my tip on a card (although I brought cash, just in case). She responded, \"next time bring cash.\"I'm not easily offended, so none of these things are what pushed me to give this place such a poor rating. I was turned away for no good reason. After conferring amongst themselves, a different employee came by and stated \u00a0they will not honor a valid Groupon. According to them, they \"stopped working with Groupon\" and I would need to figure out how to get a refund myself. I asked for the employees name so that I could reference it when I spoke with Groupon and he refused, handing me a business card and walking away. It looks like a lot of people have had positive experiences here and but I'm shocked at how awful the customer service was, especially a first time customer. Don't waste a customers time if you don't know your own policies. If you're no longer accepting certain payments, you should be informing customers before they make their way to the appointment.

Maybe people steal polish and this is their solution.I asked them to clean the pedi bowl before putting water in for me. They said they clean after every pedi so I'm waiting to see if that's the case when the next pedi finishes. One plantar's wart was enough. OK, I see a gal cleaning...still playing it safe and not putting my feet down except my heel.I asked the technician to clean the tools before starting. She said she already did but I asked her to do it again. They don't have their tools in disinfectant solution but, rather, just spray the tools with alcohol and wipe them. Ugh.As I look around, this place really is much nicer than Fairy Nails. It's much roomier, there's nice paint on the walls, some spa-like art work and a couple of nice tvs and the smell isn't overwhelming. And, again, it seems to be much, much cleaner.

Her butter cookies remind me of when I was a kid in public school and the lunchroom made the butter cookies.I am so thankful that Miss Karen does not be stingy with the butter in her products I would rather pay a little more money for a high quality product and that is Karen knows how to deliver.Her buttermilk pound cake is heavenly so if you want to treat yourself or treat your sweet to a sweet go see Miss Karen you owe it to yourself and your taste buds.Thank you Ms Karen.
