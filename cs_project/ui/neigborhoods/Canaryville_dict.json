I knew from the minute I walked into this place my search would continue. The owner (Mai) isn't warm at all. She's cold with cut n dry comments. On my first visit it was 3 of us and we were told it would be 30 minutes. We decided to wait, as I looked around I noticed Mai is the ONLY nail tech. And there's 2 techs that does the pedicures. There's 4 nail stations and 3 pedicure stations. 3 hours later I was satisfied with my service. Not impressed but satisfied. They do have OPI and Essie but the colors are VERY limited. They have a verity of colors for the NO CHIP manicures (which is the in thing) tho. But that was ok by me because I've learned to bring my own polish. I decided to go back for my 2 week maintenance and figured out how Mai operates. Because the place is so small and tucked away she doesn't get a lot of business and she remembers her clients. Because on my first time we were new she didn't turn us away but as I sat there and observed her I noticed that if 2 or more ppl came in together she would tell them they're busy and they would need to make an appointment. But if you come in alone she would take you and give you a 20-30 minute wait time. On my second time again, I was satisfied but not impressed so I came back for a third time BAD MISTAKE. Because I've decided to go stiletto after 15 years of wearing natural nails and she's the ONLY nail tech she does my nails while another worker does my pedi. I like one person working on me per visit. Mai doesn't buff the nails enough so no matter what I have dull spots on them. And the pedicure ladies (yep I've had both of them service me) give rush jobs. The polish is sloppy (all over my skin). I had to ask them (all 3 times) to wash the pedi tub. They reuse the toe separators and the pedi shoes (I spoke up and made them open new materials for me). But you BETTER know as soon as you speak up for yourself they speak in their native tongue and all 3 look right in your direction. No shame or discretion at all. Because she turns people away and it's so small that it's quiet and if you like Metv (all throwback shows) then this can be a place for you but if you're a stickler for perfect service DON'T waste your time. And please believe the people raving about this place is more concerned about the $30 Mon-Thurs mani/pedi special.

\u00a0Because there were DEAD flies. \u00a0During my walk-around, I considered moving us to a table by the window with chairs instead of the benches, and that's when I saw the fly graveyard. \u00a0Just tens of large dead flies, belly-up and sitting on the ledge by the window right by the table where people eat their food.And yes, I SAW this and still ATE my food a few minutes later. \u00a0And I waited until AFTER she ate and we left the restaurant to take her back to the outside of the window so she could look in and see what I saw.And again, I'm torn. \u00a0The service was friendly (that we saw). \u00a0The food was tasty (worth coming back for). \u00a0But the cleanliness and atmosphere? \u00a0Atrocious. \u00a0As I told her as we were walking away - maybe I'd consider coming back in the winter. \u00a0I doubt he'd have much heat control, so a seat on the stools by the grill would be warm, and the door would be closed so there'd be no flies.(Oh, and I should mention they're cash only and there's no ATM inside.)So I enjoyed the food and there's a chance we'll be back someday when the conditions are better. \u00a0And frankly, our stomachs are only stronger for what we've been through. \u00a0After all, the only way our bodies can become strong enough to fight off bacteria and infections is to give it lots of practice. \u00a0And that's why I'm still alive.(And if I die soon, someone can please posthumously update my review.)", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 8, 16]}}, "neighborhoods": ["New City", "Canaryville"], "latitude": 41.8091174215078, "longitude": -87.6454858481884, "rating": "3.0", "times": {"Mon": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Thu": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sat": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Wed": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Tue": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sun": ["9:00 am", "3:00 pm"], "Fri": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Burgers", "burgers"]], "address": ["4653 S Halsted St"], "attributes": {"Take-out": "Yes", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "No", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "No", "Delivery": "No", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Attire": "Casual", "Waiter Service": "No", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Drive-Thru": "No", "Good for Kids": "Yes"}, "category": "Restaurants", "number_of_reviews": "3"}, "del-sur-bar-and-grill-chicago": {"comments": {"3": {"description": "Excellent, we had the grilled shrimp with green mole and the ropa vieja with homemade corn tortillas, both dishes were delicious. \u00a0We'll definitely be back.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 23]}, "1": {"description": "Delicious!

I sat down and waited for my appointment time since I arrived a bit early. \u00a0I was called by the technician and sat down in the pedicure chair which was very comfortable. The water was white. So I figured it was some sort of soap for my feet. The pedicure was great. But I noticed that a few minutes later the water was clear. I figured it drained out the soap or something. The only thing I didn't enjoy about the pedicure was that the technician's hands were very cold. Also the lotion she put on my feet was freezing! Not very comforting. I guess this was because the salon was cold to begin with..... During my pedicure another technician started cleaning the station next to me. I noticed she sprayed Scrubbing Bubbles on the bowl and then she sprayed it on the pumice and the other utensil she used to smooth my feet!! She then scrubbed them both with a nail brush. I don't think this is the proper way to clean utensils at all! This lead me to believe that the white water was left over Scrubbing Bubbles.  Then I was moved to the other side of the salon for my manicure, which was even colder!!! The manicure was great but I couldn't enjoy it since it was so cold. And then add on the technicians cold hands and cold lotion. I actually had to ask the technician to stop for a minute while I put my jacket back on. I also found it rude that she was speaking to another technician across the room in their language. I would understand if they are next to each other but not across the room...... Once she finished I went back to the other side to dry my nails. I was acknowledged upon leaving. Which was nice. \u00a0But two days later my nails had already chipped.

I understand wanting to keep the electric bill down, but these girls rely mostly on the natural light which isn't smart when chicago gets bipolar and cloudy. They have tiny lamps for them to work with but when I picked my nail color, it was dim and I picked what looked like a light red. She began removing the current no-chip and placed my hands in weird warm gloves. She said it was to speed up the removal but it didn't do jack. The girl had to scrape my nails like you scrape baked grease off a pan. She began the routine mani steps and I noticed there was 0 water for my hands to be placed in. I hate hate hate these \"dry\" manis. She ends up yanking and cutting hard skin and the results are kinda ugly. Once she painted the nails and asked to put my hands in the UV thingy, the UV apparatus was crusty with previous dried up polish or god knows what. The whole time I prayed I wasn't catching an illness and washed my hands asap. I later walked into my office (with bright lights) and realized I had a freakin' peach colored mani. Peach!

No matter what time of day or night you pass this place there will always be tons of kids with less than a promising future hanging out, people with a very limited budget, as well as police having dinner.The menu is limited, greasy, unhealthy, and not very good. You can get 2 hot dogs, fries, and a Pepsi for under $2.00. The pizza by the slice is available at $1.00 so they actually limit how many slices you can buy. I guess they are worried about a family of 10 coming in and feeding their whole family on slices. The service is ok, no wait staff just a counter where you can place your order. Nothing notable or difficult about ordering slices and dogs. The staff is mostly comprised of Hispanic people in red shirts. Washing your hands before you eat is not necessary as this place lacks the level of cleanliness you would expect from a food service establishment. Forget about using the bathroom unless you want to boot up, snort something, do a drug deal, hide a dead body, or roll a blunt. They do deliver until about 3:00am. If you are hanging out in Canaryville for the night you will notice the delivery cars racing around the streets as this place is actually very popular. Everyone in the neighborhood orders here.This place is not worth a special trip but if you do happen to be in the hood....never mind, do not go here. Your heart and waistline with thank you later on in life.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not going to comment too much on Canaryville as that would take a whole different review but it certainly deserves a small note. Every time I visit for either business or pleasure I am completely intrigued. One thing to comment on is that this part of the world is comprised of mostly white, Irish, White Sox loving born and bred Chicagoans. This is where real \"salt of the earth\" people live. You can actually see hard life on the faces of the people, even children and read them like a book. What is strange is that people that grow up in Canaryville seldom ever leave or move away. When you speak to a resident more times than not they will put down or degrade their own neighborhood, but on the other hand will fist fight or do murder to protect a strange feeling of pride they have. There are gangs here and although they remain in the shadows you may from time to time encounter tactical police officers performing a shakedown on a group of men all around a beat up car. Police scanners are very common place in homes and everyone knows everything about everybody. They do not like outsiders but will tolerate them. This includes black, Hispanic, even me as I am an Italian/English, east coast talking stranger. Driving around this part of the city you will certainly be noticed and accounted for.

The cream cheese filling was alright but the top layer was some weird, gelatinous, lemony stuff. Just ick! Strike one. On the the chocolate croissant.

It wasn't bad - but wasn't as good as I had hoped. I ate it though, but that's because there's a fat girl trapped inside of me that's dying to get out. Strike two. Lastly, the almond croissant. By this time, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. The pastry was flaky and buttery. The almond filling was rich and tasty, and the sliced almonds on top gave it a nice crunch.

I went thinking it was a black-owned business and it's not. Yes, that makes a difference as I'm trying to support this idea because I believe that black-owned businesses can increase stability in a neighborhood. Anyway, the management was rude, referring to me as \"honey\" \"baby\" and other sexist words. As a grown woman, I do not care for strange men to refer to me in such a manner. As I received my order, I got more patronizing comments such as \" I got your back, baby\". What did I need support for? When did picking up a bag of chicken become akin to \"the struggle is real\" slogan?!?! Also, the way the management talked to their employees was disgusting. Who wants to see folks being bossed around like they are dogs or arguing over \u00a0customers food? SMH. I'm not asking for Nirvana but how you treat others certainly says how you feel about people in general. The food was decent. The breading was a bit too dry, with too much black pepper.
