They certainly deserve more attention than this. The menu is far from generic as is its competitors, the Lao empire. There are a vast amount of choices to select from and a few entrees even fared rabbit meat. For two, we shared the shredded pork with jalapeno peppers and spicy lamb with cumin. From the pictures, the lamb appear blazing hot but it's quite the contrary. The jalapeno peppers held most of the heat. Neither dishes sent us running in circles, screaming for water but do prepare yourself with napkins and at least one glass of ice water. They will come in handy. A minor deduction here and there lead to the four-star review. The paper covering our table was stained with grease as was a napkin that they gave us.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 12, 9]}, "29": {"description": "GOOD LUCK FORTUNENo fortune cookie was needed to find this place. It was all good luck. We were starving and had missed lunch. It's was 2pm and we were in Chinatown without a plan. We needed to be in the Gold Coast area by 3:30pm. We knew that our regular Chinese restaurants that we typically eat at were not very fast, so we through caution into the air. There was a parking spot directly in front of this restaurant and I grabbed it. We then saw the 3 red hot chili peppers on the awning and knew this place would be spicy enough for us. Our last check was the Yelp app which showed us a 4 star rating. This must be our lucky day. Look out Mega Millions I'm buying a lottery ticket tonight. \u00a0As I walked up, I loved all of the photos of food on the outside storefront window. Even the Hungry Hound had his headshot plastered on the front door. Honestly has Steve D eaten at every restaurant in Chicago? I'm starting to feel like he is watching me like Santa. Hopefully I'm not on the naughty food list. I loved the interior because it was warm and inviting. We were quickly greeted by Kevin who was also our waiter. Kevin is from a town near Beijing and has been living in Chicago for about a year. He loves his job and he loves the food here. After our lunch we spent some time talking to him and asking him what his favorite dishes were. He listed a whole bunch of his favorites and we are now ready for our next visit. He highly recommended the DanDan Noodles, which is one of my favorites, so I can hardly wait until my return visit. We ordered a cold appetizer of spicy chicken and noodles. It is the first time I've ever ordered cold noodles at a Chinese restaurant and it was really good. The dish was perfect with just the right amount of kick. I wish I had a slice of bread to wipe up all of the delicious chili oil on the bottom of the plate. I will definitely order this dish again. Do you like really spicy food? Then I recommend the Shredded pork with sliced jalape\u00f1o peppers. This Authentic Chinese Dish is from the city of Zigong, the third largest city in the Sichuan province of China. I promise that the dish will hurt you. If I was appearing on an episode of Man vs Food. I would have won at first but hours later the jalape\u00f1os came back roaring and beat me down. Yes food won and as much as I loved this dish I will not be ordering it ever again. The shredded pork was cooked perfectly and there were a ton of long sliced jalape\u00f1os that provided an amazing punch. There were also hints of fresh ginger in the dish. It was good but very spicy. A couple of things that I loved. The rice was free unlike another nearby Sichuan place that charges a $1 per person for rice and was recently shut down by the FBI. This place takes credit cards (see comment above). They also have free hot green tea and it was really good. It was perfect on a cold chilly fall day in Chicago. This may be a new favorite of ours and I can not wait to come back. There was authentic Chinese music playing in the background that went along with the soothing waterfall in the restaurant. I loved the interior which had a great authentic feel on the inside. Throw in some free wifi and I could hang out here all day long. If you do come here check out the walls for great info. There is a board that shows how much they love social media platforms encouraging customers to write reviews. By posting this it shows their confidence in the food they are serving. There was a community board with local info. Another board with letters and reviews written by real customers. It's like a Yelp review of the day but on the wall of the restaurant. There were also various magazine articles and great restaurant awards posted around. All I could see was an owner who cares about his customers, community and business by serving fantastic authentic food. I loved this business from when I first walked in the door and it did not disappoint me. The service and food were incredible and I hope I visit again soon. Chinatown in Chicago is starting to remind me of my trips to Beijing and it's only 3 miles from my house. So I have no excuses not to be a frequent diner here.

I like Yan Bang Cai kinda tone the heaviness of the favoring down a bit because even for local Sichuanese, Zigong food can be too spicy. Before coming in, I have some warnings for you. Don't expect American style Chinese food here (I don't know why would someone come to Chinatown for that. Panda Express has all they want). Don't expect food placed in fancy bone china and decorate too nicely. Food is priced quite cheaply here and appetizer portion is close to Entree size. If someone still want more than that, go out and turn left to Lao series restaurants. I usually roll my eyes when someone brings up Lao Sichuan after I mentioned that I grew up in Sichuan.I wouldn't say everything dish is equally good (I don't think any restaurant is like that).

Where is my first stop? CHINATOWN! I take every opportunity to get authentic Chinese food which is hard to come by in the city I currently live in. Yea I know I'm so Chinese, lol! I had heard a lot about another restaurant Lao Sze Chuan in Chinatown but after reading mixed reviews, I decided to come to Yan Bang Cai instead. I parked just outside the restaurant on the street with no problem. Parking is $2 per hour which seems to be the norm in Chicago. The restaurant was very clean and well decorated. It was quite empty during lunch hour on a Thursday when I visited. Being the only customer, I was able to chat quite a bit with the server in Mandarin. She told me because of the Chinatown location most ppl live nearby are Chinese. Chinese ppl don't like spending money so they usually bring lunch to work and that's why there aren't many customers for lunch. But it usually gets very busy at dinner time. Hmm, that makes sense. Guess I'm not so Chinese after all b/c I eat out all the time, lol! She also told me the owner/chef came from Sichuan province in China so the dishes are very traditional Sichuan style. I studied the menu for a bit and ordered the pork in garlic sauce (Yu Xiang Rou Si) and a cold dish appetizer beef slice in chili sauce (Fu Qi Fei Pian). My order came quickly. And the portion was big enough for two people to share. I have to say the beef slice in chili sauce was the BEST! It was very authentic and addicting! I highly recommend it if you like spicy dishes! It was just like the flavor you would taste in China. The pork in garlic sauce was good but not great. I don't think I would order it again. But then again I think I might have ordered the wrong dish b/c it isn't really a Sichuan speciality to begin with. I'll deff have to try something else next time. My server was nice and attentive. My bill came to be around $18 plus tip. It was a bit steep for one person but I think it is actually reasonable if you consider the portion of the dishes.

Our server told us the chef has 6 restaurants in Michigan and this is his first venture in Chicago (so he definitely has his shit down). Our server made great recommendations on the following: Sichuan style small plate chicken: Winner winner chicken dinner, this dish definitely stole the show. A complex stew of bone-in chicken, carrots, potatoes, and hand pulled noodles in a sichuan pepper curry broth, this was unlike anything I've eaten before, and tasted like Mom made it. This is a must-try!Rabbit & Chili peppers (cold) & Dan Dan noodles: we had these as appetizers and both were greatly flavored without being too spicy Zigong salt miner eggplant: I always associate Sichuan food with eggplant, and this eggplant was perfectly fried, light creamy texture and dusted with cumin & sichuan spicesSquirrel fish in two sauces: This was a really interesting dish in that two fish filets were fried and covered in two sauces, one sweet & vinegary, another chili based. This is a great option if you like heavier sauces with fish Pork belly & bamboo shoots: Although this dish was tasty (how could pork belly not be?)

The decor is unique, service pretty decent, food came out fast and hot, and prices are a little on the high side for Chinatown (closer to suburban pricing). The flavors are pretty good, but doesn't seem too distinguished from other similar restaurants - for one that boasts several pages on their menu about regional specialties. With that said, they do have a wide variety of spicy dishes that come in a good portion size with nice presentation. But really nothing stands out that would really pull me away from one of Tony's restaurants.Here are some of my notes on specific dishes:Song's Three-Bean and fish soup: Nice light soup with pea shoots and seasoned with just the right amount of white pepper. The fish is tender and lightly flavored. A bit pricey for a soup that doesn't contain more complexity and body.Quick-fried Seven-step duck: Probably the most skillfully prepared dish I tried. With the multiple cooking steps, in the end it tastes something like a mix between twice cooked pork and smoked duck with tender meat witht he flavors of onion and jalapeno coming through strongly. However, chopping it into pieces rather than slicing in a way to minimize the inconvience of bones while eating really took away from a great dish.Spicy cumin lamb: The lamb and its marination are flavorful and tender - salty with a light aroma. The cumin here is definitely noticable but not robust like preparations you find elsewhere although the flavor of the garlic was nice and strong. Not too spicy and good for a nice meal in the winter.Zigong Salt Miners Spicy Pork: The pork has a bouncy texture and the pepper flavor is noticable, however this dish really could've had stronger and more distinctive flavors.Crispy eggplant in fragrant sauce: The batter for the eggplant was definitely crispy, however it was fried fluffy like what you find in a Chinese Buffet rather than using a nice thin tempura-like batter. The eggplant flavor itself was barely noticable although the sweet vinegar sauce tasted great with the batter.Squirrel-shaped fish w. two flavors: Comes in two flavors. The orange sauce is tongue-numbing spicy but really has little depth to it. The brown sauce is a sweet vinegar. Both pieces of fish looked great with a real flower next to it, but it did not come out crispy at all.Pork belly with mustard greens: Pork belly come out very tender with a great amount of fat on it. But this dish tastes exactly the same as any other preparation in Chinatown for the same dish. I would've preferred maybe to see a slightly different type of pork used or a regional flair to it.Glutinous rice balls w. sesame stuffing: Strong egg flavor balanced with a light wine. A little on the sweeter side but not excessively so. Light hint of ginger and good body to the soup. The sesame filled rice balls are soft and provide just the right amount of chewiness. This one was the best executed dish of the ones I tried.In summary, the food here is pretty good however I put it at 3 instead of 4 stars because of its prices for the quality, lack of uniqueness, and inconsistent execution accross dishes.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 11, 28]}, "7": {"description": "As I write this, 4 hours later, I am still traumatized.Came in on a slow night, sat down, saw the menu that seemed pretty unique.

It will probably take me a solid year to do this but its okay.Location: Yan Bang Cai, with its loud moniker, had been on my radar for a few weeks. Located right on Cermak it is hard to miss. I decided to try all of the most popular restaurants first before trying the not so popular. Decor: Not too sure why I got a Hawaiian vibe from the interior of this place but it was still cool. There were lots of news articles on the walls. Thank God for the pictures though, because the majority of them were not in English. So I couldn't read them if I wanted to. Not too sure what the restaurant looks like in the middle dining section, but in the very front, it was very quaint.Food: Okay. I have such a huge issue with the menu and the food here. First of all, like the articles on the wall, everything was illegible - aside from a very basic description of the dish. It is a very uninspiring menu as well. Personally I am the type of food snob where I want the menu to motivate me to eat. YBC's did not. Because I could not really read the menu, I went with a chicken dish because I did not want to waste money experimenting with a dish where I was unsure of what was included. I ordered the spicy sichuan chicken dish. While the chicken was fantastic, WHY did they serve me a huge plate full of chilis?! I was not thrilled. Because no human being in their right mind would eat a plate of chilis with chicken on the side. Unless, of course, they had a death wish. There were times when I would bite the seeds of the chilis and my mouth would inflame. It was very uncomfortable. From that point I ordered egg rolls.

Our meal was amazingly flavorful, well executed, and home-y, and it definitely beats going to tourist-ladden Lao Sze Chuan. The food hails from Zigong in the Sichuan province, which is known for their salt mines. Our server told us the chef has 6 restaurants in Michigan and this is his first venture in Chicago (so he definitely has his shit down). Our server made great recommendations on the following: Sichuan style small plate chicken: Winner winner chicken dinner, this dish definitely stole the show. A complex stew of bone-in chicken, carrots, potatoes, and hand pulled noodles in a sichuan pepper curry broth, this was unlike anything I've eaten before, and tasted like Mom made it. This is a must-try!Rabbit & Chili peppers (cold) & Dan Dan noodles: we had these as appetizers and both were greatly flavored without being too spicy Zigong salt miner eggplant: I always associate Sichuan food with eggplant, and this eggplant was perfectly fried, light creamy texture and dusted with cumin & sichuan spicesSquirrel fish in two sauces: This was a really interesting dish in that two fish filets were fried and covered in two sauces, one sweet & vinegary, another chili based. This is a great option if you like heavier sauces with fish Pork belly & bamboo shoots: Although this dish was tasty (how could pork belly not be?) I probably wouldn't order again since it was just an ok version of pork belly Overall, Yan Bang Cai was a great Sichuan food experience and I will definitely be back to try more.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 9, 7]}, "5": {"description": "GOOD LUCK FORTUNENo fortune cookie was needed to find this place. It was all good luck. We were starving and had missed lunch. It's was 2pm and we were in Chinatown without a plan. We needed to be in the Gold Coast area by 3:30pm. We knew that our regular Chinese restaurants that we typically eat at were not very fast, so we through caution into the air. There was a parking spot directly in front of this restaurant and I grabbed it. We then saw the 3 red hot chili peppers on the awning and knew this place would be spicy enough for us. Our last check was the Yelp app which showed us a 4 star rating. This must be our lucky day. Look out Mega Millions I'm buying a lottery ticket tonight. \u00a0As I walked up, I loved all of the photos of food on the outside storefront window. Even the Hungry Hound had his headshot plastered on the front door. Honestly has Steve D eaten at every restaurant in Chicago? I'm starting to feel like he is watching me like Santa. Hopefully I'm not on the naughty food list. I loved the interior because it was warm and inviting. We were quickly greeted by Kevin who was also our waiter. Kevin is from a town near Beijing and has been living in Chicago for about a year. He loves his job and he loves the food here. After our lunch we spent some time talking to him and asking him what his favorite dishes were. He listed a whole bunch of his favorites and we are now ready for our next visit. He highly recommended the DanDan Noodles, which is one of my favorites, so I can hardly wait until my return visit. We ordered a cold appetizer of spicy chicken and noodles. It is the first time I've ever ordered cold noodles at a Chinese restaurant and it was really good. The dish was perfect with just the right amount of kick. I wish I had a slice of bread to wipe up all of the delicious chili oil on the bottom of the plate. I will definitely order this dish again. Do you like really spicy food? Then I recommend the Shredded pork with sliced jalape\u00f1o peppers. This Authentic Chinese Dish is from the city of Zigong, the third largest city in the Sichuan province of China. I promise that the dish will hurt you. If I was appearing on an episode of Man vs Food. I would have won at first but hours later the jalape\u00f1os came back roaring and beat me down. Yes food won and as much as I loved this dish I will not be ordering it ever again. The shredded pork was cooked perfectly and there were a ton of long sliced jalape\u00f1os that provided an amazing punch. There were also hints of fresh ginger in the dish. It was good but very spicy. A couple of things that I loved. The rice was free unlike another nearby Sichuan place that charges a $1 per person for rice and was recently shut down by the FBI. This place takes credit cards (see comment above). They also have free hot green tea and it was really good. It was perfect on a cold chilly fall day in Chicago. This may be a new favorite of ours and I can not wait to come back. There was authentic Chinese music playing in the background that went along with the soothing waterfall in the restaurant. I loved the interior which had a great authentic feel on the inside. Throw in some free wifi and I could hang out here all day long. If you do come here check out the walls for great info. There is a board that shows how much they love social media platforms encouraging customers to write reviews. By posting this it shows their confidence in the food they are serving. There was a community board with local info. Another board with letters and reviews written by real customers. It's like a Yelp review of the day but on the wall of the restaurant. There were also various magazine articles and great restaurant awards posted around. All I could see was an owner who cares about his customers, community and business by serving fantastic authentic food. I loved this business from when I first walked in the door and it did not disappoint me. The service and food were incredible and I hope I visit again soon. Chinatown in Chicago is starting to remind me of my trips to Beijing and it's only 3 miles from my house. So I have no excuses not to be a frequent diner here.

Where is my first stop? CHINATOWN! I take every opportunity to get authentic Chinese food which is hard to come by in the city I currently live in. Yea I know I'm so Chinese, lol! I had heard a lot about another restaurant Lao Sze Chuan in Chinatown but after reading mixed reviews, I decided to come to Yan Bang Cai instead. I parked just outside the restaurant on the street with no problem. Parking is $2 per hour which seems to be the norm in Chicago. The restaurant was very clean and well decorated. It was quite empty during lunch hour on a Thursday when I visited. Being the only customer, I was able to chat quite a bit with the server in Mandarin. She told me because of the Chinatown location most ppl live nearby are Chinese. Chinese ppl don't like spending money so they usually bring lunch to work and that's why there aren't many customers for lunch. But it usually gets very busy at dinner time. Hmm, that makes sense. Guess I'm not so Chinese after all b/c I eat out all the time, lol! She also told me the owner/chef came from Sichuan province in China so the dishes are very traditional Sichuan style. I studied the menu for a bit and ordered the pork in garlic sauce (Yu Xiang Rou Si) and a cold dish appetizer beef slice in chili sauce (Fu Qi Fei Pian). My order came quickly. And the portion was big enough for two people to share. I have to say the beef slice in chili sauce was the BEST! It was very authentic and addicting! I highly recommend it if you like spicy dishes! It was just like the flavor you would taste in China. The pork in garlic sauce was good but not great. I don't think I would order it again. But then again I think I might have ordered the wrong dish b/c it isn't really a Sichuan speciality to begin with. I'll deff have to try something else next time. My server was nice and attentive. My bill came to be around $18 plus tip. It was a bit steep for one person but I think it is actually reasonable if you consider the portion of the dishes.

I came to this place with a friend looking for the Szechuan place that it replaced, and when we got here on a Sunday for lunch it was empty except for another table. We were apprehensive about the emptiness, but the food is pretty authentic and very good. We ordered a rabbit dish, a small plate chicken, and Szechuan dan dan noodles. Of the three, the chicken was the best. The flavor was very authentic, close to the kind I had in China, and it had delicious handmade noodles at the bottom. The Szechuan dan dan noodles had a good dan dan sauce, but it would've been better with better noodles (ideally handmade with good chew). The rabbit was also well flavored and a bit tougher than the chicken, but I think it's also because rabbit is a tougher meat. Overall I enjoyed all the dishes very much. Keeping in mind that I have pretty high standards for Chinese food (coming from the California Bay Area and having been to China often), this place is pretty authentic. I'm really just nitpicking here. The only main downside is that it's a bit more expensive than Chinese restaurants I'm used to as the portions are rather small, but the flavor makes up for it. This is probably about as authentic and good as you'll get in Chicago.Edit: I've come back way too many times for it to remain 4.5 stars.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 1, 12]}, "4": {"description": "BYOB alert!

The decor is unique, service pretty decent, food came out fast and hot, and prices are a little on the high side for Chinatown (closer to suburban pricing). The flavors are pretty good, but doesn't seem too distinguished from other similar restaurants - for one that boasts several pages on their menu about regional specialties. With that said, they do have a wide variety of spicy dishes that come in a good portion size with nice presentation. But really nothing stands out that would really pull me away from one of Tony's restaurants.Here are some of my notes on specific dishes:Song's Three-Bean and fish soup: Nice light soup with pea shoots and seasoned with just the right amount of white pepper. The fish is tender and lightly flavored. A bit pricey for a soup that doesn't contain more complexity and body.Quick-fried Seven-step duck: Probably the most skillfully prepared dish I tried. With the multiple cooking steps, in the end it tastes something like a mix between twice cooked pork and smoked duck with tender meat witht he flavors of onion and jalapeno coming through strongly. However, chopping it into pieces rather than slicing in a way to minimize the inconvience of bones while eating really took away from a great dish.Spicy cumin lamb: The lamb and its marination are flavorful and tender - salty with a light aroma. The cumin here is definitely noticable but not robust like preparations you find elsewhere although the flavor of the garlic was nice and strong. Not too spicy and good for a nice meal in the winter.Zigong Salt Miners Spicy Pork: The pork has a bouncy texture and the pepper flavor is noticable, however this dish really could've had stronger and more distinctive flavors.Crispy eggplant in fragrant sauce: The batter for the eggplant was definitely crispy, however it was fried fluffy like what you find in a Chinese Buffet rather than using a nice thin tempura-like batter. The eggplant flavor itself was barely noticable although the sweet vinegar sauce tasted great with the batter.Squirrel-shaped fish w. two flavors: Comes in two flavors. The orange sauce is tongue-numbing spicy but really has little depth to it. The brown sauce is a sweet vinegar. Both pieces of fish looked great with a real flower next to it, but it did not come out crispy at all.Pork belly with mustard greens: Pork belly come out very tender with a great amount of fat on it. But this dish tastes exactly the same as any other preparation in Chinatown for the same dish. I would've preferred maybe to see a slightly different type of pork used or a regional flair to it.Glutinous rice balls w. sesame stuffing: Strong egg flavor balanced with a light wine. A little on the sweeter side but not excessively so. Light hint of ginger and good body to the soup. The sesame filled rice balls are soft and provide just the right amount of chewiness. This one was the best executed dish of the ones I tried.In summary, the food here is pretty good however I put it at 3 instead of 4 stars because of its prices for the quality, lack of uniqueness, and inconsistent execution accross dishes.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 11, 28]}, "22": {"description": "The food was fantastic and predictably spicey. \u00a0The place was understaffed for my only visit, which led to some difficulty when ordering a beverage to cool down my mouth. \u00a0I think more people should give Sichuanese food a try!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 12, 8]}, "15": {"description": "Visiting from San Francisco and found this place after reading about it in the NY Times.

I think that makes it hard for me to truly enjoy dim sum unless it's nearly perfect. The way you can be if you see your favorite singer in your favorite opera (or rock concert or whatever you love). Afterwards, you find others just a little wanting.But I decided to put all that aside and settled on a 4 star rating. It's a great introduction to dim sum, with many traditional options, well prepared and fresh. It's a little annoying that the menu with pictures and descriptions doesn't line up with the paper menu you order from (no carts here). But you can just make that into something fun.Take it for what it is, don't expect the absolutely perfection of the cuisine, but do prepare to enjoy yourself and the very reasonable check.I've only ever eaten dim sum here, so can't speak to the rest of the menu.Note: the only way to the restaurant is up quite a long flight of stairs.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 2, 5]}, "13": {"description": "So, when I want to introduce my friends & family to the lovely world of Dim Sum, here's where I bring them.

I am on a mission to try every restaurant in Chinatown. So this was the first time I tried Won Kow. We were shocked that in a restaurant in Chinatown on Sunday, we were the ONLY patrons! Wow. At first that concerned us, but (thankfully) we decided to try it out any way.Location/Decor - I have always enjoyed the decor of all the restaurants in Chinatown. They are all so unique to the other, yet each has their own special aesthetic and opulence. Won Kow seemed a little bit more grand than a few of its sister restaurants. The restaurant is on the second floor which makes for prime people watching down below on the busy Wentworth Avenue. Service - our servers were very prompt. We had one lady handling all of our food items, and one gentleman handling our tea and drinks. Both were very courteous and sincere with their service. They did not hover, but unlike other restaurants in the area, I did not have to hawk them down for a straw or refill. This is probably because we were the only diners in the place. But still. It was awesome.Drinks - the tea was hot and delicious! Very aromatic as well. My friend ordered this huge alcoholic beverage that costed $$ but, but it was huge. She couldn't finish it herself but she really tried! It tasted just like the beach!Food - was pretty impressive! We ordered egg rolls, pot stickers, walnut shrimp, and general tao's chicken. * Egg Rolls- I have definitely had better, but they were still great. It is kind of hard to screw up egg rolls, especially in Chinatown, but again, I have had better. I think the problem I had was that these did not seem as juicy as others I have had. Like, there wasn't any juicy shrimp or chicken or pork inside. the meat was dry. But still good. 3 stars.*Potstickers - hands down the BEST potstickers in Chinatown. period. 5 stars. Talk about juicy! These were not all the way fried. They were lightly fried, so mostly steamed. Absolutely perfect! When mixed with the various sauces on the table...oh my gosh. Heavenly.* Walnut Shrimp - very tasty! The broccoli was on point! The shrimp were huge and plump! The sauce was very unique! Coconuty-mayo flavored but hard to explain. Paired with the candied walnuts...it made a very great dish. 5 stars.* General Tao's Chicken - was supposed to be spicy but it wasnt.

Won Kow also has jumped on the cilantro bandwagon, and our experience there today was very disappointing. Some people don't mind the taste of cilantro, but some of us are sensitive to it and it really ruins the dish. (I've been told there's a genetic element to those of us who find that cilantro enhances, or destroys, a recipe.) It has a \"soapy\" flavor, and if it's in EVERYTHING, you can't just avoid selections that are likely to have it. You're really limited. My husband is not a picky eater, but he dislikes cilantro, and he was not able to tolerate several of his old standby dim sum choices today.The service was also weirdly slow, unusual for Won Kow. I think they were short-handed and had to call in reinforcements, because when we arrived, there was practically no one else in the place, and it took forever to get our food. Then, suddenly, they had enough servers.We always order a LOT of dim sum, but it occurred to us today that we never check what we actually get against the order sheet. That's usually not a big deal, but today it seemed like we were missing several dishes but had extras of food we don't remember ordering.

At this point, I realized she had given me the wrong order, and I didn't want the soup anyway, given how nasty the main dishes were. I just wanted to leave. And leave we did. We did not tip.

Super lame.So the waitress returns with the revised check. Guess what? STILL wrong! Now it came to $18.30. 5+0 still equals 0. But we gave up and paid and left. Another star off for being stupid.

We have been coming to Won Kow for many years, and, it is in fact the oldest Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, and for good reason. Won Kow offers a large menu, and unlike some restaurants, every item on their menu is delectable. The portions are large, and every time we go, we leave full, and with plenty to take home and enjoy later. The cocktails at Won Kow are especially great, and they are hand-prepared. Some of the cocktails are presented in large, ceramic bowls with tropical detail, and served with a flaming center. You get long straws so that you can drink from the large bowls without having to lean over the drink too, it's a very fun experience. When we have visitors in from out of town, we bring them here, and every time, they are blown away by the food. The service is outstanding as well, and David Hoy, the manager, is a warm presence, and generally goes from table-to-table to check on diners to make sure everything is to their satisfaction; he also makes the cocktails when he's there, which is very often. There are several dishes that my wife and I order repeatedly, like the Steamed Sole, which was first recommended to us by David. It is a whole fish, and it is prepared exquisitely well so that it is incredibly tender, and the bones pull out from it so you can just enjoy the meat. Depending on what your tastes are, there is something on their menu that you will love. The atmosphere is warm, with paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling, and the larger tables have lazy Susan's in the center so that food can easily be shared with the entire table. The soups are stellar, and the tea is great, and abundant. The clientele is very diverse, and with many regulars. The Sizzling Beef is extraordinarily good, as are all of the seafood and chicken dishes. I love their Cuttlefish dishes, which are truly delicacies. The wait staff is attentive, but doesn't bother you while you're eating. The prices are also outstanding considering the quality and size of the portions. We try to go here at least once a month, but sometimes we go weekly when we have the ability.

She took our order right away, but our drinks never arrived. Our appetizers came out right away, which was fortunate because we were famished. But still no drinks. A family of 4 was seated at one point near us and got their drinks and dinner before we did. We saw the older man who was tending bar leave that station and start seating people, leaving the wait staff to make their own drinks. \u00a0Our drinks finally arrived at what seemed like an hour after we sat down. \u00a0Our food showed up a half an hour after that.

If you had to rely on public transportation to get to Chinatown, I wouldn't recommend walking from the Chinatown red line stop. It's about 10-15min one way, and that's not bad.

It's 100 cookies for 5 or 6 bucks. Pretty good price for fresh almond cookies. Though when the customer fill into the store, there can be a bit of a traffic jam when people inside decide to \"double park\" in the middle of a busy intersection with their carts!

There is a lot of truck traffic to when people drop off inventory or pick up almond cookies. Once the 15/20 spots fill up, you have to either wait around for someone to move or park on the street, which is no biggie. It's like Chinatown, your horn is useless.

Eventually, they handed one to me. The man said we'd need a knife to split it. I asked if they had one I could use, and he said no. I saw some plasticware behind the counter, and I asked if I could have a plastic knife. The man said he would not give me a knife, and the woman tossed a fork into my bag.

We really had a hard time deciding what to order, considering we were going to being splitting it 3 ways. We finally went with a slice of chocolate cake because it looked amazing.My 4 star review is for the staff here. They were so nice and kind to us. \u00a0They went out of there way to make us feel welcome. I could feel the customer service in the air and I love that. I should have asked them to make a few recommendations but we went on our own limb and that's our own fault. We took our cake to go even though there were plenty of places to sit inside. Then found a bench outside and sat down to dive into our slice of cake. I will say that the chocolate cake was very dry. But I can not give a low star rating to a sweet small family business because I chose the one wrong dessert. Maybe this is how chocolate cake is prepared in China? There were so many dessert items to choose from. Next time I will do a little research before going in here. In fact, I didn't even check Yelp before I walked in. I see now that many of my fellow Yelper friends have eaten here. I also now know what I should have ordered. Sometimes being spontaneous doesn't work out well but I tried. \u00a0I will say that my wife & I were one bite and done with the chocolate cake. Now our little one devoured it. We were suppose to share it but she didn't stop to offer us a second bite. Kids love chocolate deserts no matter what.

Always remember the sense of adventure, when eating at a new place. And always be respectful of other cultures because it may not taste good to you in America but it could be amazing on the other side of the world.

I was meeting up with my pal specifically to obtain for him (if samples proved good) a week's supply of baozi (or char sui bao), BBQ pork in steamed buns. My pal had happened on an online one-person survey of (what the author called) the \"best\" BBQ pork buns in Chicago's Chinatown. That person also happens to have reviewed the Wentworth original of Captain Caf\u00e9 here on Yelp. That reviewer's credentials for passing judgement on this favorite bakery item are dubious and his method is full of holes, but according to him, Captain was his favorite in the area. Since my pal had other business in Chinatown Square, we wound up in this offshoot of Captain Caf\u00e9. First bad sign: no steamed version of BBQ pork buns at Captain, just the egg-glazed baked variety (not our favorite and made in a totally different method using different ingredients). But we were game (and it was pouring rain outside). I also ordered a custard tart and a winter melon cake (\"wife\" cake). Second bad sign: we told the cashier we would eat them there. She bagged up our order. After we reminded her, she gave us a tray. Third bad sign: a non-descript tea was served to us in styro cups at the cashier counter and no pot was brought to the table nor refills ever offered. Straws that broke the camel's back: the filling of the BBQ pork buns was paste-like and unlike anything we had ever been served inside a bun in any other place. Any chunks of actual pork were few and far between. This was a bun that we essentially gagged down because we had already paid for them, not for enjoyment. This was on a Tuesday. Maybe things are different at a different time or at their Wentworth original? Conclusion: don't trust one-person surveys (even my single review).The winter melon cake was equally bad and nonrepresentative of better ones we've had at other bakeries there (Chiu Quon or Wan Shi Da bakeries, both on Wentworth and where their steamed bao are excellent). It's crust layer popped off as we ate it because the entire cake (about 4-in. diameter, 1/2-in. thick) was too moist and not flaky.Still seeking a white, fluffy, steamed BBQ pork bun in Chinatown Square, we dodged water puddles and went across the mall to Saint Anna's bakery a few door up from Captain. They too featured the glazed, baked variety. Less prominent in their cases were smaller, steamed pork buns with that multi-opening look that bespeaks a less confident baker's hand and recipe for the closed-domed finest of the wonderful buns elsewhere.

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but sadly I had to knock it down to 4 due to service/wait time.I'll start with the good:We came in early in the evening and got a table with no problem. We ordered right away and the food came out pretty quickly. (There was a mix-up with our order but we managed to catch it on the ticket before the food came out and the server was sweet about it.)Now, the food was FANTASTIC! It was every bit as good as I remembered it from the food court, and it looked like quite a few new options had been added to the menu. Despite the absurdly long wait (more on that later), I still thought it was all well worth it because the dumplings were just so damn delicious. The price is a bit higher than the food court, but that's to be expected given the added overhead of a restaurant and still very much worth it. As a huge Northern Chinese food snob, I'm really excited to finally have a decent dumpling place in Chicago! Definitely my go-to dinner place in Chinatown from now on.Now the bad:About 10 minutes after getting our food, we decided we wanted a second serving of dumplings and placed the order with our server. A few minutes after this, a big rush of people came in and the restaurant was filled to capacity. We sat around waiting for 10+ minutes before the server came by and asked if we were ready for the bill. I reminded her of our second order and she-clearly having forgotten about it-rushed off to print out a second ticket. At this point, she tells us that it'll be a bit of a wait before our food comes out. Well the wait turned out to be a FULL HOUR between when we placed the second order and when the food actually came out. I assume they ran out of dumplings and had to make a whole new batch, in which case they really should've given us a better estimate of the wait time! By the time our food came out, our parking was about to expire so we scarfed down our piping hot dumplings (burning my tongue along the way), rushed to pay the bill, and ran out of there. Our server was very apologetic, which is why I'm not more mad, but boy.

I can't remember the first time well because I was with a big group and the food was not the center of attention, but I think I was satisfied. This post addresses the second time, when I had a terrible experience. I added an extra star to reflect an average of these two occasions. -------------------------------My family went to this restaurant some time ago and we were quite disappointed. The food was ok to mediocre, but service was extremely poor. I rarely reduce my rating for service unless it is noticeably bad, but this was one of those exceptional cases. I think that because we went during a long weekend, the customer volume was high and the waiters were over-worked. One of the guys looked like he already swore to leave the labor force forever once his shift was over. While busy season is not really an excuse for a restaurant to ignore service quality, I did cut them some slack. The first problem was our soup. We got a pickled cabbage soup, but a few minutes later, the waiter came out with a spinach soup, saying that there was no more cabbage soup and proceeded to convince us that there was not much difference between the two anyhow. Of course, you don't need to know anything about Chinese cuisine to figure out that this persuasion was doomed to fail, and we refused the soup altogether. Next we got a braised chicken dish that we never ordered. We got to keep it - I always love free food - but I had to imagine that some other group was going to become very upset...Our snow pea leaves then came and they didn't look right. Usually, they are dark green and leafy, but these were light green and consisted purely of stems that were hard to chew. If you search \"snow pea leaves\" on google, you'll see pictures of this beautiful, luscious dish, mmmmm. But we were not granted this pleasure. They were nearly inedible (my Chinese parents then said something about the ambiguity of the word \u8c46\u82d7 (dou miao) that could have caused this discrepancy, but I barely know the language; please don't judge if you speak fluent Mandarin). The one other dish we ordered was nothing remarkable, but it was correct. I don't want to write any lies, and so will not try to name the dish. Besides that, the second floor seating area (which is more of an annex, for when the first-floor area is filled) has no foyer, so every time someone enters the restaurant, you'll be greeted with a blast of air. In the winter, beware. At least ask to sit away from the entrance if possible. It was in the low 30s and blustery when we went, so you can imagine how pleased we were to get that free air-conditioning in the wrong season.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 12, 11]}, "47": {"description": "I truly find this place delicious and I wouldn't mind to come here again.

And thanks to checking in on Yelp, we got an extra order for free! The Mongolian beef was the highlight of the meal. Steak, green onion, mushrooms, and onions were stir-fried in a garlic and ginger sauce. I would definitely order this again. The dry chili chicken is tremendous, but you better like some spice. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, so I was more than pleased. The shrimp fried rice was a very good standard rice dish. We also got a seafood stir fry with shrimp, scallops, and squid. Plus, we had a side of Szechuan veggies. Both dishes had that clear broth, which we really don't care for. The seafood, in particular, tasted like it was steamed or boiled instead of having that nice sear which I really enjoy when I eat Chinese food. Both those dishes were pretty disappointing.

And that says a LOT because I have eaten Chinese food, at one time in my life, for 7 days straight. After all these years of thinking I've experienced the best, I hadn't. Until now. When the menu says spicy, it MEANS spicy.

My nasal cavity was leaking 1/3 of the way in and I had to stop. I was so depressed, because I wanted to finish, but I couldn't. It was amazing. Those pot stickers...superb. Moist, savory, just the perfect appetizer. I LOVED the garlic infusion with the spicy cabbage. It was the first \"taste\" when I bit into a few pieces. This too was SPICY. The ONLY reason why I simply cannot give the restaurant 5 stars is because ( as most everyone else has said ) the service lacks in comparison to the great food. I had to wave down 3 different people for a straw, to take my order, a refill, the bill, a box. Had the service rivaled the food, I would have given LSC a 5 star review. But this food. Was heavenly.

First up is Lao Sze Chuan, arguably the cornerstone of Chicago's traditional Chinatown. It's also the crown jewel of the soon-to-be-defunct Tony Hu \"Lao\" empire that seemingly occupies every other square foot of Chinatown--Hu's intent is to sell most of his properties and refocus on the Lao Sze Chuan brand. Of course, you're not concerned about all that busy-ness, so let's get onto the food.If you like spicy food (and you probably should if you're searching for Sichuan cuisine), Lao Sze Chuan is the place for you. Your options are not exactly limited to hot and hotter, but most of the best stuff trends that way. Nevertheless, I'll present you with a nice menu to give you the non-hot optionality.The mapo tofu is a signature dish here, and it's very, very good. It's surprisingly vegetarian, though a ground pork option can be added. For those that haven't had mapo tofu, it's basically tofu in a black bean sauce. Lao's is, of course, the traditional sichuan style and heavily doused in the peppercorn chili oil that signifies the regional cuisine. Base spiciness of this dish isn't as hot as others (like the forthcoming dish) but still packs a kick for the uninitiated.If you want spicier, try the dry chili chicken. You can't mask the chilis in this dish, since they're cut and intermingled throughout tasty pieces of popcorn-fried chicken bits. Helpful hint: the chilis aren't there for eating.Looking for a a milder chicken dish? The three cups chicken (\"san bei ji\") is for you. Rather than using chili oil, this dish focuses on the Asian triumvirate of soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil. There's more of a sauce base as well to douse on your rice. Also note that the chicken is bone-in. It's a nice complement to mapo tofu, in that you can sauce your white rice with both a sweet and a spicy element.Finally for some greens, go with the deep fried green beans. Lao gives you the option of spicing it up (see the dry chili chicken section) or with the traditional, non-spicy version. It's a nice, semi-healthy break from the other, rich dishes.Contrary to what you might have heard in the news, cockroaches are not on the menu (even if they may be in the kitchen).

The complimentary spicy cabbage was nice, sort of like a milder kimchee, and the $2.50 spring rolls we got free with the Yelp check-in (after the server looked frightened, said she had to ask her manager about, and ran off to do so-twice, making us wait in between, but finally brought) were fine but just like Panda Express, nothing special. But they were cancelled out by the unexpected $2.00 charge for white rice, that we didn't order or expect to be charged for, but which normally comes with any large dish at a Chinese restaurant, and which had either some undercooked or overcooked grains of rice in it. This was my second time here, accidentally, and the last time was about equally ok, but with worse service that time. So next time I'll probably go to any of the other 100 Chinese places around there, maybe one with a delicious duck hanging in the window. They do have a large selection of what appeared to be authentic (and rather scary) Chinese dishes so it's probably a good place to go for that.

First up is Lao Sze Chuan, arguably the cornerstone of Chicago's traditional Chinatown. It's also the crown jewel of the soon-to-be-defunct Tony Hu \"Lao\" empire that seemingly occupies every other square foot of Chinatown--Hu's intent is to sell most of his properties and refocus on the Lao Sze Chuan brand. Of course, you're not concerned about all that busy-ness, so let's get onto the food.If you like spicy food (and you probably should if you're searching for Sichuan cuisine), Lao Sze Chuan is the place for you. Your options are not exactly limited to hot and hotter, but most of the best stuff trends that way. Nevertheless, I'll present you with a nice menu to give you the non-hot optionality.The mapo tofu is a signature dish here, and it's very, very good. It's surprisingly vegetarian, though a ground pork option can be added. For those that haven't had mapo tofu, it's basically tofu in a black bean sauce. Lao's is, of course, the traditional sichuan style and heavily doused in the peppercorn chili oil that signifies the regional cuisine. Base spiciness of this dish isn't as hot as others (like the forthcoming dish) but still packs a kick for the uninitiated.If you want spicier, try the dry chili chicken. You can't mask the chilis in this dish, since they're cut and intermingled throughout tasty pieces of popcorn-fried chicken bits. Helpful hint: the chilis aren't there for eating.Looking for a a milder chicken dish? The three cups chicken (\"san bei ji\") is for you. Rather than using chili oil, this dish focuses on the Asian triumvirate of soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil. There's more of a sauce base as well to douse on your rice. Also note that the chicken is bone-in. It's a nice complement to mapo tofu, in that you can sauce your white rice with both a sweet and a spicy element.Finally for some greens, go with the deep fried green beans. Lao gives you the option of spicing it up (see the dry chili chicken section) or with the traditional, non-spicy version. It's a nice, semi-healthy break from the other, rich dishes.Contrary to what you might have heard in the news, cockroaches are not on the menu (even if they may be in the kitchen).

The service sucks, they don't speak very good English, they don't honor the Yelp check in freebies and they forget your orders. \u00a0If that doesn't say Chinese, I don't know what does. LSC was given a Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2012-13 and I'm not surprised that they loss it. Why? Cause they're Chinese and don't give a flying f*ck about no damn Michelin award. I'm part Chinese and I don't give a flying f*ck about awards. \u00a0I only care about direct monetary awards and instant gratification. \u00a0If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense. Anyway, we had a few items on the menu that had me sweating as if I was Jonah Hill taking a walk to the kitchen. 1) Three Cups Chicken - This was a pretty good Three Cups Chicken. The dish was served in a melt pan versus the typical pot associated with the dish. \u00a0The sauce was almost completely absorbed by the chicken. \u00a0There was still a little drip when you went to grab the juicy bits of chicken thighs. \u00a0The combination of sweetness and spiciness was really good. \u00a0It had a crispy texture to it like orange chicken. \u00a0 \u00a02) Dry Chili Chicken - This was probably my favorite dish. \u00a0The taste and texture of the chicken was similar to popcorn chicken but the spices and seasoning was much better. \u00a0The crispy salty batter and the tender juicy pieces of chicken thighs with a sh*t load of dry chili that'll have you sweating like you jumped out of the shower. \u00a0It was an overall good dish to be consume when throwing caution in the wind and forgetting the consequences of tomorrow's bowel movements.3) Boiled Beef - This was my least favorite dish. \u00a0The beef tasted very bland and the soup tasted like it was water topped with chili peppers. \u00a0It wasn't a very exciting dish. \u00a0It seemed like they added the chili peppers to mask the embarrassment of the dish. \u00a0It's kind of like how people in the office always go to a different floor to drop a deuce. \u00a0 Overall, it's a good authentic Chinese restaurant with your typical characteristics like bad service and MSG. \u00a0Did you know MSG is naturally produce in aged beef? \u00a0Now, you know why you get sleepy after having a large piece of steak. Also, you're not a very bright person if you expect good service from an authentic Chinese restaurant. \u00a0You have better chances of winning the lottery. \u00a0Therefore, expecting good service from an authentic Chinese restaurant is like expecting Donald Trump not to make a mockery of the election process.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 8, 5]}, "3": {"description": "I truly find this place delicious and I wouldn't mind to come here again.

PROS: \u00a0Relatively swanky, albeit a little tacky. But hey, this is Chinatown karaoke! \u00a0The prviate party room was unlike anything I've experienced before. \u00a0Fairly dark ambiance with sectional faux-leather couches, black lights among other pretty cool lighting fixtures along with glowing walls of random neon designs - very trippy, but that's all part of the fun. Other reviews have noted the private room areas are not large enough for (advertised) parties of 30, and I would agree. Our group size was closer to 15-20 and that was the optimal number. I wouldn't want anymore heads than that. \u00a0The private rooms truly make it private though...as in I gather just about anything goes. \u00a0Interpret that comment as you wish. CONS: The place was a little confusing to initially navigate, restrooms included. \u00a0And make sure to remember your private party room number before thowing back too many drinks. On that note, the watered down drinks from the bar disappointed me. Actually, not even sure there was any vodka whatsoever in my drink. Oh well, thankfully I had leftover booze from our prior BYOB dinner which def came in handly. \u00a0The sound/audio equipment was sufficient and the flat screen TV worked fine, but I did feel the music selection was a little lacking - they need some newer, more relevant tunes in my opinion - not just the same 'ol usual suspects. \u00a0And unfortunately, similar to many other places in Chinatown, the random stinch of sewage seems to come around every so often - namely in the common areas. \u00a0These places really need to consider scented candles or glad plug-ins. Or better yet, just fix these ongoing sewage smell issues altogether - new pipes and better ventilation would likely work wonders.

I don't know enough about curry to articulate the intricacies of, but I have eaten my fill of food to know good from great and the not so much. The curry is green sauce based and made with coriander so it's high on flavor, but low on spice; curry comes with pepper and asparagus that is well cooked so it's tender; bring it together with the chicken, sauce and rice and it all works well together.The Crumb Chicken is my other favorite dish here if I am in the mood for salad. Lightly breaded chicken that's tender accompanied by mango slices and warm, crisp potatos that brings a twist on something traditional and simple. The dressing is Zingy and works well with the other flavors; biting in to a particularly juicy tomato slice is refreshing with it all.Saint Alps is high on presentation and quality of food and the staff are friendly and caring for services rendered.

I'm a huge fan of asian food and being able to have the variety here and knowing that no matter what I choose it will still taste great. I've always been iffy about going to fusion places that serve more than 1 type of food since that usually means it's not great, but Joy Yee is really an exception! I love coming here every time I'm in Chicago. The only downside is that it can get really busy and the wait for your food sometimes can be long so when you're starving, you really have to fight it out.Can't wait for my next visit here!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 9, 28]}, "27": {"description": "Step on up and prepare to make some big decisions!

It always feels like we are on vacation. One of the problems we have is that we have found our favorite places in Chinatown, so we don't really venture out and try new places. We were looking for desert, after dinner. We tried a bakery a few doors down from here and the cake was not very good. So we decided we needed a fresh watermelon drink to wash it down. We walked up to check out the menu and a lady immediately opened a window and asked what we wanted. It was great and efficient. We did not even have to walk into the restaurant. We decided to grab a fresh watermelon smoothie. The lady went behind the bar and started making our drink. We waited outside and our smoothie arrived very quickly. There is even a nice little shelf installed on the outside edge of the window. The prices were also great too. It was only $3 plus tax per smoothie. A few doors down there was another location and they were charging $4.45 plus tax per smoothie. That location was crowded. I wonder if these people knew they could save money a few doors down at this place. The watermelon smoothie was really good. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a bad watermelon smoothie anywhere. It is always refreshing and delicious. So I am happy to say we have a new stop added on to our Chinatown visits. Plus you can't beat the price of the smoothies too. Now it looks like this restaurant has a full menu. I can not comment on the food or what the experience is inside the restaurant.

Since this was the only restaurant in Chinatown Square that wasn't completely deserted or full of non-asians, we decided to give it a try. Great first impression! The host, and probably owner, was so friendly and greeted us super nicely. We sat down and I think they served us water/tea pretty instantaneously. They gave us a few minutes to peruse the menu. We each ordered a fruit shake. My friend got a mango-watermelon with boba (it's pretty sweet that they let you mix two flavors). She seemed to really like it. I got the coconut red bean and it was the most disgusting thing ever. So artificial and the red beans were like a kidney bean-red bean hybrid instead of Azuki beans! Not to mention they were hard and not paste-y at all. Not worth the $3.50 + tax and tip at all.I almost ordered from their liquor menu but refrained. It was the same price, if not cheaper, than the regular drinks. Seriously, a cosmo for $3!?Then, the waitresses started getting impatient. First of all, they gave us less than five minutes. I don't think we were taking that long. Secondly, the restaurant was over half empty. It was 4 pm, don't know what the rush was. Thirdly, like many Chinese restaurants, their menu is an overwhelming mess of dishes. Not my fault they decided to throw every possible combination of meat and vegetables on there. Finally, no matter how long a customer is taking, it is just plain inhospitable for the server to just stand by the table and stare at us while we ordered, especially since we had already bought drinks.I got the beef with black bean sauce and my friend got the orange chicken. She seemed to like it. I'd say my dish was mediocre at best. It was really sweet and tasted like a crappy $5 dollar lunch special at your local take-out joint. Very non-authentic and greasy. Definitely not worth over $10.During the middle of our meal, half the restaurant got those special weather alerts on their phones and it started pouring. It was still pouring when we finished and they couldn't get rid of us quickly enough. Neither of us had umbrellas and half their tables were empty! So I don't see why they had to be so rude about making us leave. I paid $20 for a gross meal. They didn't even pack up our food completely so it spilled out all over our bags and we ended up just tossing everything when we got home.Don't come here, I know I won't ever again.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 6, 30]}, "32": {"description": "Like a previous Yelper mentioned, some dishes are okay and some are not.

The waitresses always seem to watch you like a hawk to make sure you pay and sign that check if you paid with a credit card. My dad once took his time to sign the check, and our waitress just stood right behind him and gave him the \"You better sign your damn name on that check\" look.There are so many restaurants in Chinatown.

The radish was soaked with all the juice and flavors. Wish there were more of them in a dish.- Tung Choy with preserved beancurd: tung choi is a relative of, you guessed it, bak choy and many choy - it's hollow so it's a great vegetable to stir fry and really get the flavor in. Preserved beancurd is an acquired taste. But if you go with others who like this flavor, I'd say give it a try! If you don't like it, you know someone will finish it instead of wasting food.I did notice quite a bit of items that are fried. We tried the fried pork chop and the batter was tasty coz it was made of eggs but it was also too thick for my preference.

Since this was the only restaurant in Chinatown Square that wasn't completely deserted or full of non-asians, we decided to give it a try. Great first impression! The host, and probably owner, was so friendly and greeted us super nicely. We sat down and I think they served us water/tea pretty instantaneously. They gave us a few minutes to peruse the menu. We each ordered a fruit shake. My friend got a mango-watermelon with boba (it's pretty sweet that they let you mix two flavors). She seemed to really like it. I got the coconut red bean and it was the most disgusting thing ever. So artificial and the red beans were like a kidney bean-red bean hybrid instead of Azuki beans! Not to mention they were hard and not paste-y at all. Not worth the $3.50 + tax and tip at all.I almost ordered from their liquor menu but refrained. It was the same price, if not cheaper, than the regular drinks. Seriously, a cosmo for $3!?Then, the waitresses started getting impatient. First of all, they gave us less than five minutes. I don't think we were taking that long. Secondly, the restaurant was over half empty. It was 4 pm, don't know what the rush was. Thirdly, like many Chinese restaurants, their menu is an overwhelming mess of dishes. Not my fault they decided to throw every possible combination of meat and vegetables on there. Finally, no matter how long a customer is taking, it is just plain inhospitable for the server to just stand by the table and stare at us while we ordered, especially since we had already bought drinks.I got the beef with black bean sauce and my friend got the orange chicken. She seemed to like it. I'd say my dish was mediocre at best. It was really sweet and tasted like a crappy $5 dollar lunch special at your local take-out joint. Very non-authentic and greasy. Definitely not worth over $10.During the middle of our meal, half the restaurant got those special weather alerts on their phones and it started pouring. It was still pouring when we finished and they couldn't get rid of us quickly enough. Neither of us had umbrellas and half their tables were empty! So I don't see why they had to be so rude about making us leave. I paid $20 for a gross meal.

Save the mapo tofu for Lao Sze Chaun down the road. This chicken dish (not sure what it was called, but it was literally just chicken. Plain. Nothing else, not even garnishes) was good, but in a very straight way, as if that's how chicken is supposed to taste. Flavorful, but ultimately uninteresting. It was really weird, and the dish remained largely untouched, so I'm planning on just using the leftovers for chicken fried rice or something.The standouts were the chow mein and fish fillets. The fish was delicious and melted in your mouth. I'd order it every time I came here. The mein was great, but not too different from similar dishes at other restaurants.

The third flavor was green tea and it tasted great, albeit a bit sugary and nothing really like green tea. The sesame balls had red bean paste, which was great! However, the exterior part was very thick. I had to take two big bites before I even reached the yummy red bean interior. We were especially grateful for the red bean interior because we had just eaten sesame balls for dim sum at Phoenix and the filling was lotus seed--not what we were expecting.

The fruit candy next to the display window caught my eye when I was walking around the Chinatown plaza, and I'm so happy I took a chance with this place. Even though Aji Ichiban is located in Chinatown, it definitely caters to a non-Asian population as well. Everything in the store is labeled with both Chinese and English names, making it super easy to decipher what you're dumping into your candy bag (which, by the way, goes for $11.50 per pound. A bit pricey, but I have yet to find an economy candy shop that sells candy at face value). Their store consists of Asian candy, a slight variety of old-school American candy, gummies, and a HUGE variety of dried fruit. Snacks that I have not munched on since middle school were sold here, and guess what, you get to sample before you buy! Even though I was never a big fan of the dried plums that Asians just seem to be extremely fond of, it was interesting getting to sample the 3+ varieties of dried plums they sold at Aji Ichiban. They also had dried strawberries, dried cherries, dried kiwi, you name it; most likely, if you're craving it, they have it. In addition to dried fruit, they also have dried anchovies, dried olives, and dried mushrooms (which I ended up purchasing). Since I wasn't from around there, I don't think I will be revisiting anytime soon, but if I find myself in Chi-town's Chi(na)town, I definitely would try to make a stop here! I am giving this place 4 stars because I'm impressed with their selection and sample offers. Honestly, you would not believe how many times I've bought a pound of food only to realize I did not like it because there was not an option to sample before purchasing.

Sometimes baiju and huangiu, the two most common of the Chinese liquors, are translated as \"rice wine,\" which I find misleading as they really don't taste like grape wine, they're stronger than most wines, though they are made from rice (usually). \u00a0I think there are regional differences in the grain, Southern Chinese baiju are made from rice, but Northern Chinese baiju may be made from sorghum, barley, or wheat. \u00a0The Chinese were the first civilization to develop modern agricultural techniques for all these grains. \u00a0I don't believe the grain makes the bigger difference in the taste variation for baiju, I think it's like vodka, the choice of water makes the difference, but I could be wrong on that, it may be caused by the different choices of yeast starters and I don't want to know about that. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I do know that baiju varies quite a bit in taste, and the fragrance patterns are:1) \u00a0Sauce bouquet (ji\u00e0ng xing) - Has a strong ammonia smell and is commonly served with appetizers and pickled food. \u00a0Maotai () is typical of this category.2) \u00a0Heavy bouquet (n\u00f3ng xing) - Sweet and mellow. \u00a0I think this is the kind that the chefs use, just a couple of drops, on fish or fish and vegetable dishes, just at the end of cooking, the improve the fishy smell. \u00a0Or, it could be that this is the choice of alcoholic cooks who cover up their drinking on the job, as a couple of Chinese cooks have told me that baiju is never used in cooking.3) \u00a0Light bouquet (qng xing) - A bit drier with less aroma.4) \u00a0Rice bouquet (m xing) - A subtle rice aroma.5) \u00a0Honey bouquet (fng xing) - Lightly sweet and aromatic. \u00a0I know this is the kind I don't like.6) \u00a0Layered fragrance - A combination of \"sauce,\" \"heavy,\" and \"light\" fragrances.The translation is crude, it's an example of the Sapir-Whorf thesis, some things just don't translate, but once you try the 6 different taste types, you'll know these differences and maybe you can correct or improve the English adjectives. \u00a0At any rate, this is the only liquor store in the metropolitan area that allows this wide a selection. \u00a0On the higher end are some absolutely beautiful bottles, so artistic and unusual, they would make memorable gifts, even if the recipients don't usually drink baiju, you can tell them it may be healthy for them (dubious Chinese medical research suggests that drinking yaojiu improved the blood circulation of elderly rats). \u00a0I find baiju to be very deceptive in terms of how quickly one can become impaired. Especially when you're eating dinner in Chinatown, I would recommend designating a driver who doesn't get any, or using public transportation.Gam Bei! \u00a0(I think that's Han for Kanpai)", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 10, 25]}, "9": {"description": "A friend and I were walking around Chinatown Square after dinner a few nights ago and came across this place.

Before walking into the shop, I hadn't planned on buying anything, but after he talked with us a bit we ended up buying a cheap bottle of sake.

I don't usually wander out of Chinatown Square unless I'm with my mom - which is probably the worst thing ever, but that's because I only go to places that are recommended to me - so I was hesitant to stop into Seven Treasures. My mother's friend, who was with us for the visit, talked up this place and shared so many great details about this place that when we walked into this dingy little hole in the wall, I didn't immediately turn back around and out the door.Seven Treasures has certainly seen better days; the moderately sized restaurant is composed of one large grey dining room and brought me back to my school cafeteria days. The table we were seated at was very wobbly, and even the gentle movement of an elbow could be felt from across the wide table. The rest of the furniture in the restaurant seemed equally outdated and worn. My mother's friend told us stories of the days Seven Treasures would keep tanks full of fish and lobsters for customers to pick. Those days sounded nice, and I wish I could have seen the restaurant in its hey-day. My mother's friend, clearly a veteran customer of 7T, ordered a large portion of the menu for our group, which definitely made this visit to Chinatown worth the travel through the snowy weather. The egg rolls were crunchy and fat, and just spilling with goodness. I don't think I've ever had egg drop soup that fulfilling (yes, it was fulfilling). It was warm and seasoned so well. Sometimes, egg drop soup lacks any memorable flavor, but this soup was everything you could ever want and more. Among other things, the beef and Chinese broccoli was phenomenal. The beef was tender and savory, and the broccoli retained it's crunch and signature flavor unique to this variation of the vegetable. \u00a0The shrimp in the shrimp chow mein were so plump and juicy. Tip: The Cantonese fried shrimp are cooked in such a way that you can eat the whole thing, shell and all. The fried outer shell of the crab creates a crunch to the already almost soft shell crab-like texture of the shrimp meat. Tip: the food, as expected from a little hole in the wall, was fairly greasy. If you're feeling like you've hit your fat wall, but just can't stop, get a Coke. That carbonation will help move the grease trapped inside you and gear you up for the rest of your meal.

Am I not speaking Chinese well enough for you to converse with me in it? Do I look funny? Anyway, the food itself was pretty good. The dumplings I have to say were probably the best part of the meal. We got potstickers and the steamed variety and the filling inside was just plain tasty. The skin was thick, which I usually do not like, but this time it gave it a good texture and chew. The potstickers were better than the steamed, but then of course they're fried, oil makes everything better.And they followed that line of reasoning to the end. We also ordered the sauteed peasprouts, the chicken nest, and the shredded pork with onion. Everything was greasy to the nines - way greasier than I'm used to. Thankfully we had some tea to cut through the fat, but it was pretty greasy overall. The pea sprouts were \"old\" and was not the tender variety, which just means that it requires more chewing and is kind of more like chewing on grass. But the flavor was good. The pork with onion was very tasty, authentic, but it was SUPER oily. And the chicken nest had some great flavor; although it was greasy it tasted slightly healthier than the pork since it was just a leaner type of meat.They finish the meal by giving you fortune cookies and almond cookies.

They should really call it Go 4 (insert lame-before-it's-even-said 'joke' word here).\"The waiter suggested their Ban Mi Tacos with Korean-style BBQ pork.

That was a winner; so we took his suggestions for our entrees as well: the French Style Beef Tenderloin, and the Razor Clams. The tenderloin had a melt-in-my-mouth texture, once I bit through the crusty outside--the perfect combination, with a sauce that might have made Pavlov himself, and not just his dog, drool. I'd never had a razor clam, and most clams I'd had in the past were a bit rubbery. G4F must have read my mind to \"hold the rubber,\" the critters were quite enjoyable.

Over the years, different disgruntled hairstylists have broken off from Urban Roots to start their own salons right down the street; what's somewhat amusing is the sense of tension you get from all this \"hair salon\" drama. Granted, it really isn't thaaat deep but Urban Roots Salon used to be the top dog, the Queen Bee if you will and now, from her own hive, ambitious worker drones have colonized new hives to challenge her throne (i guess drones wouldn't be able to but for the sake of the metaphor, whaatever). Even my extended family has been torn apart (at least in the hair arena); some of my family has switched to other salons while others have remained loyal to Urban Roots. As for myself, I've been getting my hair cut here for about 6-7 years and I can honestly say that I've never come away disappointed. My wallet maybe. But me, never.I've always had my hair cut by Ray so I can't comment on the skills of other stylists but I highly recommend asking for Ray if you make an appointment. He's very nice and is very good at remembering how you got your hair cut during your last appointment; definitely saves on the trouble of bringing in a picture or something. What makes this place great is how easy everything seems to flow. You walk in and within 5 minutes, they'll take you back and wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. After a quick towel dry, you'll have your hair cut and once your finished, they'll wash your hair again with shampoo and dry/style it for you, if you wish. And what's more important is that they are very good about being on time. Rarely will they be behind schedule and make you wait and what's more is if you know you will be late or might be in Chinatown a bit early, they will gladly switch up your appointment time if they have the room. One thing you can try to do is schedule during the weekdays or earlier on the weekends. This isn't as much of a problem now since many other salons have slowly sapped away customers but when the schedule gets packed, most of the hair stylists will start to rush on your haircut just so they don't fall behind. While that's obviously annoying, you can save yourself the irritation and at the same time, you'll get more well paced service.The only point of contention I can think of is the price. While the haircuts are good, the cost is definitely on the high end and adding a tip for your stylist will raise the total quite steeply. However, if you're not too worried about the pricing, I would definitely recommend this place.

They're a bit pricier than what I was used to in San Francisco ($15-$20 in most salons) at around $30 for a wash and cut.

I've never had a disappointing meal here. Most recently, my friends and I came here for our pre-Chinese New Year's dinner, and it was delicious. We ordered a lot of food, where do I even start?One of my favorite things to order here, though, is the saliva (kou shui) chicken (ji). That sounds gross, doesn't it? That's the literal translation; a better translation is probably mouth-watering chicken. It's a cold appetizer with chicken chunks drowning in peanuts and chili oil. The fish hot pot is also a must-order here, as other Yelpers have mentioned. Unfortunately, I do think it's a bit pricey here. Cheng-du Impression in Lincoln Park (of all places, I know!) offers the same dish at a much more affordable price; I just wish they would finish with their renovations and re-open soon.I also really loved pickled mustard green and fish soup (suan cai yu). My mom made this when I was a kid, and the flavors really brought me back. I loved the sourness of the pickled mustard, coupled with slices of white fish and garnished with red peppers, green onions, and topped with some oil. I'm going to have to try to replicate this recipe at home now.The married couple's lung slices (fu qi fei pian) is delicious here as well. I know the names are strange, but trust me on this one. There's probably no lungs in this dish. It's thinly sliced beef tongue and tripe (as far as I can tell) marinated with chili oil. I mentioned a lot of chili oil in this review. There's lots of chili oil in Sichuan cuisine, so it's not for those who cannot handle spices.Can't stand spices? You can always order the Sichuan green beans or pea tip sprouts. The latter is a good dish to order for vegetarians, as there's no meat in it. But you can find these two dishes almost anywhere else in Chinatown.It's hard for me to name off all the dishes I enjoyed here because there's a lot.

Ma Gong La Po provides an authentic northern style Chinese meal that is outside of the standard Canto fare found all over the rest of Chinatown. Most of the restaurants in Chinatown I feel are \"sold-out\", appealing to the tourist masses *ahem Lao Bejing/Szechuan/Shanghai/YouJu* (Gross). They over-emphasize on quantity over quality. Which is why I really enjoyed both my visits to this new establishment. This place opened not that long ago. I've been here twice within a month, and the food has been excellent both times. I came here with a few friends each time and we ordered more than we can handle. Item's I have tried1. Lamb and vegetables cooked in hot oil - This in my opinion is hands-down the best thing. Silky smooth lamb cooked in their home made hot spices. The kicker are the vegetables found underneathe which has absorbed all the flavor of the spices. There is lettuce, bean sprouts, onions, celery - the combination is perfect and flawlessly tasty!2. Fu-qi-fei-pian - Beef and beef parts marinated in hot spices topped with cilantro. How can you complain? Its delicious and tastes better than Ed's and Spring World. 3. Vegetable/Melon cooked in garlic sauce - It is cooked very lightly and sauteed with garlic. Not overwhelmingly salty and goes perfectly with the lamb and fish. Just as a vegetable dish should be, it doesn't over power from the meats. Just healthily cooked veggies. 4. xiao long bao - Average5. Whole fish cooked in hot oil - This is the restaurants trademark. If you come on a busy night, 9/10 tables will have ordered this. The fish is cooked in their home made spices and you can throw in veggies, noodles, etc. The whole time you are eating the fish is sitting on top of a portable stove so it is steaming the whole time. Fish doesn't taste fishy at all as well. The last time I went it was quite cool outside, but it was pretty warm inside. Add that to eating some scolding spicy food and I was drenched in sweat while eating since they did not have the AC on. However, no complaints because I feel like it really adds to the experience. If I was dining at a authentic restaurant in China, it would be the same.

They describe it as a cheaper, more authentic Joy Yee with a bit more emphasis on Chinese cuisine and not the whole array of Asia.I haven't dined in yet, but I've ordered from them twice. Both times, it was super hard to get them on the landline since I am sure they are constantly busy. Each time, I ordered two of my favorite Cantonese style dishes, and so far, it's been above average, but still misses the mark on some parts. Allow me to explain:* Salt & Pepper Squid - I love me some calamari, and Chi Cafe does it well. For $9, you get a generous amount that resembles what I expect to get from a Chinese restaurant, Well done, and definitely ask for more pepper because it's not enough!* Beef Brisket w/ Egg Noodle Soup - The soup was bland as hell surprisingly, but the egg noodles and beef brisket itself was great! This one barely made it pass average, but with the low price tag, I could hardly complain.* Squid In Thousand Island Sauce - Looks like tteok bukki if anything, but was surprisingly delicious! They prepared this well with the sauce not completely overpowering the dish, and you still had good amounts of squid to eat. Garnished with two pieces of bok choy* Salt & Pepper Pork Chops - Okay... this is one of my favorite Cantonese dishes that is not hard to execute. Chi Cafe unfortunately disappointed me with these. Flavors were not there, pork chops were chewy as hell. I was upset by these! Definitely pass.So overall, better than average, but still really depends on the actual dish.

When Jess visits, we plan to go again, and this time I'll try to remember or note what we ordered.

The rice box prices range from $3.75 to $4.50 and are huge portions for the price. Also the orders are placed and cooked very quickly even though the place may be crowded with customers. This restaurant deserves 5 stars for the food (taste, quality, price), but much lower for the environment.

Funn Roll is basically like a rice noodle crepe with various ingredients inside like beef and shrimp served with soy sauce.

Gourmet Food makes sticky rice year round, but on days when the weather is extremely hot they do not make this oh so yummy treat. When the weather gets warmer nothing is better than soy bean pudding.

Not at all very tasty or well executed. Our simplest dish was Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce. It was cooked just right, but preparation of the stalks of the gai lonn did not aid in eating them. Each stalk was sliced in such a way that thwarted picking it up with fork or chopsticks! Quite an accomplishment. The meat-filled fish balls (3 per bowl) were about the size of a large matzoh ball, but a lot denser, which made them difficult to eat or divide (especially in the soup bowl). Our stir-fried green beans could have been very good, with slivers of garlic, ginger, and fried bacon in the mix. But for some reason, it was all overcooked. Some of the beans had become almost paper-like.

We walked in at about 9:30 on a Sat. night, and easily had our choice of any seat in the place. That quickly changed, as Kam Fung serves a late night menu (until 2am) where everything is $3.99. By the time we left we were the only non-Chinese people in the place and there were people waiting for our table.We started with soups - wonton, which had a flavorful, fragrant broth and multiple (!) wontons; and a hot & sour, which was loaded with pork, chicken, mushrooms, and tons of other things in a thick, brown soup. I'll be getting the wonton again next time I go back, which will be soon. On to the egg rolls - served hot & crispy without any stray oil & grease. By this time I'm bouncing around with anticipation like a little school girl waiting for the main dishes. I mean like silly giddy. \u00a0We ordered 4 dishes, which was WAY too much food. But that's ok, because it was soooo good that all the leftovers (2 more meals worth!) got devoured.We had the: Shrimp & vegetable chow fun - served in a casserole dish, the noodles were delightfully slightly crunchy while being the perfect noodle consistency at the same time. The sauce was light, the vegetables plentiful & crunchy, and the shrimp was wonderful.Seafood w/XO sauce - For those of you who don't know what XO sauce is (that was me until I tried this dish), here's wiki's answer: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XO\u2026. Kam Fung doesn't joke around when it comes to seafood. This dish was piled high with shrimp, scallops, octopus, and other fish that escapes me right now. Yum. I'm now a huge fan of XO sauce.Shredded Pork in Ya Shung sauce - I'm not a big pork eater so I only had a bite to taste this, but it tasted remotely like barbeque. It was as good as something you don't really like can be. :) \u00a0The 2 guys at the table who love pork raved about the dish; flavor, texture, and anything else they can think of. It was an overflowing plate of food and they put a nice dent in it.Shrimp in lobster sauce - You all know this dish. An old standard that Kam Fung does well. They do theirs with a yummy thick brown sauce with tons of giant shrimp. Certainly not disappointing.I haven't had good, real, Chinese food since moving here from NY, and my BF, who is from Alabama, has had great NY Chinese, but nothing as authentic as this. Kam Fung is the real deal, and restored my faith in Chinese food and opened his eyes to an entirely new world. I can't wait to go back, and I'm sure it'll be soon.Everyone left stuffed and elated, and brought home over half their dish.

Although we did not encounter the same problems as in that review, all was not rosy at our group's meal either. Kam Fung was a last minute choice switch in our group's quest for Cantonese fare. Their menu met that criteria and the ingredients used would please the many who savor the cuisine of south China. We were seated at a round table with a round glass \"lazy susan\" in the center of the white vinyl \"table cloth.\" Although the rotating glass disc was large, the number and size of all our dishes eventually overwhelmed it.We chose one of the pre-selected \"family\" package meals that was intended for a group of 8. This would give us an excellent introduction to the cooking at Kam Fung while also providing a variety of meat, fowl, seafood, and vegetables. As with many such Cantonese meals, our table began it by sharing a tureen of flavorful soup, based on a pork broth, containing pieces of Chinese broccoli. It was a good beginning. A helpful touch at Kam Fung for large groups are the electric rice steamers that they station next to your table, so you can refill your own bowls of white rice as you feel the need to.Our main dishes were a mixed bag. The whole lobster was one any kitchen couldn't mess up, presented in cut pieces with the shell still attached. The vegetable stir fry featured slices of lotus root, wood ear, and black mushrooms, but nothing much memorable about that. There was the two-bite filets of white fish gently deep-fried in a whisper-light golden coating of flour (?), presented on a plate of complimentary vegetables. Cantonese cuisine doesn't use the spicy, hot flavors of the northern cuisines. But sweet and sour is something that highlights its dishes. Ours was a rather odd one; pieces of cut-up pork chops (instead of ribs) battered and coated in a gloppy red sweet/sour BBQ sauce. One ate it for the well-cooked meat, but the sauce was a disaster! We also enjoyed the large shrimps (oxymoron) in a stir fry with unmemorable vegetables and a too-thick sauce.Being that we were dining just ahead of the lunar new year, the prospect of sharing a whole roasted chicken was a traditional touch of good luck. Unfortunately, the platter of sliced pieces (including the head, of course) must have just come out of the refrigerator - cooked, but cold! I can't recall ever getting chicken served this cold in a Chinese restaurant or even direct from the Chinese BBQ shop. The standard dipping sauce for chicken of salt and oil with chopped chives was a hit though.Everyone thinks that fortune cookies are the Chinese \"dessert.\" It's not! Maybe that's because the sweet treats that end a Cantonese meal aren't all that spectacular. Our meal ended with each getting a small bowl of traditional, cold, sweet, red bean soup. THEN, the fortune cookies. All in all, not a terrible meal. And the service was good and attentive. But with so many choices in Chinatown and around the city, it's unlikely our group will return here.", "rating": "3", "date": [2012, 2, 9]}, "5": {"description": "The \u7172\u4ed4\u996d is the one must order items here, small place but sometime they keep it as very taishangese local style.

The eel with ginger and green onions, for example, which is a bit pricey but amazingly flavorful if you like eel.And, as for the English menu, I have not had better clams in black bean sauce in any restaurant around here. The sauce is light but intense, with enough fermented black beans to complement the clams but not overwhelm their natural sweetness. This is a must-try dish here, in my opinion.

We ordered the taro dish again asking them to add less salt. Another dish was a Chinese sausage clay pot dish. They steam the rice and the Chinese sausage in a clay pot. All the flavors and aroma of the Chinese sausage gets soaked up by the rice so the rice is just as flavorful as the Chinese sausage. Once you open the cover of the clay pot the smell of the dish is irresistible. You just gotta dig in! This place is the place for authentic flavorful Chinese food. Just make sure you drink a lot of water while eating and afterward. You are surely gonna need it after eating all the tasty salty Chinese food.

Well you can still say happy new year cuz it's a week long celebration for Vietnamese and Chinese people.

Here's what I ordered: large rice, half of a roasted duck, 2 lbs of roasted pork, beef and veggie chow fun and roasted duck with wonton noodle soup. \u00a0Hell to the yeah! All that was around 33 dollars. First off the duck and pork were good. I was given mostly lean pork meat but it was still very moist and it had a good flavor to them so no need for a dipping sauce. The skin was disappointing because it wasn't very crisp. The noodle soup was excellent! The broth was perfect. I didn't have to add anything but jalape\u00f1os and some chili sauce cuz I like my broth spicy! I really enjoyed the noodles, wontons and roasted duck in it- those are the real stars of the show. The noodles were perfect, not mushy but had a nice slight chew to them like it should. The wontons were nice and plump, very good. This was great after a frigid morning out and after finishing this big bowl of noodle soup, it made me not miss home as much. But let me tell you what really won me over: the chow fun.Praise the good Lord- a chinese restaurant that didn't douse their noodle sauce with corn starch! *round of applause* Finally I found decent chow fun that's not bland, has decent gravy to it without too much thickener and the noodles had awesome wok marks on them. The beef is really tender and there was lots of it along with lots of chinese brocolli. I'll take it now that VEGETABLES on the menu means just chinese brocolli at chinese restaurants around this city. My only complaint is that there's lots of noodles still clumped together but it could be worse since these noodles are delicate and hard to cook for they get ruined if you stir it around too much. Also no the noodles are not clumpy because of being put in a takeout box. I've handled these noodles since childhood- helping my father make chow fun and if you don't spread apart the layers- this is what happens. The noodles are made and come in layers and as a cook, you have to spread apart the layers to stir fry them.. Duuuuuuh. For Chicago and the Midwest- this place is great and I would absolutely come again. They serve a lot of rice plates (BBQ duck on rice, etc..) for a bargain at 5.75. I'll have to come back and try their other fried noodles. The people here are great- they are so nice. The place is rough around the edges but cozy.

After all, with Pilsen not too far away now becoming gentrified because of how welcoming businesses were, now the rent is sky high and pushing out long time residents.But i digress, I am used to most businesses in Chinatown being not so welcoming, but this restaurant was a pleasant change! When we entered, we originally just wanted to buy something quick and get parking validation. It is a small restaurant very hole-in-the-wall place. We were greeted at the door by a very nice waitress who sat us down immediately. She didn't really know English too well, but that's fine because there were menus on the table. My room mate and I got Family Dinner for 2 for 19.95 - it was simple and it made ordering even more simple. (We didn't even really look to see what it included, we just wanted food fast since we were hungry.)We were served this odd looking bean soup that wasn't too appetizing to look at - but we were blown away by how good it was! It was simple, nothing fancy but delicious. Then she brings out this huge plate full of combination fried rice and me and my roomie are thinking, \"That's a lot! How are we going to finish it?\" But we dug right in. The pork and shrimp were cooked nicely and the fried rice didn't have that odd dark brown color to it like most places do.We're thinking, this is it and it's still worth it - but then she comes out with another plate full of chicken and peapods. \u00a0The chicken was cooked well and the peapods were nice and juicy with a little crisp in them. Then she brought out two BIG eggrolls! I'm feeling like royalty here. And for a second, I hoped she might not have given us a bigger menu option. I asked her, and she giggled and just said \"No it's just a lot of food!\" At this point we are so stuffed, but out comes ANOTHER plate of teriyaki beef and broccoli. Needless to say, we have leftovers for a few days. You get a lot of bang for your buck here and it is all delicious AND they are actually really really nice here too!

Most Chinese locals seem to go there for the meat take-outs, though it's also a nice place to sit and enjoy a good bowl of wonton and noodles if you want to get a more authentic Chinatown or Chinese street food experience.Very highly recommended, however, I'm saddened they don't serve congee any more.To non-Chinese yelpers: You are missing out the best of this place if you're eating your orange chicken and crab rangoons!

The bride couldn't quite adjust to the first pair of eye-lashes applied but Wendy was very patient about it and immediately helped her put on a more subtle pair. The whole-do took a little longer than anticipated and added a slight delay to our schedule. So while I waited, Wendy had her assistant curl my hair. By the time, the bride was done, Wendy then clipped and hair-sprayed my curls into a bun with a twirled tail lopped to one side. It doesn't sound right but it came out looking right! (I will post a picture once the photographer finishes the edits.) I have to point out how Wendy did a great job with my bangs. I liked how she used bobby pins to secure the bangs before applying a mass load of hairspray. It prevented my bangs from splitting and dividing into three sets of bangs. As for make-up, I had the full course from foundation to plucking my eyebrows to fake eye-lashes. The eye-lashes stayed in place even though we were out in the heat for some four hours. That day was approximately 85 degrees but we were also by the beach and baking in the sun for a good while. I liked the purple eye-shadow that Wendy used as well as the lip gloss, but what I liked most was the slight highlight along the nose to make the bridge appear taller.

We all arrived within seconds of each other and were seated right away! If you're all about that 'instant' lifestyle, you'll enjoy this place. I've averaged about 30mins wait times at most other Dim Sum places (mostly at Cai), but not here. This is not to say that Phoenix is unpopular, it's one of the most talked about Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown, the food and service speak for themselves. Very authentic a la carte experience where the servers circulated the tables with small trolleys and make stops announcing what it is that is on the cart. Menus are also available if you don't see your favorites around. The cart wielders are friendly and take requests to cut items down to smaller sizes. Our table aimed to eat as much as possible. We demolished all the traditional items such as seared dumplings, shrimp egg rolls, sticky rice with chicken, egg tarts, mango jello, shu mai, soft tofu, chicken feet, taro cakes, shrimp ho fun, crispy sesame balls, bbq pork buns, beef tendons, and this only covered less than 1/4 of the items available.In terms of food quality, I'd say it's excellent. The food all came out piping hot, resembling freshness and promptness. I didn't feel the typical after effects of MSG as I normally would at other restaurants, but since we all overate, we had a slight food-coma, but that's expected.

Phoenix used to be the best Chinese food IN TOWN. Not just Chinatown but all of the Chicagoland Area. They had a wonderful staff to match their exquisite food. They were packed ALL the time. But I guess all good things have to come to an end.. The Remodel was the beginning of that end. It went from an out-of-date, large but slightly clich\u00e9, 90s Chinese restaurant (just from appearance) to a lush, modern and shiny new establishment. Unfortunately, that's not where the change stopped... At the beginning of the sumer, ownership switched hands and let me say it was NOT for the better. My family has been coming here regularly for two decades and I think today may have been our last. First, the entire staff that had been working there for the whole time we had been coming was replaced with a younger staff. Sure their English is better but they also stopped trying. Little things like walking around your table as they refill your water, not a huge deal, but when my 81 year old grandma is reaching a glass across a table to a 20 year old guy it starts to look ridiculous. The lack of liquor license is certainly not helping either...I don't know how to put this best but the most heartbreaking part is the degradation of the food.

We knew this place was popular and were totally expecting a wait (it ended up being closer to 40 minutes, but I'm not complaining). Phoenix Restaurant apparently no longer does the traditional Dim Sum experience of bringing carts around to the tables and allowing diners to select items; rather, the diner selects items on a menu and then the food is brought out, making it far more similar to a typical tapas restaurant than anything else. Not totally what I was expecting, but not a deal-breaker.After we were seated, it became clear that the restaurant operates under some degree of chaos. We were never sure who we were supposed to provide our order to and ended up with a few flummoxed servers (I think?) who took our order. Then another (that we had to flag down) for water and soy sauce. A few of our items came out. The spring rolls were good, if a bit greasy. The steamed pork buns were nice. The pan-fried chive patties were delicious. I would like to comment on the other things we ordered, but they never showed up. Except for some gelatinous-looking (and feeling, and tasting) shrimp and cilantro dumplings a full FIFTY minutes after ordering.Frustrated, we left, taking our order sheet to the cashier and paying for the items we actually received. They didn't charge us for the items we ordered and didn't receive, which was nice, but there was nothing in the form of an apology. At least comp us our tea (your cost on a pot of tea is what...four cents?). Then, the cashier told us we could leave a tip at our table. A TIP?

Lots of people were huddled outside the front door and I was afraid we would be in for a long wait. However we walked up the stairs and were seated IMMEDIATELY. Next thing we knew we had tea (which to my unrefined tastebuds just tastes like warm water..but still!) on our table and the dim sum menu. Oh, sweet heavens. Ordered: pan fried dumplings. taro cake. bbq pork buns. custard roll. custard buns. lotus buns. rice in lotus leaf. The BEST: Pan fried pork dumplings. OH. MY. GOSH. is all I can say. we ordered an extra order and stuffed ourselves and then saved the remaining for breakfast. bbq pork buns. What is IN this deliciousness?? Sticky rice: good portion and yummy. The least: Custard roll. Simple and sweet but tastes like a fancy twinky. Of course, it wasn't bad. just takes up room in your tummy that should be saved for the stuff listed above. They did forget a couple things we ordered (which was fine...there was no room left in our bellies) but did not charge it.

My roommate disliked it so much, she decided to write/joke about \"nasty chinese food\" on social media.The meat had way too much breading and not enough actual meat, both of us noted that in both orders and my roommate said she noticed a slight burned taste. Yikes.Each order was ordered with rice and yet our bag only came with one box of rice, so we ended up splitting the rice and I didn't call the driver back because I decided to just cook white rice if needed. The sauce was like goop, thickened. The flavor wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as well made sauce.I've had way better Chinese food for less or the same price, so I was not impressed and would be unlikely to order again without a recommendation for a specific food item from someone I trust.Positive points- The broccoli in my sesame chicken was well cooked, not too soft or hard. The portion sizes are huge, so if the food was tasting really good, it would have been awesome. The driver was nice and came within the estimated time. For delivery, the prices are reasonable though the quality doesn't quite match.All in all, we were pretty disappointed and after some bites, I started feeling a bit nauseated.

The noodles were maybe okay but the tiniest drop of the broth was death. I tried to cool the spice with the milk tea they have but it did not work at all. I ended up getting through the bowl but I think I would've enjoyed just getting a classic bowl of ramen a lot more. Moral of the story, definitely do know your own spice tolerance and take their warnings. Overall I still think it's a good ramen place though, usually pretty popular but they call you when it's your turn so it's not too bad.

About the same length but frizzier and limper. Felt like I paid $32+tip for something that Great Clips could have done for $10.

He wanted to get his hair cut short, but leaving at least 2 inches (and this was communicated to his hairstylist).

Someone else had to ask for a clean cup for me; later she brought two: one clean and one with stuck on dough (why didn't she check?)Because of her attitude; I asked the hostess at the front if they do mandatory tip on larger parties; her response was: \"State of IL law does not require mandatory gratuity\". I thought good: I personally didn't want to give her one for myself only. Just after that, the manager came by and asked if everything was ok, chatted with us and was very pleasant. The food was good; but again; the server was slow to serve; check on us, follow up and present our bill. Here's the kicker; she put mandatory gratuity on there. That honestly upset me. If everyone in my party wanted to put in for that; that's fine; but I personally don't think she deserved it just because there were so many of us there.

Not a bad place to stop by if other restaurants in Chinatown Square get too full but if you go through the trouble of trying to find parking in this area, there are better choices available. If this wasn't located in Chinatown Square, I might bump it up .5 or maybe even 1-star but the quality of food in this area has gotten better and to remain competitive it's necessary to offer both delicious and wonderfully presented food.Drinks (teas, smoothies, etc.) - Similar to non-specialty places (like Joy Yee's) in Chinatown.Ong choy - Vegetables are fresh but the dish could have been more flavorfulChef special combination ramen - Pretty good ramen with nice noodles.Lemongrass chicken wings - nice large wings and crispy but the flavor didn't stand outBaked pork chop over Portuguese sauce - I wasn't a fan of the flavor but it wasn't done poorly either. I prefer the Chi Cafe version more.Fish fillet with chinese vegetables - Didn't like this dish -- wasn't a fan of the flavor choices.Walnut shrimp - Good size shrimp with a nice texture.Chef Special Pork Neck Meat - One of the better pork neck dishes I've had in the midwest. Good texture and flavor with a good amount of meat. This is the only dish that stood out in my mind.This restaurant has a very good location since it sits in one of the entrance/exit spots in the square but the lack of consistency in quality among dishes prevents it from being rated any higher.

So I asked hubby to go out and eat hot pot. The regular place (where we always go) was 40 minutes wait, so hubby decided to try my place instead. The sign was promising, $16 something for all you can eat hotpot, and I was okay, bring it on!! (Being pregnant makes you eat like a pig)BUT!!!!!!!! This place is certainly not a good place to get hotpot. The broth tasted blah. We got half spicy and half not spicy. The spicy broth looked promising, \u00a0I meant it looked spicy because it has chili and all that spicy thing, but it didnt taste spicy at all. The not spicy broth tasted like water, literally taste bland. Yes they did give us some condiments sauce, but it didn't help at all. As most chef say, a little salt and pepper makes food taste much better.Then come to the ordering the hotpot stuff. They gave you paper and you check which food you want to have (tofu, beef, lettuce, pork blood, etc). We ordered shrimp, fatty beef, tofu, \u00a0fish tofu, lettuce, mushroom, clam and scallop (extra $3 for clam and scallop).When the stuff came, my husband definitely knew that it wasn't what we ordered. So we asked the waitress. She explained it in mandarin (I think), luckily we went out with a friend who speaks mandarin. Blah blah blah, basically we got the wrong order, but since its all you can eat, she said we can have it. But we decided not to, because there's pork blood and we don't eat that kinda stuff. We filed out the paper again and waited for like 15 minutes for the food to come. And I was so disappointed, \u00a0because it was missing a couple stuff, like mushroom, fish tofu and I forgot what.But with us being hungry, we decided to eat and order again. And it took another 15 minutes for the other order to come. All in all, its supposed to be all you can eat, but after waiting for sometime, we got tired and just basically give up. We paid around $97 for 4 people, \u00a0but seriously, \u00a0we didn't eat a lot. And yes, we're still hungry so for that amount of money we paid, it wasn't worth it. If I go to the other place, I would probably be full. Plus, the service was not good. We often heard the servers talked sooo loud and sometimes screaming among themselves. Its just not professional.

There is something both magical and sad about late night cravings, especially if it accompanied by a long wait at a time all you want to do is get your guilty gluttonous eating in prior to crawling into your bed after a long night out. MyPlace (outside from it's confusing name, which is the butt of many of jokes between me and MyFriends) is always a welcoming place to eat past 12am. There usually isn't too bad of a wait during late night, and it provides relatively good service for Chinatown along with standard to above average food (in reality all the restaurants tastes the same in Chinatown after awhile). I haven't really sampled all the drinks at MyPlace, but the friends I typically bring here for smoothies all give them a strong endorsement. I typically stick to the traditional HK milk tea and half and half (half milk tea and half milk coffee) and they are relatively good. The food is pretty standard for a HK style cafe. Everything is relatively good, but I typically get either the Portuguese baked rice with chicken or salt and pepper pork chops. I also frequently get the congee because it's the lightest thing on the menu for late night eating. MyPlace also offers some fantastic value eats for breakfast, lunch, and snack time. These deals typically run from $3.50-$5.00 and come with a hot drink. Really hard to beat a full meal and drink for under $5 (even in Chinatown). Overall, is the food amazing? No. Is it above average? Sure. But the main appeal for me is the fact that I never feel rushed at MyPlace. They serve decent tea, decent drinks, and have pretty good service for Chinatown.

The English name sounds too general for it to stand out but I am absolutely addicted! It's a simple stir-fried dish with wild mushrooms or tea-leaf mushrooms for the direct translation and it does wonders. In addition, I've also tried eggplant and salty fish, clams in black bean sauce, peapod tips with mushroom, sweet and sour pork, sizzling beef tenderloin, etc. 3) For late night, I've always succumbed to the fattest and unhealthiest dish: fried pork cutlet with egg noodles in broth and milk tea. There are carbs, grease, caffeine, and sugar in the mix. Sounds like the perfect combination for a hungry belly...even at a late hour.

Once we got there we stopped in a gift shop and asked a sales clerk, who suggested House of Fortune. The local recommendation served us well -- were in for one of the best Chinese restaurant meals we've ever had.Resisting our efforts to nudge him off the beaten path, our 8-year-old insisted on orange chicken. As it turns out, House of Fortune's orange chicken actually is off the beaten path. The chicken was fresh and the breading light and crispy. Now about the sauce, this dish is typically spicy (it's one of those with a little pepper next to it in the margin of the menu) but they offered to make it non-spicy for our son. I thought that would amount to dumbing-down the orange sauce and making it bland. The sauce they served, though not spicy, was complex and flavorful. It was definitely orange chicken, but unlike any other - and better than any other - we've had. My wife and I split a seafood sampler served in a Phoenix nest. The Phoenix nest consists of taro root shredded into long pieces, then deep fried into the shape of a nest, surrounded by crunchy, lightly-cooked broccoli. The seafood included large, juicy shrimp, squid, and scallops with a light sauce accented with slivers of fresh ginger root. Absolutely delicious.The service was excellent. Without ever hovering over use, the wait staff was always sort of in orbit and responded at a glance. They were polite and casual, and took the time to dote on our son.We also sampled the crab rangoon, which was outstanding, and the hot-and-sour soup. Only two things could make the soup better: a dash of soy sauce (it needed to be just a bit saltier than as-served) and a head cold. There is nothing better than hot-and-sour soup when you're under the weather. None of us were sick, but the soup hit the spot nonetheless.Before you go, be aware that the stretch of Wentworth where you'll find House of Fortune is a bit the worse for wear. The avenue is lined with gift shops a mixture of very nice gifts and kitchy trinkets -- some of the shops err more on the kitchy trinket side. The buildings are not in great shape. Some of the other restaurants we passed were loud and dingy. Don't let that throw you. When we reached House of Fortune we were greeted like family and ushered to table.

The menu is large, so finding the style of dishes that suits your palette might take a few trips. It's so worth it. Many of the dishes don't translate well to take out. They're best eaten fresh from the kitchen. I think the fried foods are the best here like shrimp with spicy salt no shell (ask for red vinegar to sprinkle them with), 5 spice chicken, and general tso's chicken. Peking duck and the noodle dishes are pretty great, too. Also try #111 pan fried won ton with meat. They are the best dumpling appetizer. Oh, the drinks are strong. Charlie, who runs the place, is very a friendly and laid back guy. The waitstaff are very nice and fast. We often have special requests (like easy ginger or american broccoli not chinese) or make up our own dishes which they don't mind to accommodate at all. My mom likes beef with bitter melon. It's on the menu, but they don't always keep bitter melon in the kitchen because of lack of popularity. When she orders it, someone runs next door to the grocery to get it for the dish. How's that for service? We also go for more casual family parties. There's a nice sized party room and a couple large tables in the main dining room. We often celebrate birthdays there, and bring cake which they don't mind cutting and serving. They do not mind kids at all. In fact, the staff kind of gravitates around the tables where kids are to help out. On a side note, House of Fortune is popular with travelling dignitaries and other hot shots. It is closed for private parties every once in a while for symphonies and even the Premier of China when he was in town a few years ago.

We started out with \"quo tip\", or fried wontons, which were very meaty, but the skins was a bit too thick and it was a little greasy. Next, we got the \"siu long bao\". The skin, was once again thick.. and there was no juice- the main staple of siu long bao! We also got:- Crispy chicken- good, not too much fat, and the skin was the right amount of crispy-ness- Sweet and sour porkchops?- I'm not sure what exactly it translates to english, but the sauce was a tad too red.. but the meat itself was tender.- A hot pot of fish, cha siu, and tofu- that was good. It even had abalone in it.- Fish mixed with pea pods dish- that was alright. This restaurant cooked with more oil than I would have liked.. but it still tasted good.Overall, the food was slightly above average. However, I liked the cleanliness of the restaurant- the dishes and tea cups didn't have the normal grime that most Canto restaurants have. Additionally, the wait staff was FAST, and the food all came out fast as well- on a busy Sunday afternoon.Would I go back here again? Eh. If I craved Canto dinner food, then yes.. however, nothing was super unique about the resturant- no unique dishes, just the same traditional foods. However.. I was happy when I left the restaurant.

(Requires finger use, difficult otherwise. No tools avail?)Beef tenderloin chow funLamb chops x2 in different marinades (The meat was easy to cut through for sharing.)Appetizers:Something with Woodear mushrooms (I love mushrooms and Woodear is great for you, but most of the table was not impressed with it.)Fried Shrimp dumplings.Beyond this a couple more plates were ordered.

Awesome pricing and all of us left full.Since their bar was closed and I had a bartender buddy in the group, we sent him over to have a conversation with the owner. \u00a0Maybe he could tend their bar and make us drinks which we would then pay for? Surprisingly, they were cool about it and the owner requested a mixed drink as well. \u00a0After some conversation with him and his trying to sway us into ordering more of their specialty dishes, he decided to \"comp\" us on our drinks. Score! Initially we declined but he wouldn't take no. He thanked us for coming in and tried a second time to get us to order more. (At that point, we'd already ordered more dishes than necessary) (I would guess that having 3 attractive women in our group helped with the complimentary drinks, even otherwise, it was a nice gesture.) Regarding service; serving and time it took for plates to hit the table was not long. But to have a conversation and understanding with their waiters took a bit of patience. Also because many different waiters came around to the table, we weren't sure whom was or if there was a main waiter for our table. \u00a0There were a few instances of misunderstanding and an inability to find out whether they offered desserts or not.

Dim Sum is really the specialty here (my guess is this is why they got the Michelin recommendation -- not quite a star but still quite difficult to get). A smaller menu than what you'll find at Cai or Ming Hin, but every item is prepared consistently well although served at a slower pace. One complaint I do have about the menu is the lack of pictures for dim sum and not following the \u00a0standard naming convention of dishes in Chinatown (meaning it's more difficult to order some of your favorite items if you can't read Chinese). Even with some flaws, the superb quality of the food at a very reasonable price level easily gives this restaurant 5 stars.Some of my favorite dishes:Chaozhou style dumpling - Excellent combination of peanuts, ground pork, chives, and mushroom. Great combination of textures and flavors in a thicker skin.Mango pancake: Delicious fresh mango in a slightly sweet pancake Shui Mai: Cannot be missed, this is probably the best you'll find in Chicago. Full of flavor, juice, and a very bouncy texture.Fried dough: Very nice crispy exterior with a delicious pork meat filling inside. Sticky rice is chewy and fantastic.Lao's style shrimp dumpling: Nice big pieces of shrimp with a great texture and very clean flavor.Fried dough crepe: This an every other crepe they have has very nice thin bouncy skins filled with quality ingredients. This one stood out since it's uncommon for many restaurants to be able to keep the fried dough super crispy while being steamed by the crepe.Shanghai steamed stuffed bun: Better known as Xaio Long Bao, for me this wasn' the most amazing version I've had (could've used more juice and broth could've had more flavor) but it's a solid version.Mixed meat and peanut congee: Creamy congee and the mixed meat in here is delicious. Light but very enjoyable.Coconut red bean pudding: Superb combination. The coconut really brings out the flavor of the red bean. This really has no bitterness or starchy feel and is almost like eating a very nice ice cream (with a silky almost tofu like texture).BBQ pork bun: Fluffy bun with a very addictive BBQ pork filling that is just sweet enough to satisify your sweet tooth but just salty enough to bring out the flavor of the pork. The sauce in this is fantastic.Even if you aren't into dim sum, the dinner options are quite good here too. A bit lighter and more skillfully prepared dishes like tony three chili fish fillet, crispy rainbow fish flower, three kingdom steamed egg, and pork belly with pea leaves are good items to try.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 30]}, "56": {"description": "the server was nice to us , but the food was not good at all .

I get my congee and I'm waiting on the fried dough to eat it with. \u00a0Never get it, or my bf's noodle dish. \u00a0I asked a server about the two missing items, turns out they completely forgot about the fried dough. Fine whatever, I'm pretty full anyways, I'll just eat my congee without it. \u00a0Then 10 minutes later, we're done eating, still no noodle. I ask for the check thinking that maybe they just never put it in since the guy who took the noodle order was a totally different person than who took the rest of the order (again, crazy chaos). \u00a0Well...they still charged me for the missing noodle. I tell another different server about it, she tells me the noodles are ready and waiting in the kitchen (what?? so why did you never bring it out??). \u00a0She asked if I wanted to cancel the order and I said yes, we're done eating and all packed up. \u00a0So she goes to give me a new check, and directly behind her is another women who drops the noodle off at our table. \u00a0Ok....so maybe they're sorry about all the mistakes and just giving us the noodles? Nope, the last server comes back again and gives me the original check, telling me to pay for the noodles. \u00a0I'm not paying for something you forgot about, I told you to cancel and then you decide to bring out to me. \u00a0We get into an argument, she scolds me for messing up. \u00a0According to her, I should've never allowed the other server to even put the noodle down on our table. \u00a0But we were so confused by all the different people telling us different things, I had no idea what was going on. \u00a0After she finishes yelling at me for my \"mistakes\" she whisks our noodle away and angrily takes my credit card to pay for the meal. \u00a0Ugh....mess mess mess mess. \u00a0There's no way I'm going back.

You have to flag a waiter down to help you and nag them to get your food. Not once did a waiter come and ask us if everything was alright. What really pissed me off was that these girls sitting next to us ordered 15 minutes after we did and got their food immediately. The phone ringing is so loud you can hear it in the entire restaurant. Like it's on speakers or something. This older man that is clearly the manager runs around the restaurant, is frantic, and never stops to breathe. I saw him THROWING towels used to wipe tables to the waiters.My mom asked we could order more food. The guy literally replied with \"I don't know.\"I asked for water. He served me hot water in a glass clearly meant for cold water?! So I got up myself, located a glass, and poured my own glass of water. And I got up again to refill also. Service sucks.We ordered another thing and it didn't come until 20 minutes later. AND IT WASN'T WHAT WE ORDERED. HE BROUGHT THE WRONG THING. Not all speak chinese which is fine but a little problematic for a dim sum restaurant. Some just could not even understand what we wanted if said in english AND chinese. I literally saw a waiter standing there with his hands up like, \"what am I doing?\" CONCLUSION:The service was so bad it makes ME even feel bad. The manager does an absolutely terrible job managing because he doesn't even manage. What they need to do is calm down, regroup, and also retrain these boys. These boys were wandering around like lost puppies. They need to organize. Get assigned tables, learn how to pour glasses, how to time things right. Some waiters were better than others but honestly, it all fell to pieces because of the lack of structure.

Dim Sum is really the specialty here (my guess is this is why they got the Michelin recommendation -- not quite a star but still quite difficult to get). A smaller menu than what you'll find at Cai or Ming Hin, but every item is prepared consistently well although served at a slower pace. One complaint I do have about the menu is the lack of pictures for dim sum and not following the \u00a0standard naming convention of dishes in Chinatown (meaning it's more difficult to order some of your favorite items if you can't read Chinese). Even with some flaws, the superb quality of the food at a very reasonable price level easily gives this restaurant 5 stars.Some of my favorite dishes:Chaozhou style dumpling - Excellent combination of peanuts, ground pork, chives, and mushroom. Great combination of textures and flavors in a thicker skin.Mango pancake: Delicious fresh mango in a slightly sweet pancake Shui Mai: Cannot be missed, this is probably the best you'll find in Chicago. Full of flavor, juice, and a very bouncy texture.Fried dough: Very nice crispy exterior with a delicious pork meat filling inside. Sticky rice is chewy and fantastic.Lao's style shrimp dumpling: Nice big pieces of shrimp with a great texture and very clean flavor.Fried dough crepe: This an every other crepe they have has very nice thin bouncy skins filled with quality ingredients. This one stood out since it's uncommon for many restaurants to be able to keep the fried dough super crispy while being steamed by the crepe.Shanghai steamed stuffed bun: Better known as Xaio Long Bao, for me this wasn' the most amazing version I've had (could've used more juice and broth could've had more flavor) but it's a solid version.Mixed meat and peanut congee: Creamy congee and the mixed meat in here is delicious. Light but very enjoyable.Coconut red bean pudding: Superb combination. The coconut really brings out the flavor of the red bean. This really has no bitterness or starchy feel and is almost like eating a very nice ice cream (with a silky almost tofu like texture).BBQ pork bun: Fluffy bun with a very addictive BBQ pork filling that is just sweet enough to satisify your sweet tooth but just salty enough to bring out the flavor of the pork. The sauce in this is fantastic.Even if you aren't into dim sum, the dinner options are quite good here too. A bit lighter and more skillfully prepared dishes like tony three chili fish fillet, crispy rainbow fish flower, three kingdom steamed egg, and pork belly with pea leaves are good items to try.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 30]}, "41": {"description": "I bought 3 discounted coupons from Restaurants.com.

The manager apologized and said he will bring another one out.At this point, my gf was furious because she had already eaten one of the shrimp dumplings. I had to reassure her that ingesting a bit of raw shrimp isn't going to kill her and it would be okay. However, as soon as I realize the pork in the xiao long bao was also uncooked/undercooked, that was the end of it.When I showed the manager again, he said he'll brim another one out and that the bill will be on the house (it better be), but my gf was not willing to eat anything there anymore. The manager's explanation was that the chef who is normally in charge wasn't in yet and the person operating the steamer doesn't know the timings. That's ridiculous!

I had a wonderful experience with having dim sum here. The dishes are well made and taste delicious! Also, everything on the dim sum menu is under $4 (unless you go XL for portion size), and for $60, it fed a table of seven with extras leftover.It is very clean and has a trendy interior much like many newer restaurants in Chinatown. The waiters were very quick to refill water, bring out food, and remove empty plates. When we arrived, I noticed there were a lot of empty reserved tables, and towards the end of the meal, those tables were filled. The waiters were a bit rushed, but they managed to hold down the fort and not keep us waiting.Now for the food review: awesome! Perhaps by being part of a Chinese family, we can communicate well with the waiters and get the best dish recommendations, so I was very happy with the selections. Each dish was served piping hot from the kitchen and I savored every bite. It's also nice that they let you select which flavor of complimentary tea you get (jasmine, chrysanthemum, and a few others).Baked Pork Bun: Awesome, awesome, awesome! I highly recommend people get this. There are two types of pork bun: one is baked (golden brown colored) and the other is steamed (white-colored). While both are yummy, I prefer the baked buns. The baked pork buns came hot and had the perfect taste of freshly baked sweet bread and savory barbecue pork. It was heaven biting into it and getting to taste the succulent pork and fluffy bread.Lao's Beef Bun: I've never tried this before, but a waitress said it was really good, so we ordered it. Every bite was so worth it. It was sweet, juicy beef in steamed bread and reminded me of the steamed pork bun, but even yummier. Preserved Egg and Pork Congee: To diners who are scared of adding the sides provided with the congee. Try a bit! It adds a lot of different texture and flavor to the congee, which by itself is good to eat but since congee is just rice porridge, it's meant to be bland and flavored by the eater's choice of added ingredients. It was piping hot and smelled heavenly (just like how the cute Chinese grannies make it!) and while had a hint of saltiness along with sweetness.Cantonese Sponge Cake: Not the prettiest looking dish, but it tastes very good! This is a nice dessert for adults because unlike mango pudding, it has a light hint of sweetness that isn't overpowering and a fluffy texture that gives a melt in your mouth feeling as you eat it. It's also a generous serving of cake that can be shared among diners.Mango Pudding: I always order mango pudding as an end to my dim sum meal, so I had an idea of what to expect: a lump of generic mango gelatin with a covering of evaporated milk. To my surprise, it came out in four cute shapes and a generous cover of evaporated milk. To top it off, I bit into it and found they had put actual pieces of mango in the pudding! I appreciate the attention to detail put into what is usually an underrated dessert. Oddly, it also felt like I was eating a tasty, solid mango lassi.I hope I can come back soon for dim sum!

It is our preferred spot as Dr. Young, I presume is his name, that treats the sick and ailing. This is where I take my family to see the doctor when they come into town, and where I buy any type of non-western medicine. Dr. Young performs acupuncture and does cupping as well. His office is basically in the open and I sit and listen to the little Chinese that I can understand. There is a little makeshift room where acupuncture and cupping is done. He speaks Cantonese with my parents, but I do hear other people coming in and speaking Mandarin as well. He is very patient, and seems pretty knowledgeable as he asks them questions about their health and pain. My dad said he felt much better after the acupuncture was done to his leg since he wasn't the same after bowling. My sister has come here for bloating stomach issues, and my mom has come for an ailment as well. The medicine from here has also traveled to family friends in Minnesota who seem to agree that it has made them feel better as well. I do not get sick often (knock on wood) so I haven't been able to use the doctor's practice for my own advantage. I would certainly give him a shot since he seems to have cured my family and friends.

The bar area in front was empty on a Saturday night, so we stretched out, owned the dance floor, and started plugging in our own songs to the bar karaoke machine.The song selection was very minimal, and all the functions were (naturally) written in Simplified Chinese. If you can't read it, it never hurts to ask the service how to use the machine. (Un)fortunately, all of the songs we added to the queue weren't entirely instrumental versions. The two mic stands in the front were also very short, so it'd be difficult to move about and dance if you're singing. But you can still drop it low.Overall, song selection is not up to date, but has most hits you'd find from the past three decades.Drinks here were basic for any karaoke bar. I definitely suggest pre-gaming a but before coming, and if you're okay with the open lounge in front, take advantage! You'll end up singing and dancing without the need to pay more for a private space.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 1, 10]}, "2": {"description": "As a group of three, we arrived there at 2pm after having lunch in Chinatown.

There are different sized rooms (small, medium, large, VIP) and there are no room rates, just a minimum amount you have to spend. We had a large room for 20 people, and it was $400 from 11 PM - 3 AM (this is the time slot they have available. Earlier one is from ~6:30 to 10PM).For the music system, there is a touch screen computer in the corner and luckily one of our friends is Chinese and could help us, because the buttons are in Chinese. But we learned the right buttons to hit and search artists/songs and then it was no problem.The English music selection is great for pop hits. There were some classics that my friends were looking for and they weren't available.Beer is ~$5 and cocktails are ~$10. Beware of the mixed drinks, it seemed like they were over the board - either barely any alcohol or a lot of alcohol.Another thing is our room was really hot - we had to have the door cracked for a bit to get some fresh air.

There is a minimum charge of $15 per person in the lobby. Either order up to $15 worth of drinks per person or just pay the $15, which is a very standard price charge for Chinatown. The lobby was very spacious with black leather couches and flashing neon, disco lights. People were courteous in taking turns to sing and servers were very helpful.A room finally opened up at 12am and we immediately switched over. It is $48 per hour but the rate increases after 2am. There is no minimum charge other than the room rate. You are not obligated to order any food and drinks. We tried the lamb skewers, beef skewers, grilled squid, lychee juice, mango juice, and a variety of beer. The lamb and beef skewers tasted good, but the texture was very ground-meat-like and the cumin smell was a bit unusual. I was glad we only ordered a few to try. The lychee juice and mango juice can be ordered in pitchers at $12 each. Each pitcher was 50% ice but they were good with the lychee juice being sweeter. With the two-hour stay, drinks, and food, we each paid approximately $25. The room is also very spacious and can easily fit 20 people with plenty more space to go around. Furthermore, they only have two unisex bathrooms towards the back. They are also very spacious but there is always a line! They weren't too busy last night but imagine if the place was packed. You would never make it through the line before your bladder explodes! The bathrooms are obviously very new but not a bit clean. Towels were rolled out of their dispensers and left laying on the floor in a wet puddle and the garbage cans were spilling over. I hope the Richland Center has more bathrooms elsewhere in the building... \u00a0 \u00a0In conclusion, our group had a pleasant time. We stayed from 9:30pm to 2am and more people were arriving as we were leaving.

They could be considered healthier though. Also, I did not like the dipping sauce. Personally, I don't like hoisin sauce. Other places mix the sauce with peanut butter, which hides the flavor for me. This sauce was just plain hoisin. I also thought the crab rangoon wasn't that flavorful. It was lacking salt and I didn't see any green onions. The wrapper was a lot harder than what I'm used to. Usually they have bubbles when they're fried so it's very light and flaky. I also think the rangoon was not stuffed as full as it could have been.For the main course, I ordered seafood pho. I think the broth was pretty good. I feel like they skimped on the seafood, lime and vegetables though. I like to dump vegetables in mine because it makes me feel healthy. You could tell the seafood came from a frozen bag. It was not fresh, which I should expect because I'm in the Midwest. However, the shrimp should have been fresh and deveined. The last thing I ordered was a mango fruit smoothie. It was tasty but I could tell that it wasn't fresh because the fibers weren't present. Either they used a can or a powder mix.

We thought this was a good sign that they were busy. Since we were a large group we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. They placed us in a table too small for 3 adults and 4 kids. Luckily the table next to us left and we took over the table for 2. We waited another 10 minutes for glasses of water. Then we waited some more for someone to take our order but no one stopped at our table so we had to stop a waitress to ask if someone can take our order. I don't know how a waitress can ignore a table with 4 tired and hungry kids, but maybe that's why no one stopped at our table (?). I had to say something to another waitress about us waiting for service and she said they were busy. True, but I can also see a staff of 4 other women walking around the restaurant. The food was good. We had pho, ban xeo, egg rolls, spring rolls and shrimp rolls. The ban xeo had a little more thicker batter than I care for. I prefer them to be light and crisp. The pho was good unfortunately, at the end of enjoying her bowl of pho, my friend discovered a long piece of hair. We showed a waitress and she didn't apologize to it but took the cost of it off our bill. Ugh. Watch out for the floors too! They wet and felt greasy.

I've come to the conclusion that service is poor and I'll begin looking for other restaurants that serve pho in the Chinatown area. Positives: pho is cheap and plentiful.Service is extremely poor. Customers seat themselves so it's good that we can pick our own tables. The place was practically empty, yet there were dirty tables and plenty of staff (or people who seemed to work there) who could have cleaned the tables but didn't. What were they waiting for? There were only 2 tables there, and it took 5 minutes before the server came to our table to take our order. We weren't given any cups of water on our last visit on a Friday night. We tried to make eye contact with the server several times but she looked down and continued to do whatever personal thing she was doing behind the counter. Pho is okay if you have a craving for it and can't think of anywhere else to go nearby. I usually get the small pho with steak and brisket. The beef brisket is quite fatty and there isn't much meat in the bowl (maybe about 5 thin slices of meat). However, the bean sprouts are crunchy and jalapeno peppers are fresh and spicy. Mint leaves are washed and fresh. Lime is juicy.Portions are big. A small will fill you up quite well. A large is too much and can be shared between 2 people for healthy portions. The soup is hot. The Sriracha and Hoisin sauce on the table seemed to be old as the top was crusted and sticky from the sauce. I'm glad the sauces were offered.

The decor is really new and fresh compared to the other restaurants in the area, which are very outdated. The servers were quick and brought our food and check as soon as we were ready.Despite those winning qualities, I thought the food was mediocre. Keep in mind that I have eaten a lot of Vietnamese dishes, so I can be very critical. I ordered shrimp spring rolls and I thought there was too much lettuce and barely any noodles. They could be considered healthier though. Also, I did not like the dipping sauce. Personally, I don't like hoisin sauce. Other places mix the sauce with peanut butter, which hides the flavor for me. This sauce was just plain hoisin. I also thought the crab rangoon wasn't that flavorful. It was lacking salt and I didn't see any green onions. The wrapper was a lot harder than what I'm used to. Usually they have bubbles when they're fried so it's very light and flaky. I also think the rangoon was not stuffed as full as it could have been.For the main course, I ordered seafood pho. I think the broth was pretty good. I feel like they skimped on the seafood, lime and vegetables though. I like to dump vegetables in mine because it makes me feel healthy. You could tell the seafood came from a frozen bag. It was not fresh, which I should expect because I'm in the Midwest. However, the shrimp should have been fresh and deveined. The last thing I ordered was a mango fruit smoothie. It was tasty but I could tell that it wasn't fresh because the fibers weren't present. Either they used a can or a powder mix. Also, it was was sugary because I could feel the sugar grains when I slurped up the drink. It wasn't the best but I'm okay with the drink.Overall, the environment is great. Remember, I'm pretty critical when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. However, this place was packed and with a lot of different types of people.

However, once you're inside the restaurant opens up into a large modern staircase and an elegant dining room decorated with modern Chinese decor. I was really surprised when I walked in.I tried all of the dishes my student recommended. I might be forgetting something but I think I tried the following: frog legs, tree fungus, pork skin, cold steamed chicken, crab and tofu soup, ma po tofu, eggplant in garlic sauce, whole steamed fish, pork ribs, and these potatoes that were sliced thin like noodles. I can't recall the name of that last dish but it was delicious. I've never had anything like that. You slurp up some noodles but it's like eating a baked potato. The tree fungus was probably my favorite. It was like a Chinese salad made with mushrooms and herbs. It was a great way to start the feast. The eggplant was really popular with my group. Everyone ate a lot of it. I even took some home. Also, the pork ribs were especially noteworthy. The meat was so tender!The frog legs and pork skin weren't my favorite. I'm adventurous so I'll try anything. However, the season on the pork skin was very unusual and I didn't care for it.

The design was more modern than most of the restaurants in Chinatown and there were many tables. The restaurant was empty, and a waiter seated us immediately. As my whole family was looking at the menu, in less than 4 minutes the waiter asked to take our order. We kindly asked for a few more minutes. The menu had a wide variety of spicy foods, a menu with noodles and a menu with spicy pork and steak caught my eyes. Again, within 2 minutes the waiter asked to take our order. Now realize this is our first time in the restaurant, as I assume for most folks also because this is a fairly new restaurant (less than 2 months.) We kindly asked for a few more minutes. Our orders were finally taken, and within 5 minutes our appetizers came out, I was amazed at the speed our food came out, probably because it was a cold dish. Within another 10 minutes, the remaining of our dishes arrived. Fast food is always a plus. Now this is the part that ruined my experience. We ordered 3 bowls of noodles, and 2 appetizers, along with a dish of greens. The 3 bowls of noodles were amazing along with the 2 appetizers. As my Mom was eating from the plate of greens she stopped and closely looked at her plate. She then pushed it aside. I asked whats wrong and she said there was a bug in the greens. I quickly analyzed the dish and realized there was a maggot-like bug on top of the greens. I'm not the type of person to make a huge fuss out of unclean food, so I calmly waived the waiter over. The waiter had a shocked look and took the plate into the kitchen. Another worker then came BACK with the plate and explained why bugs were in the greens. The explanation was bugs are common in greens, and these bugs are completely EDIBLE. I'm not exaggerating what she said, I'm quoting. She said the bugs were common and EDIBLE. I don't know how many customers enjoy the view of bugs on their food and eating the bugs; but I don't think I'd ever voluntarily ask for bugs and eat bugs. Our family dinner ended right then and there, we asked for a check. And surprisingly they gave us our check, with no type of apology or compensation. A simple apology would have been better, but not one was given. They didn't offer to cook up another dish or ask if we wanted to order another dish either, so that is why a 1 star was given.Overall experience - Restaurant design/layout very nice- Food was good other than the bug in the greens- Felt rushed while looking at our menu, we were the only table within the restaurant. \u00a0That experience would be my first and last experience at Sze Chuan Restaurant.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 10, 16]}, "1": {"description": "This place does not even deserve a 1 star rating, wanted to give them a negative star for being clueless in managing an even small place. Been here couple times before, never had any experience that is better than mediocre each time, the only reason that we ended up at this place tonight was that we were seeking Szechuan food in Chinatown and didn't want to patron Lao's arrogant crap. Never bothered to write them reviews for negative experience during the prior visits, but this time I ended up with serious upset stomach immediately afterward, and the service from the staff here this time was simply brain dead, absolutely horrible. You could get more interactive and friendlier service at a restaurant that is fully staffed with robots than you would get at this place. Not a joke!Let me summarize a few points: (1) as we walked in there were a half a dozen ppl waiting for table, the host seem annoyed by our entrance, no greets from the host standing there like a robot, no communication of any available table or wait time. Didn't see why she's worth her pay. (2) after we sat down I clearly asked the waiter for iced water, waiter had no response, as he walked away I assumed he was going to get water, nope, standing there chatting and laughing with sleepy co-workers was a priority for him. Later he came back with no water, I had to ask again. (3) I asked for a fork, then few minutes later the sleepy waiter came back with a plastic fork, so fancy! For a moment I thought I was at Panda Express, maybe all of our dishes were going to be served on paper plates as well. I had to ask again for a real fork. (4) we asked for a Coke, a different waiter came back with a can of Coke and dropped it at the corner edge of the table and rushed away as if the place was on fire. (5) food quality: I got serious upset stomach immediately afterward, need I say more?There are plenty of restaurants in Chinatown with decent food, but most of them are just lacking the effort to focus more on the service quality. Not training the waitstaff to the standard or not disciplining sleepy waiters are primarily the faults of the management.

FOOD: I always give this word of warning about Sichuan food - it is often drowned in chili oil and has a very unique heat - \"ma la\" or \"numbing spice\". For those who are unfamilar with this spice, or if you'd like to limit your oil intake, you may not love this place. The dishes here are a hit or...just okay. One dish served here in particular that has impressed me is the \"Twice Cooked Pork\" (hui guo rou) - a fatty, slightly spicy, aromatic dish saut\u00e9ed with leeks. The pork has a similar texture and taste as a thick slab of medium cooked bacon. Another popular Sichuan dish done fairly well here is the \"Hot and Spicy Diced Chicken Chong Qing Style\". Yes, it may look intimidating with all the red peppers, but its not as bad as it looks. The chicken is fried, so think Asian style spicy KFC...but infinitely better and in smaller pieces.My favorite dish that blew me away is something not on the menu, and definitely falls under the category of \"adventure dining\" - I'll leave my comments out, but ask the server about dishes not their menu if you're interested. The only dishes that disappointed me so far was the \"Sichuan Cold Noodles\" (Liang Fen) because the sauce was overly salted instead of spicy and the portion was fairly small, and the free spring rolls for checking in - but hey, can't complain too much about free food.PRICE: Very fair. It's always been less than $20/person (including tip). Pay in cash if you can!SERVICE: You're at a Chinese restaurant - what do you expect? No one will be checking on you every few minutes, but the second you wave someone will becon your call. ATMOSPHERE: Impressive decor inside with the attempt to look upscale. Agree with other reviewers though - \u00a0bathrooms could be better maintained.What I love most about this place though is that the menu is very expansive, covering all of Sichuan's most popular authentic dishes.

Everyone ate a lot of it. I even took some home. Also, the pork ribs were especially noteworthy. The meat was so tender!The frog legs and pork skin weren't my favorite.

It came with egg roll, crab Rangoon, egg drop soup, and hot and sour soup. I waited a long time for my appetizers, which were the soups and the egg roll and Rangoon. Then it finally came. I was starving. The hot and sour soup and egg drop soup was worth mentioning. I've tasted a lot of soups around in New York and a lot of fast food Chinese restaurants water down the soups. Each of the soup was thick in taste and included lots of condiments. The egg roll and Rangoon was just average. After being served the soup, I waited an extra 15 minutes before being served the main course. Our first main course was the sweet and sour chicken. The waiter said he was going to come back quickly with the rice so I can have something to eat with the chicken. I waited for 8 minutes and I had to ask another waitress to get me the rice. Then I waited another 10 minutes for my chicken chop suey?! They got the order wrong, I ordered shrimp chop suey!This restaurant needs to adjust their cooking method. As I was waiting for my food, I realized that they cook all the food for a specific table and make the rest of the tables wait. One of the tables beside mine was being served constantly, about every 5 minutes with new dishes like Cantonese Lobster, Bak Choy, and steamed fish.

Of the dim sum places I've eaten at (and while I'm no expert on it I certainly have experience having eaten it nearly every other day for a year in the area (living close by and joining the girlfriend's family with regularity) and having enjoyed \"authentic\" dim sum during my travels in Hong Kong) Mayflower may not have been the best overall but certainly is one of my preferred haunts.The food is pretty good. Dim sum comes in standard portions and with tea (we usually get chrysanthemum, though they brought me Lipton once which I thought was rather funny though slightly rude) and crystalized sugar. They generally leave chopsticks at the table and don't ask if you need a fork if you're over fifteen, which is really quite nice (I've used chopsticks since I was six and can peel oranges with them), and the servers tend to treat you as competent. If you know how to order you'll be just fine. I'd recommend the salt and pepper softshell crab, which has been a little salty on occasion but is usually well balanced. The curried squid is the best I've had, though the portions for vegetable dishes are a little sparser than I'd like.This is family-style, so order a variety of dishes and experiment.The prices are lower than the nearby Ming Hin and tastes about the same, making it a better buy if you are looking for a meal, however the atmosphere is considerably less formal. If you don't like being packed in it may be best to visit later in the afternoon as the mornings and evenings get rather busy with families.Bonus points for the lack of moronic tourists in paddy-hats (it's Chicago, not Shandong).OVERALL: This place is worth a visit if you're looking for a good place \u00a0to grab a bite.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 7, 29]}, "7": {"description": "Best place for Dim sum always top notch.

I can't go more than 2 months without it. I thought, how can I go wrong by going here. I can. It's by going without an Asian friend in tow. First off, I placed over an hour on the meter, dim sum is typically fast so... should be enough time. This place wasn't so fast though. We got there around 2:40 which is the end of dim sum and I asked them if they were still serving (this after waiting over 10 minutes to be acknowledged, even thought there were 4 people walking around in the dining area) one young lady said yes and showed us to a table. Tea was brought out immediately which was a plus but then we waited another 10+ minutes for them to take our order even though the sheet was completely filled out! 15 -20 minutes later, all the food came out at once. Mind you, we were starving and now it's about 40 minutes that we're here. Half the food was cold. I was so disappointed but were so hungry that we just started scarfing stuff down. We were adventurous and tried the quail egg and pork siu mai (not so great - very eggy, e-yu! The deep fried shrimp ball, ah, where's the shrimp? The shrimp crepe was typical as was the taro root cake although both were cold and very gelatinous. Whatever, I'll eat cold dim sum at home too but going out, I expect things to be at the correct serving temperature. That's what we get for showing up late! Darn the stupid bathroom break on the Eisenhower.The plus: taro root puff was just wonderful (even when cold!). The shrimp rolls were decent and the rice crepe with crispy skin was very unique. I'm trying to have at least one new thing each time I go for dim sum so we had the fried lotus root cake which was different and OK. As far as the cost, it was decent, $32 for 2 with a 25% tip. Not sure why I tipped so much if they really didn't even care that we were there. Darn these server ethics of mine! It's not like they were even busy! The rush was already gone.

I visited on a Sunday afternoon and no one - aside from my best friend and I me - ordered actual entrees.Location/Decor - placed near the entrance of Wentworth, it is kinda hard not to notice Mayflower Restaurant.

Easy for clean up. But if you are going to have table cloths, don't ruin their classiness with paper coverings.Service - the servers here are rude. My friend was unsure of what she wanted so it took us a while. The final time she came to receive our order, she sounded so annoyed. We felt as if we were being forced to order. Well once we got the food she did not come to refill our waters. She definitely did not ask if we needed anything else. I was annoyed and I was prepared not to tip (I know..how horrible of me). Where I come from, you work for your tips. I did not feel valued as a customer therefore I did not feel the need to tip for her lackluster service. Well, the insane part is, she literally chased me as we were exiting and told me that I forgot to tip her. I said, \"no, I didn't.\" and she yelled something in Mandarin and stormed away. (This alone will be the reason why I will not return).Drinks - tea was piping hot. Tasty. Perfect for a cold Sunday afternoon.Food - pretty good. my least favorite of the places I have tried in Chinatown though.*Mongolian Beef - 3 stars. Really lovely spicy sauce. Chewy beef.

I was unhappy with my entree and expected something different by the name of the dish. The dinners came with nothing. Usually, an egg roll and soup are included, at least at the restaurants I frequent. The only thing that came with my food was plain rice. A veggie entree, with barely any veggies, and a small bowl of rice cost a disappointing $9.25. Drinks were very mediocre. My Long Island Ice Tea contained \u00a0more ice than anything else. I thought that maybe I made the wrong choice, because my friends' food looked good. Sadly, everything lacked seasoning and was beyond bland.

But I didn't. The frames are quite expensive. I know I could have gotten a better deal somewhere else, like America's Best. They even charged $100 for the very basic lens, where I believe it should be free, like America's Best and Coastal.com, where I found the EXACT same frame I choose from BOSS for more than HALF the price and free lens of course. Oh well, nothing else I can do besides not purchasing from them anymore.1 Making an appointment was not that bad. I just called and BAM, see you next week.2 Reminding me that I have an appointment via text message was bad. Luckily I have unlimited text, else I would have to pay for that unwanted text, which they did not even mentioned about.3 On the day of the appointment, I went 15 minutes earlier as instructed, but it was still close to closing hour. I walked in, but none of the office assistants or the owner welcomed me or ask if I needed anything. So, I walked to the front desk, which is somewhere in the BACK..., and told them I have an appointment. They told me to wait and gave me some forms to fill, the basic form with my information and some more important forms. However, the important forms were laminated and probably used over and over again. I signed it with a dry erase marker, I think they erase it after I don't see the form again. I am happy that they are going green, but I rather have an actual form and sign it and have them keep it as a record, not for the sake of just signing. After the forms, I went somewhere further back in a narrow hallway where the office assistant Wendy Mei did a basic test. I think she knew what she was doing, I hope. After that test, she told me to wait, and I tried to find a seat, but it seems impossible. One couch with two seats, that is it., and it is already occupied. No extra chairs laying around? Since there is nowhere to sit, I just looked around at the frame and try to see which one I might get. They did not offer any suggestions or what so ever. I mean, they are the \"professionals\" there, maybe a few questions can help narrow the choices to maybe only 5 out of the few hundred. It was not long until I was called in to take the REAL eye exam.4. My doctor was Dr. Nancy Suen, which I think is the only professional in that place, maybe including other doctor that I did not see. Well, she was a beautiful young lady. I was blinded by her beauty (pun intended). She greeted me and shook hands and asked a few personal questions, just to make a friendly atmosphere, which was great, I got to let her know more about me! So after a little chit chat, we went to the real business. We went through the same procedure and any other eye doctors would do, with a few extra here and there. She was very patience, even though it passed the business hours. I made some mistakes along the way and she did not mind. We just do it again until we get it. She explained what she will do before doing the test and made sure I understood. She ever told me that if the prescription does not feel right, I can come back and fix it or change it free of charge. After the wonderful time with Dr. Suen, (enjoyable time pass so fast...), I had to go out and pick my frame.5 So, Wendy Mei told me pick the frame I want, still did not ask me some questions to give me some suggestions. Nope, she just stood there by her desk and waited for me to walked around, looking at me with her impatient face. I know it is after business hours, but you allowed me to make an appointment at that time, then you are bounded to give me sufficient time and make my pick, even if that means you have to stay longer. Well, I finally came to a choice, under so much pressure from her watching me. She explained the pricing and surprised me with the pricing of the lens, which I thought there wouldn't be. Come on, a Benjamin Franklin for the most, extremely, simple basic lens? The total came to be over $330. Even subtracting the voucher, the final price is still over $100. I could have gotten two pairs at America's Best. I do not care about named brands, I am better off saving 70%-80% of what I spent. Too bad, I came so far, I just paid the remaining amount and left. She said it will come in a week.6 A week later, they TEXTED me again to tell me my glasses arrived and I can come pick it up! Oh no, again, I am glad I have unlimited text. What happened to calling and telling me directly? I want to feel special, I want to hear your feeling when you tell me my precious glasses arrived and you will be happy to see me come get the glasses. Well, I went the day after and got my glasses, this time, the office assistant was Jenny Mei. I tried it on and left within 2 minutes. She asked if I needed any adjustment. I thought, um, I would like to wear it for a length of time before making any adjustment, why don't I just come back if I need to make adjustment.

Every single time I went, the coating was a different price for example. Sometimes it was included in the lens cost and sometimes it wasn't. She lied and said it was never included but I have receipts from when my brother got glasses so be wary.

But otherwise, you might as well go to somewhere else sans coupon and it'll be better and don't have to haggle. 2) I would even say don't get the coating because she's going to push it for it, but it really sucks. It seems to wear out easily but that could be the way I treat my glasses. 3) the contact lens exams are always a different price as well. When I negotiated last time I got glasses, I got quoted $100, $75, $50(final negotiated price). I never followed up for my second fitting after a year, so they decide to charge me $115 instead because I have astigmatism.

Let's Go! We walk through the doors and the place is so nice and warm, I forget how cold it is outside. We thaw out with hot tea and drool over the menu. I notice they don't have a very big dim sum menu but it will do.We started with the crispy pork belly. O.M.G. - crispy is no lie. The skin was super crunchy and the meat awesomely fatty and to make it even worse for your health, they give you sugar to dip it in. Mmmmm. Must try this. We then ordered the shrimp har gow dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf, egg bun, spare ribs, chicken & dried scallop bun and the tofu skin filled with meat and veggies. Everything was great. At first, they didn't give us any chili and I LOVE the chili sauce so I asked if they had any. They were holding out! There chili sauce was delish! It had a lot of different spices and tiny dried shrimp and tasted different than the normal red kind you get at Chinese restaurants but was amazing. Not as spicy though. So the moral of the story is - if they don't give you any - ask! We went back for lunch one day and the place was packed but the wait was still short. They have a really good system down and all the staff seem to work together. I would say that this place has one of the friendliest services of the Chinese restaurants I have been to. The menu is more extensive than the late night menu (yay). We ordered the pork belly again. Obvy. BUT, they forgot to bring it to us. We were disappointed but also a tiny bit relieved b/c we realized we ordered too much. So, we didn't ask for it. We got the taro cakes which I liked but are a bit dry. The egg custard tart which were really good but super sweet. The shrimp noodle crepe was good and had big shrimp in it. The spare ribs with noodle roll ball were disappointing. The spare ribs were not tender like how they are in the black bean sauce. They looked the same but were super tough and chewy. Did not like.

The food is fresh and comes out quickly. They also have a full bar, and a specialty cocktail list. Both times I've gone, someone has come over to ask about my drink and see if I had any feedback. The first time I had a drink called the Almond Joy, which had pineapple, Malibu rum, and grenadine. It was tasty, but the feedback I offered was that it was missing chocolate if you were naming it after a candy bar, and I'd like to see some Godiva liqueur and not grenadine to line it up with the name expectation. I forget the name of the drink I had on the second visit, but it was pretty strong, which the staff could tell by my nursing of it throughout the meal. Overall, the food is very good, the staff are friendly and fast, and the prices are pretty reasonable for the quality.

The larger pieces of pork in the middle were and we hardly touched the stuff. There were a lot of smaller and shredded saucy stuff that totally made up for it, though, and that was delicious!

The big fresh veggies were the best part.Salt and Pepper Squid:The flavor was alright, but I much prefer the flavor and texture of Prawn. Not Ming Hin's fault: I blame this on my +1 who suggested I try something different. Seafood Fried Rice:Very bland and very oily. There was good distribution of seafood, which was cooked well, but overall disappointing. I'm not big on salt, but soy sauce was necessary when reheating.2- Meat Platter: Pork Belly and Duck:The duck was delicious. Not a huge fan of the Pork Belly. I've had it before and know it's supposed to be deliciously fatty, but this was a teeeeny bit of pork between two giant layers of fat and with a slight crust. \u00a0Tried dissecting it for my leftovers and the minescule bit of pork wasn't worth the effort.Pea Tips with Preserved Egg:The veggies themselves were good, but there was very little preserved egg. There was, however, a sh!t ton of what turned out to be tenderized bamboo, (?!) which is apparently a new addition. I'm not one to ever be turned off by texture, but this was absolutely gross.Shrimp and Chive Potsticker dim sum:Meh, they were OK.

The service here is actually pretty good, and all of them speak to you in pretty good English. The workers here don't seem to all speak Cantonese, which is surprising to me.

The Golden Bull Restaurant is a tiny, reasonably decorated place. The menu is quite expansive and does have a little but of everything. An appealing factor is that they have set menus for x-number of people, which is more than enough to share. A few qualms I have about the place is that there is only street/meter parking out. You can find additional parking in the lot by where the train tracks are. You have to ask for ice water. It's assumed you will have hot tea with your meal. Service of preparing the food is also slow, even though I know it is fresh and made to order, I would like some speediness to my food. If you are a traditionalist and are looking for the stone pot sticky rice, place that order as soon as you walk in because it takes 40 minutes to prep/cook this dish of deliciousness. If you want the hand shredded chicken, also place that order in the minute you walk in because they literally hand shred half a chicken for that dish and it will take 30 minutes to prep and season the dish. We had ordered the dinner for 3, which came with 3 beef & barley soups to start, we decided with the beef with Chinese broccoli, stir fry lobster, and instead of the sweet and sour pork, we went with the spiced salt and pepper pork. Beef & barley soup: clear beef broth, barley beans, carrots, and little chunks of beef. It wasn't overly salty, but had a delicate flavor to it.Beef with Chinese broccoli: Beef is pretty standard, wasn't overly impress with the quality of the meat or the flavoring of it. Did enjoy the heaping helping of leafy Chinese broccoli, and stem. We did pick out all of the veggies in this dish. Stir fry lobster: This was my favorite dish. The lobster was sweet, juicy, and tender. \u00a0A bit on the small side, but a solid piece of shellfish. The sauce that the lobster was cooked in was decadent in flavor. It was rich and creamy due to the fact that I think cornstarch was added as a thickener. The sauce had egg and pork in it. So if you're a non-pork eater, I would check with the server if they can make it without it, otherwise, it is just delicious and a must order. Just keep in mind that you have to work for your meal here.Spiced salt & pepper pork: I love this dish. It's battered with lightly and seasoned very well. It is \"deep fried\" in the wok, and the meat is tender and juicy. They garnish this this with some sauteed jalapenos. Hand shredded chicken: We got this dish last. Like after we killed our first 3 dishes, this one came out last. We were already full. I'm not sure if it was because I was full I would this dish to be overly salty in some parts, and under seasoned in other parts. But I think I will have to give this dish another chance the next time I visit.Taro & tapioca dessert soup: Kind of bland and flavorless goop.

The Golden Bull Restaurant is a tiny, reasonably decorated place. The menu is quite expansive and does have a little but of everything. An appealing factor is that they have set menus for x-number of people, which is more than enough to share. A few qualms I have about the place is that there is only street/meter parking out. You can find additional parking in the lot by where the train tracks are. You have to ask for ice water. It's assumed you will have hot tea with your meal. Service of preparing the food is also slow, even though I know it is fresh and made to order, I would like some speediness to my food. If you are a traditionalist and are looking for the stone pot sticky rice, place that order as soon as you walk in because it takes 40 minutes to prep/cook this dish of deliciousness. If you want the hand shredded chicken, also place that order in the minute you walk in because they literally hand shred half a chicken for that dish and it will take 30 minutes to prep and season the dish. We had ordered the dinner for 3, which came with 3 beef & barley soups to start, we decided with the beef with Chinese broccoli, stir fry lobster, and instead of the sweet and sour pork, we went with the spiced salt and pepper pork. Beef & barley soup: clear beef broth, barley beans, carrots, and little chunks of beef. It wasn't overly salty, but had a delicate flavor to it.Beef with Chinese broccoli: Beef is pretty standard, wasn't overly impress with the quality of the meat or the flavoring of it. Did enjoy the heaping helping of leafy Chinese broccoli, and stem. We did pick out all of the veggies in this dish. Stir fry lobster: This was my favorite dish. The lobster was sweet, juicy, and tender. \u00a0A bit on the small side, but a solid piece of shellfish. The sauce that the lobster was cooked in was decadent in flavor. It was rich and creamy due to the fact that I think cornstarch was added as a thickener. The sauce had egg and pork in it. So if you're a non-pork eater, I would check with the server if they can make it without it, otherwise, it is just delicious and a must order. Just keep in mind that you have to work for your meal here.Spiced salt & pepper pork: I love this dish. It's battered with lightly and seasoned very well. It is \"deep fried\" in the wok, and the meat is tender and juicy. They garnish this this with some sauteed jalapenos. Hand shredded chicken: We got this dish last. Like after we killed our first 3 dishes, this one came out last. We were already full. I'm not sure if it was because I was full I would this dish to be overly salty in some parts, and under seasoned in other parts. But I think I will have to give this dish another chance the next time I visit.Taro & tapioca dessert soup: Kind of bland and flavorless goop. I've had this at other establishments and it was amazing. Here, not so much. Maybe it was an off day.Overall experience, food, service, cleanliness, etc is a 3 star.

We got a small portion of the surf clams with vermicelli and cilantro, the shredded farmer's chicken, chives with fish cake and dried tofu aiming off the top of their specials. All very good dishes (though I think we missed the tofu in the chives dish, but there was plenty of fish cake to compensate). They do provide flexibility in portion sizes (small, large, etc) - we went with the large for the chives dish and half chicken - so that gives you flexibility on budget and whether you want some leftovers for home (and a better deal). Thrown in, a house soup starter too, decent rice and tea. Experienced staff person handled everything at the front of the house though admittedly while we were there it was only two tables total (maybe this is more a dinner spot and everyone was somewhere hip - and less tasty - or having dim sum.)I'm assuming because we were there for lunch that dessert soup wasn't offered.

It was also impressive that they had xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and liu sha bao, since those are items rarely found in Chinese restaurants in America.

I had to wait around 20 minutes, but thankfully, my party of 5 got a table to ourselves (I've had to share before, unfortunately). Cai uses a paper ordering system instead of having employees push the traditional carts around, so we couldn't just point to what we wanted and eat it right away. After submitting the order, some of the items came out within minutes, but we had to wait another 15 minutes for the rest of the dishes to come.

I finally decided to visit the restaurant and I was so enthusiastic about the experience...until we walked through the door. I don't know if it was just because It was a Sunday morning at 11, or because the Lunar New Year Parade was in a couple of hours, or if the dim sum is this stellar, or a combination of the three, but I was NOT prepared and I was NOT okay with how many people were packed inside of this restaurant. Standing room only is truly an understatement. Location - Cai is located on floor 2 in the New Chinatown complex. From the Red Line CTA stop closest to the complex, it is definitely not an intuitive entrance. My friend and I ended up talking the employee back entrance into the restaurant and it was sketch major! They should have had a sign on the door informing patrons that the formal entrance was through a different door. The ease of access we received entering the restaurant has me convinced that there have to be many instances of people skipping the lines and jumping into an open table. And because of how PACKED this place was Sunday morning, one would have great trouble convincing me that the staff would even notice.Decor - resembles Phoenix to me. Big wide open space with standard Chinese/Cantonese decor covering the walls. Elegant light fixtures. Plastic tables with cloth coverings and then paper coverings on top of those (a tad ratchet if you ask me...). Carpeted. Which was awkward. How do they keep the floors cleaned?! Service - okay. I have to give Cai the benefit of the doubt. There were a few hundred people in this restaurant Sunday. There is absolutely no possible way to provide A+mazing customer service to this many people in this small of a space...I don't care what anyone says. However, I shouldn't have to get out of my chair to ask for a water refill. Definitely NOT O-Cai! I really wish also that dim sum items were all served at the same time. To me it is so frustrating to have the items coming out at all different times because sometimes I find myself getting full or tired of eating before the rest of the good stuff comes out. At that point I find myself over-eating. And I do this solely because I truly have a hard time believing dim sum to be good eats when reheated. The hostesses were hilarious though. And sassy. Love it.Food - I made sure to do my research on dim sum and what to order before I came to Cai. So I was prepared to do damage major that day! I am going to review each item in order from best to worst (from my point of view). Even though everything was good there were certainly spectacular and not so great dishes.*Siu mai - plump, juicy, perfectly fresh shrimp and pork and delicious skin. Mixed with the sweet chili sauce this was easily my favorite meal because of all of the delicious flavors going on at once. *BBQ Pork Buns - I just really love the pastry from steamed bbq bao. The bbq pork was flavorful. I cared not one bit for the abalone sauce so I ate them plain. They were not a bit warm though. Deduction.*Baked Green Chive Puffs - these were phenom! They have a big plump piece of shrimp in the inside mixed with the chives and other filling. Outside wonton were perfectly crispy and buttery and crunchy*Lo mai gai (sticky rice with chicken wrapped in lotus leaf) - DELICIOUS! First time having and I am a huge fan. the sticky rice was piping hot and the the aroma of the lotus leaf and the soaked flavor from the leaf as well made for good eats. I DO have a huge issue with Cai using the worst and old part of chicken. Had they opted for fresh breast meat, this would have been my favorite. But I CAN tell when old and the bad parts of the chicken are being used. Nice try Cai.*Stuffed bean curd skin with pork and shrimp - LOVED these to be honest. Its like a super soggy eggroll. Im not sure what sauce was soaked this dish, but it tasted something straight from the south...like some sort of chicken and dumpling broth. Its hard to explain but it worked. My only complaint was that it was a bit hard to consume - mess free - with the chopsticks. No worries. No one can help that I guess. Still very tasty.(These next three were not so great. Still following the order from best to worst) *Crispy shrimp rolls - these were the first to reach the table. They were not hot. Nor juicy. Nor fresh. Had they been, they would have been tasty. *Steamed beef meatball - way too much cilantro and the beef was mushy. Had to smother it in sriracha.*Pan fried pot stickers - the worst pot stickers I have ever had to be honest. Price - Just over $19 with tip for two people.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 2, 15]}, "55": {"description": "Meh.The wait was ridiculous, to get a seat and to receive food.

If there's one thing you must get, it's this. It's your typical steamed bun with custard filling, but the egg yolk really takes it to another level - it adds a savory richness that brings balance to a typically one-note sugar sweet custard.Haw gow - shrimp dumplings in crystal wrapper - tasted fresh with appreciable chunks of shrimp inside and had a \"bouncy\" texture (it's a good thing!) Curry Squid/cuttlefish - I thought this was fantastic!! The flavor of curry sauce/broth was perfect - not too salty and full of curry flavor. The cuttlefish was cooked just right (ok, maybe a tad on the extra chewy side) but the flavor of the sauce made up for itGood:Xiao long bao - soup dumplings. Thicker skinned, but wonderfully rich with porky broth.Loh mai gai - rice wrapped in lotus leaves with mushrooms, pork, etc. Usually a solid dim sum item. Didn't disappoint here.Congee with preserved egg - Large bowl, so it was pretty filling. It had the right amount of seasoning and was a nice Chinese broccolli - gotta get some greens! Standard vegetable fare. It's nice that they serve the oyster sauce on the side instead of drizzling it over. The broccoli (gai lan) was actually naturally sweet so it was nice to eat it plain.Egg Tarts - yum! Rich and custardy with flaky crust. Okay:Tripe - I'm a bit particular on this dish. This one seemed a little overcooked in that the tripe had no crunch. A wee too soft. For 4 people, we ended up paying 15-20ish.

Like, bad for Chinatown standards. That's a bad sign right there.Usually I come on weekdays, but Friday night was obviously busier, so much so that we had to go to their upstairs dining room. Not a problem, a lot of Chinatown restaurants actually have that. We got up there and were seated promptly. There was a rowdy drunk group there which is something you can't really control, but someone for some reason gave them a microphone? That's just a bad idea.So as I've mentioned, here you get a dim sum style menu for ordering what you want in your pot. This time though, they seemed to always forget two or three things we marked down. My friend marked down for 5 rice servings and we got zero until we asked for it. My girlfriend marked down for noodle bundles each time we sent a menu in, AND she asked the waiter for it, and never got it.At one time, our menu had lamb checked off, and when the waiter brought our other food he said the lamb would take a few minutes. It never arrived.The last straw was at the end of the meal, when the waiter dropped off our check. We gathered our credit cards, talked to ourselves for a good 10-15 minutes, and he still didn't return. Eventually I got our check and was about to walk into the back room to find this guy when a woman from another table stood up and took our ticket - apparently it was staff dinner going on behind us.

How does this one stand out from all the other places? Quite a few things...First off, Premium Seafood charges $18.99 per person for the basic option and it includes the general items such as fatty beef, lamb, fish balls, beef balls, tofu, vegetable, noodles, fish filet, spam, shrimp, taro, mushrooms, sausages, etc. Why is it more than the average Chinatown price of $16.99? There are two items that are not usually included at other hot pot places, mussels and clams. \u00a0In addition, if you were in the mood for more seafood, you can choose the $29.99 selection which includes lobster and crab legs. But I believe you may only order each item once per person. We went with the standard option and ordered the divided pot with the spicy and non-spicy broth. The spicy broth was ideal by color but completely off in flavors. It was not even mildly spicy. Mind you, I am Cantonese and it is not in my genes to have a high tolerance. If I find it too mild, imagine what the northern Chinese would think. We were given a one-time use, pictured menu to circle our items. I certainly like the concept, but they did not give us a new menu each time we ordered a new round. Many items were forgotten. Most of the times, we would just tell them what we wanted instead of marking the menu. The serving portions per plate are very small and we constantly had to keep ordering. It will not be a problem as long as you do not find it a hassle. Some complaints with the items would be the lamb was too tough and the clams were puny. Service was not the best or worse. I think some coordination could be done. Barely half of the party had arrived and they kept bombarding us with repetitive questions such as, \"What broth would you like? Seafood or standard?\" Please slow down and allow us a minute to settle and to take a quick glimpse at the menu. Also, please show us a receipt and not just give us an amount to pay. With beverages, tip, and tax included, nine of us paid $27 each.

You order off an illustrated menu so it's easy to pick and choose.Afterwards, go and pick your dipping sauces!! They have a wide variety to choose from.

The fatty lamb was my favorite for sure.- Broth was refilled constantly by the service- Tons of utensils to help you grab your food, especially for those that prefer not to share hidden germsThe service here was great for a Chinese restaurant. Yes, it's no Michelin-starred joint, so I don't think it's fair to expect high end up cuisine with the price you pay.

Half way through the song this very rude girl ( who seemed to be friends with the man who greeted us) got up and would change our song, she would not let us finish. And I understand this is a mostly asian karaoke bar and maybe American music is not their thing, but we did pay to go there its not like we went there for free and taking turns to play songs would of have been the adult thing to do. The same man who greeted us and his group of friends said something to us when we would put on a song. We finally gave up on singing anything when the girl and two other guys decided to erase our playlist...Its shame because this place has potential but who wants to go to a place that makes you feel uncomfortable because you do not play their type of music? Everyone, please save your money, and DO NOT buy their groupon, it is the most unwelcoming place.

A soy marinated plate of sub-gum(can be seen in photos). This was your basic tongue, intestine type dish, which is difficult for some Westerners, but if you are open minded and love all textures then this dish is perfect over some steamed rice and with a bit of chili oil. I just really enjoy the cheap cuts of the animal, because when done right, they offer so much more flavor.2. A clay pot filled with Pigs Feet in \"special\" broth. Yea buddy, this dish was great if you love gelatinous type fare, almost exactly like chicken feet, just much more hearty and fatty. Me, I personally loved this dish as it was so fatty, and fat just means extra flavor. Once you can overcome your fear of this type of texture, then you will be left with so many more interesting options. This dish was especially flavorful in the \"special\" broth the feet were cooked in. I am not exactly sure what the broth was, but it was quite similar to a typical chinese brown sauce, a bit sweet, but also a tad garlicky. Really really good. 3. Now while I didn't order nor eat much of the BBQ Duck(the other dishes were huge), this was very good as well. The Duck itself had a nice char and a sweet and sugary glaze. And for only $4.95, the portion was huge, and plenty for one person to be completely satiated. All in all this place really left a good impression on me, and for that I cannot complain one bit.

Although the interior has changed now-and-then, the food has remained quite consistent for decades. While the dinning area usually remains relatively quiet, the front end BBQ take out portion always seems bustling at peak hours with people completing their visit to Chinatown with some delicious authentic Chinese BBQ meats to take home. Throughout the years, I have frequented BBQ King quite regularly despite the rise and fall of many different BBQ house places (including a few BBQ King franchises). I still think BBQ King is the most authentic version in Chinatown (and probably the Chicagoland area). Revisiting the dining experience (after years of neglecting it for takeout), gave me quite a surprise. Five of us ordered the Roasted Duck 3 ways (that comes with sallt and pepper shrimp) along with snow pea leaves and an order of BBQ Pork. BBQ Pork - this was gobbled up in a hurry by the 5 hungry patrons. The sweetness of the honey glaze along with the fattyness of pork really make this a classic. While some of the textures vary from piece to piece, overall the BBQ Pork maintains it's delicious flavor without being overly salty (unlike some places that usually sauce it with soy sauce). It's no wonder I always never leave BBQ King without at least a pound of BBQ Pork to take home to savor for days. Snow Pea Leaves in garlic sauce- it was executed adequately. About what you expect in the preparation of veggies in Chinatown. The leave maintained a good texture, while not being too oily or salty for consumption. Peking Duck - the bao is a bit underwhelming, but the value is quite great. A nice side of hoisen and chopped green onions, and you have pretty much the real thing. Is it slightly lacking in some areas? Sure. But for this value, it's pretty hard to beat. The duck meat is delicious (even if not the most authentic - usually there is very little meat and mostly skin in the bao), and is worth the trip. Duck stir fry - the gravy and saltiness made this the perfect rice accompaniment. Generous pieces of duck meat and veggies really made this one of my favorite offerings of the night. We basically licked the plate clean because of how great the gravy tasted with rice. Duck Bone Soup - it was brothy and salty. While you could taste the duck in the soup, it was for the most part just salty broth. It matched well to give balance to the meal, but it wasn't anything above average. Salt and Pepper Shrimp - seemed out of place for the meal and more of a throw in, but the value is appreciated. The shrimp was fried and seasoned enough to eat without removing the shell. But if you're squeamish to that, you could always take the time to remove the shell, revealing generously sized shrimps. The take out items really are what make BBQ King the place to visit. Here are my favorites. BBQ Pork - authentic and delicious. I usually order mine half fatty and half lean, which allows it to stay relatively tender even when taking it home and heating it back up. Roasted Pork - this is more for eating there, because of the beautifully crispy skin that you get with a cut of this deliciously tasty meat. This usually sells out first, so make sure to get in line quickly before it runs out. Usually doesn't really make it home prior to consumption, but when it does, it is best to throw in the oven or toaster oven to recreate that crispy skin. Princess Chicken - usually super tender, light and fragrant , it is a difficult dish to execute, and no one does it better in Chinatown. Roasted Duck - the staple and star of BBQ king, it's slightly high priced, but usually worth it. Overall, the dine in experience isn't going to blow you away, but it is quite a good deal. However, the thing that really makes this place go, is the takeout BBQ.

When we were there, there were only two guys singing really bad in Mandarin (or Cantonese, or Taiwanese)..for like ever. We decided to sit at the bar and order drinks. When asked how much the songs are for the stage and whatnot, they said FREE. What? Why get a room when you can sing for free? We soon found out why. The setup is nothing like I've ever seen. There is a stage, with 2 mics, 2 chairs and the karaoke screen for you. You select your songs on the side of the stage via a touch screen computer. It takes forever to select a song because there is almost no selection. Unless you know the entire Abba collection, you'll spend like 10 minutes trying to find one song that you remotely know. I did love that the videos that went with the songs were either the ACTUAL VIDEOS (!) or something completely relevant to the song..like if it was a disco song, there would be people dancing to disco and a disco ball, not a handicapped baby in a wheelchair.The drinks are pricey, and they only have one kind of sake, I'm assuming because it's Chinese, but we had a good time.

The staff is small (no this isn't a jab at their heritage) but they're very friendly and accommodating. I also like that they have both a public karaoke as well as private rooms, although every time I've visited it has been during the week and we were literally the only people there besides the staff. The potstickers, edamame and wings are pretty tasty. Many of the songs that AREN'T in Chinese are up-to-date, modern pop with the actual videos playing along. It's interesting that you can also have the song play the original if you're worried about singing off key or if you \"don't remember how it goes,\" it's really helpful. The sound is pretty decent, as well.So why three stars??? (In fact, I would have given two stars, but the staff is actually very nice and polite, so I didn't want to be too much of a nag with a 2-star).The main reason is that they actually have a $15 minimum purchase per person. This was never mentioned to us the first time I visited, since I think almost everyone in our party ordered food and drink. But the second time they mentioned it several times. Luckily, they were very nice and didn't really FORCE us to buy more, but they made it clear that next time (which there probably won't be one, in my case) they have to stand firm in their \"policy.\" The song selection is limited and doesn't seem to have any karaoke classics. It's ALL pop songs. And there is no KJ (karaoke DJ), the song rotation should be \"first-come-first-serve\" but it's really up to whoever's tooling around with the system. And it IS Chinatown karaoke, so sometimes you might get a mis-interpreted lyric up on the screen.The drinks and food are rather expensive, especially for the portion sizes. It's roughly $8-12 for appetizers; while they're delicious, it just seems to be a bit much to not have an actual meal.I don't drink alcohol, but I do enjoy their mixed juice. I think I threw them off guard when I asked for something sweet but non-alcoholic and had to instruct them to mix cranberry, orange and pineapple juice for a virgin mocktail. Again, the biggest problem with this place is that minimum purchase. I don't drink alcohol and if I just want to sing when I'm not in the mood to eat or spend $15 on appetizers, I shouldn't be subjected to a minimum order; especially when the place is DEAD, other people in my party are spending money and I'm tipping almost as much as my drink costs ($3 for a juice).For those of you who need to get that liquid courage before singing, or who are actually out to drink AND sing, this place is a great destination, and I would recommend it.For you die-hard karaoke crawlers who just want to sing (like me) and nurse your drink, probably not the place to go.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 6, 3]}, "35": {"description": "When the birthday boy says all he wants to do for his 30th birthday is sing...his wife set up the stage at this spot.

The latter issue was helped somewhat by the fact that there were pictures of many artists/groups as well as their names, but it was still a bit weird.

Lao Yunnan, or \"Old Yunnan\". Food from Yunnan Province could be categorized as Southwestern Chinese, which is characterized by ALL KINDS OF SPICY CHILI PEPPERS AND STRONGLY FLAVORED SPICES. The Southwestern provinces are located near Tibet, Burma, and India, and usually includes Sichuan (also spelled as Szechuan) food, Chongqing, Guizhou, Guangxi. Typical dishes include spicy hotpot, spicy stir-fried pork, spicy beef slices and tripe, spicy eggplant, spicy veggies, spicy tofu, spicy fish soup... etc. In Chicago's Chinatown, Lao Sze Chuan is the most famous place for spicy Sichuan/Szechuan food, but I feel like the spiciness has been lowered there. It's still good, but sometimes the dishes tend to veer towards sweet or sour: the typical flavor of Cantonese food. So within the Lao Franchise, Lao Yunnan, while less well known, can probably offer you something closer to an authentic Southwestern flavor. Not to be purist just for it's own sake, Lao Yunnan definitely offers many dishes that have a universal appeal. For a few famous dishes, try out any Hot Pot for a bubbly and tongue-scorching interesting experience in watching your own food cook on the table. Beef slices, whether hot or cold, are delicious. The stir-fried mushrooms are always a good choice, and you would be surprised at the variety of shrooms with their different chewy textures. Fried chicken-piece dishes are good since they add a lot of interesting spices. Any eggplant dish will be worth trying out. For a non-spicy alternative, the tea-brewed duck is a good choice. For something that might taste a bit weird at first but eventually grow, try anything from the cold appetizer bar at the counter, mostly consisting of pickled vegetables. The spicy fish soups are also good, if you are willing to pick through the fish bones and watch the head bob in the soup.I would have given the place 5 stars, but sometimes the service seems a bit off. The waitresses sometimes seem impatient at me for no reason.

Hmm, my friend and I looked over and saw that they had a pot of boiling hot tea. OkkaayyyThen we ordered chinese broccoli with garlic, flat noodles with chicken, and mushrooms with beef. About 15 minutes later, the server comes out and says that they are out of flat noodles. Noodles/rice are staples of Asian cuisine so I find it very puzzling to be told that they ran out.

Ma Pao Tofu---This dish was easily the BEST m.p.t I have ever had, not even close. What gave this dish it's uniqueness was the flavor of the sauce that everything seeps in. It wasn't spicy, but just really intense with a ton of flavor, way more than most dishes I have ever had. I wish I knew what they put in here, because it looks just like so many other MPT I have had, but it just wasn't. It wasn't just good, it was great.2. Nine Flavor Pork Stomach---This is your basic sub gum(intestine dish) that is served cold, and whoa buddy, packed with what seemed like 1000 different and interesting flavors. Even if you like Sub-Gum this would definitely be intense for someone whose palette is weak or immature. Me, I loved it. It was chewy, crunchy, and just packed with flavor. Really intense.3. Rice Noodle Soup---This dish is basic, and was necessary with all the other flavors going on. It included a simple chicken stock broth(i think), some cilantro, chicken, rice noodles, scallions, and toasted garlic. It is a basic version of our Caulky chicken noodle, just more flavorful. It was good and it definitely settled down my palette from the other two intense dishes.Finally, this place was inviting, with good service and fair value, and I will definitely be back at some point...Enjoy Suckas'!!!", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 12, 14]}, "4": {"description": "we came for the famous cross-bridge rice noodle, it is not as good as expected, i feel like the chongqing beef noodle we ordered is even betterbut one thing i do really like about this place is all the appetizers they have (in the cart by the cash register), espeically the spicy bamboo shootthe hotpots are pretty good too", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 10, 5]}, "6": {"description": "Here food tastes so so , expensive , I do not recommend here at all .

In this case, my fiance, my friend, and I decided to get piping hot noodles and flatbread made with authentic Xi'an cuisine. Xi'an Cuisine is a small restaurant, but we were quickly seated and given menus. The waiter explained that their food is made authentically and therefore may tak a while to come be served. We understood the predicament and placed orders for some of their hand-stretched noodles, pork and lamb flatbreads while catching up over tea and water. Given that my fiance came back from visiting Xi'an province to see the Terracotta Army in person, her feedback was of utmost importance. She was not as impressed with the noodles because they had a chewy consistency. She explained that most hand-pulled noodles made in house are usually very soft and \"easily slurpable.\" It was evident that the noodles were hand-pulled though because the noodles were of varying length. Maybe they were over or understreched? Anyhow, the flavors were there. The noodles were glistening with hot oil and served with generous amounts of crisp vegetables and soft, tender meat. But what impressed us the most was the lamb flatbread--seasoned to perfection with ground lamb sandwiched between oiled, pan-fried flatbread.

Most importantly tho, the soup base is just quietly amazing. Tho it does not have the type of flavor that will PUNCH you right in the face, it has this really subtle flavor that just keeps you wanting more. In alot of chinese restaurants I would always need a beverage to help clean my mouth to wash out the strong flavor but the noodles did not leave me wanting to do that which is great. As for the beef flatbread, the beef is alright I wouldve preferred it if it had some kind of sauce inside but the flatbread itself was killer. The inside was soft and the outside layer was crispy.

It was just what I expected it to be and more. The entire experience at Little Lamb was fabulous. From the moment we walked through the door to the moment before we received our check, just fabulous. On a super cold winter evening, hot pot hit the spot.Location - Little Lamb is strategically placed right on the corner of Wentworth. Right below a karaoke bar. You really would not realize this is a hotpot spot unless you decided to be a huge creeper and took a peek through the window. Even so, I love that this is not so intuitive as to turn into a tourist trap! Decor - modern glam serving ancient Chinese realness! I LOVE this decor! Easily the sleekest design in all of Chinatown! I love all of the black reflective glass on the tables, the red and white accents, and the huge paintong on the wall. I also LOVE the chandeliers. I felt so fancy eating here. Even the chopsticks are fancy! The booth seating are super comfy. I love the circular ones at the front!Service - Service here was decent. When the host sat us with our menus, it was like 5 minutes before our waiter came to see what we wanted to order. Slow down! I had no idea what was going on because It was my first hotpot experience but thankfully my good Asian friend was a seasoned hp diner, so we just let her take control of what we ordered. Our waiter was very nice. But we received no refills on our water. And we were not followed up with during our dinner. I was not too pressed about this because I dislike when wait staff hover, but not having water refilled whilst eating SPICY broth is not okay.Drinks - We all got wine. YES! For once I ordered a drink! BEWARE! The \"Chinese Wine\" is NOT wine!! It is 56% alcohol shot. The fragrance itself of the shot gave my friend a headache that she literally sent it back because she didn't want to be drunkboots-legsintheair drunk at Little Lamb. Food - Hotpot reminds me so much of Pho except you make the food fresh here at the table. You also have complete control over what you put into the pot. I like that you could control the temperature settings at the table. This is just a neat dining experience! All of the ingredients here are fresh! The chicken and pork slices were so thin. I would have loved them to be in chunks or dices (the chicken at least) but chicken is chicken. I also tried tripe for the first time and I was SO pleasantly surprised! Very rubbery, but the taste was quite nice. The potatoes were AMAZING once cooked in the broth! I accidentally mistook one for a big chunk of ginger. My friends thought my reaction to that bite was hilarious. I literally yelled \"ewwwwwwwwwwww\" and they were like, thats ginger. I felt so dumb but it was so funny afterwards. I also loved the beef balls in the broth. And the fried dough. Do yourself a favor and also add noodles! Everything was great.*Mongolian Meat Pie - basically like a potsticker excpet flat! It was beef not chicken. this was DELICIOUS! Definitely order these!Price - Okay. Because I let my friend take complete control over what we ordered, I was not keeping an eye on how much everything was. I had NO idea that this bill would have amounted to so much.

As for the starters, the egg rolls were solid, everything else was decent with the exception of the crab rangoons, this wasn't that good. As for entrees, first off, huge portions, in fact, this dinner for 3 easily would of fed 4 people, maybe even 5 or 6. As for the taste, only one mediocre one, the lemon chicken. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the lemon flavor tasted a bit like the inside of a lemon meringue pie, which everyone agreed was a bit too sweet. Then there was the fried rice, and shrimp and scallop dish, both very solid. Maybe a tad short of great, but very solid. The Kung Pao Beef on the other hand was great. A great deal of spicy hot, but not too much to make it difficult to eat (well maybe if you got overly involved with the red peppers and/or seeds). The freshness of this dish also popped, especially with the peanuts. I would not call it an exaggeration to call it far and away the best Kung Pao I've ever had. So all in all we were happy and overly full. We got a good meal at about $22 a person with tax and tip.................................. I want to add 2 things to this review. My girlfriend doesn't like to experiment with food decisions as much as I do. This review is incomplete because they have an entire menu of dishes I did not try one of. I would like to go back there after I research some more traditional Chinese dishes (the seafood ones looked especially interesting), and try them. I will also not order a set item like the dinner for 3 and pick and choose off both menus....................Finally I'd like to address the people who had problems with the service and only gave it one star. This place is quite a bit authentic, and I know we're in America, but there are some cultural differences that I believe play a factor. The rest of the world is not so obnoxious and demanding as Americans, maybe that's why they aren't as attentive. To me they were a bit aloof, but got the job done. I personally have never been to China, but have talked to many who have. Ask them what service is like in a common restaurant (not some high class place business people go to).

Guess what? THE SHRIMP WONTON IS RAW! Unbelievable. So they took it back and 20 minutes later came back with another bowl of shrimp wonton noodles. Guess what? IT WAS ALSO RAW! I cannot believe it! They were serving us raw food. Words can NOT explain how embarrassed I was taking my grandfather and uncle out to this restaurant. So what now? We decided to just change our order to beef noodle soup. Everyone else finished eating except my grandfather and uncle. So after another 15 minutes, they came back with 1 bowl. We waited another 20 minutes and the other bowl has not arrived yet. So we asked the waitress. They forgot it again! Unbelievable.. I never experienced such horrible customer service.

Most importantly, the best soup dumplings I've had since NYC (yes, I am aware there are better in Singapore and Taiwan).

I was even pissed, and wanted to leave, he then called 911 and asked me to stay. The manager even pushed my shoulder to stop me walking?! WTF! He yelled that I could not go anywhere without paying. OMFG, is it about the money, $20?! No sense of doing business, no care about the your consumer?! Well, so I called 911 also and waited , the polices came, and he even lied to the polices.

I have ate at almost every restaurant multiple times. When I first went to Hing Kee, I thought it was the best place at the moment. Decent prices, decent food. Now in my most recent visit, I received the WORST customer service in any restaurant that I have been. I went there on a Saturday afternoon with my family as a belated birthday lunch for my uncle. I ordered a plate of sushi and it was decent. My uncle and grandfather both ordered shrimp wonton noodles. When I was done with my sushi plate, their food still has not arrived, and it has been 30 minutes. The other table came after us got their food. What did the other table order? Shrimp wonton noodles. So I asked the waitress. They said that they forgot to put in the order. That's fine. People make mistakes. So we had to wait another 30 minutes to receive our first bowl of shrimp wonton noodles. Guess what? THE SHRIMP WONTON IS RAW! Unbelievable. So they took it back and 20 minutes later came back with another bowl of shrimp wonton noodles. Guess what? IT WAS ALSO RAW! I cannot believe it! They were serving us raw food. Words can NOT explain how embarrassed I was taking my grandfather and uncle out to this restaurant. So what now? We decided to just change our order to beef noodle soup. Everyone else finished eating except my grandfather and uncle. So after another 15 minutes, they came back with 1 bowl. We waited another 20 minutes and the other bowl has not arrived yet. So we asked the waitress. They forgot it again! Unbelievable.. I never experienced such horrible customer service.

Sounded quite warm and inviting so we checked it out. It was the Friday after Thanksgiving so only about half of the vendors were open (and several vacant storefronts too) so we obviously weren't hitting this spot on a high-traffic day. My wife was jonesin' for some pan-fried dumplings/potstickers and Grill-N-Chill was the only spot offering such goodness. Looked like a Mom and Son (or Grandson) operation. The wife ordered a strawberry bubble tea to round out her 'snack'. I was initially going to forego a mid-afternoon snack, but I spied an advertisement for a Spam, Fried Egg and Ramen noodle soup bowl for $3.99 with a free soda included. Too intriguing not to try. We paid and seated ourselves at a nearby table for 10-15 minutes while our food was prepared. The potstickers were lukewarm, but still pretty tasty. Served only with a couple packets of soy sauce when proper dumpling sauce would have made a huge difference in taste. The bubble tea was pretty good, but was advertised as 'fresh fruit'. We watched the guy prepare the beverage and he scooped a few strawberry pieces (in syrup?) into the mixture, but it was mostly powdered mix and tasted as such. My warm bowl of pan-fried egg and spammy goodness, however, was pretty great. If I worked in this neighborhood I think I'd often find myself here for breakfast and lunch during the cold winter months. This was simple comfort food and definitely hit the spot.So all in all a good cheap mid-afternoon meal.

I straighten/blow dry my hair about once or twice a month, never colored it, never teased it, etc. I was nervous to get my hair colored for the first time and found this place through yelp. I wanted to go to an Asian hair salon thinking they would know my hair better and what I was looking for. I asked to have color that was noticeable but not extreme. I also strongly feared the look of outgrown roots. We settled on all over that would be brushed into my roots so that when my hair grows, it wouldn't be as obvious. By the end of the session, she asked how I liked it. I was honest and said I didn't really see the difference. The color was still pretty dark. She said it would get lighter throughout the week and that I would notice it more later on. I appreciated the time she spent and the advice she gave. I read really great reviews online about her work as well so trusted her opinion. I tipped heavily ($24 on a $96 job) and left. I went to work, hung out with my friends, saw my sister, etc. and not a single person noticed that I had colored my hair. I tried laying out in the sun for a few days in hopes that it would make it lighter but that failed to work as well. I thought that I might just not have noticed the difference, but everyone I saw, even my roommate, didn't notice anything different. I returned to get my hair colored lighter - after all, if I was going to spend the money on coloring my hair, I wanted it to be noticeable. We agreed on highlights using some bleaching cream because allover would be too damaging for my hair. She said she would comb in the highlights into where the allover color was placed because if it was placed at my roots, it would produce a different color because it was my original hair. I trusted her opinion and thus underwent the new plan. I noticed a difference in service at this point. I was checked in on less frequently. 20 minutes of sitting led to 30 minutes. However I know she took care of me last time thus trusted her. After my hair was washed and dried, I was not pleased. The highlights were significantly lighter and as you can see from the picture. She even said that it came out lighter than expected. It looked like I hadn't gotten my roots touched up for 3 months. I asked about it and she reiterated that it came out according to plan. As you can see by the picture, I'm not sure who exactly would want to plan a 3 month missed root touch up look... I was extremely disappointed and upset. I asked what could be done and she reiterated that if she did highlights at the roots, it would look a different color. She said I could come in for a root touch up later but it looked like I needed one 3 months ago! I felt trapped and when I asked what she would do for the root touch up, if she had to color it with the original allover color then do highlights again, I got a confusing response. She had also quickly moved onto the next customer making it hard to express my concern. I was charged for the full amount of highlights and apprehensively tipped well again thinking I would have to come back again soon. I went home thinking I might be over exaggerating but my roommate and sister were very blunt with me and told me it looked really bad. Even when I had my hair up, you could see the harsh contrast of the 2 inches of original hair color and the highlights. I booked another appointment. I eventually decided that I could not risk it again and booked with another salon. I already felt that the years I've taken such great care of my hair was ruined. I called Bsquare and cancelled my appointment. An hour after cancelling the appointment at Bsquare, I got a call saying that if I came in, the procedure would be complimentary. I said thank you, was respectful, but decided that I could not risk it again. I had already spent over $190 on purely damaging my hair. I wish that the second procedure when I came in unpleased with my hair a week after the first procedure was complimentary especially since after the first allover I expressed that I didn't see a difference and she said to come back in and that we could do highlights if I wasn't pleased. I also wish at the end of my second procedure, she expressed more concern for my horrification of my hair. She too acknowledged that it was lighter than expected. I felt so trapped. Luckily the new salon was able to quickly and easily fix my hair in a manner the stylist at Bsquare didn't mention.

I usually just make my way to Chinatown and tell them I'm walking in for a haircut. I have never waited more than 5 minutes yet. They'll give you a locker to put your belongings and here comes the best part...THE HAIR WASH! They give the nicest scalp massage/wash I have ever received in my life. It makes me want to fall asleep sometimes but I just sit there, close my eyes, and soak in the therapeutic feelings.Afterwards, they let me to the salon chair and I was assigned a hair stylist. I'm not Chinese so it almost seemed like we had a language barrier going on but I did bring some photos and a list of what I wanted done on my hair. This helped make the entire haircut experience more reliable and promising. I have never been disappointed with the haircuts I've received from B Square.I usually pay with cash, which comes along with a 10% discount. I am always paying between ~$29-$35 and this includes the tip. In my opinion, I think this is a pretty good deal.

I was extremely satisfied with the look and the price. However, I went for the second time in December, a few days before Christmas, and I wasn't satisfied at all. I specifically booked Kit again because he did wonders on my hair last time. I wanted him to dye my hair lighter than the color I had before and give my hair a small trim. When I book someone to help me get my hair done, I expect that person to do everything for my hair and not just pass the work on to someone else later. Kit just trimmed my hair then let another person dyed it. When everything was done, my hair came out to be super dark, darker than before I came in. I wanted to lighten my hair. Not make it even more darker than it already was. So I thought, maybe I'll give it a few weeks to let the color fade, but it only faded a little and I really hair dark hair on me. I like light brown hair. Aside from that, I thought the price would be cheap since last time I only paid 68 dollars for a trim and a color, but I was shocked when my bill turned up to be over 115 dollars without the 10% discount. I can't believe they charged me around 30-40 bucks for a 1 inch trim. I tipped generously, even though I wasn't satisfied with it. And because two people did my hair, I had to give tips to both of them which brings it to about more than 135 dollars for the finished look. I also paid for my sister's color and trim too. Her overall finish was more than my overall look. I had to go to the bank to get more cash because i thought it'll be like 68 dollars for one person. In total I spent around 250 bucks and coming from a poor, college student, it isn't worth it. Anyways, I'll just go back to my friend who also does a good job and charges less.

We ordered the kung pao chicken, sweet and sour soup, wonton soup, some sort of boiled beef in spicy broth, dry chili beef, Hunan pork belly, and another beef dish which I can't remember but was also good. There wasn't a single bad thing we ordered. They laid out kimchi, peanuts, pickled vegetables, a hot horseradish mustard and sweet and sour sauce for dipping and adding to our dishes. Also ordered crab rangoon appetizer because yes, this is an authentic Chinese restaurant, but who doesn't love crab rangoons?Wait staff was very friendly, we did not have to wait for a table, and the food was very good.

Portion sizes are ridiculously large so we ended up with dinner part deux/breakfast. The mother complained that both the pork and beef dishes were overly sweet with too much sauce and without enough crispiness.

She did commend the string beans being made very well.Service was superb - our tea was topped off twice and the waiter asked us three times if we were 'okay' and if we needed more rice.

She is really the traditional tiger mom in every sense and has strong opinions about food - so really this review was written on her behalf (I guess I am ghost writing?).From my perspective, an ABC (American Born Chinese), the food was great if not a little too sweet. We got three plates between the two of us - the salt/pepper string beans, the sweet and sour pork, and beef with satay sauce. Portion sizes are ridiculously large so we ended up with dinner part deux/breakfast. The mother complained that both the pork and beef dishes were overly sweet with too much sauce and without enough crispiness. It seemed like they were grilled ahead of time and sauced when ordered - which is a big no-no for those with discerning taste. She did commend the string beans being made very well.Service was superb - our tea was topped off twice and the waiter asked us three times if we were 'okay' and if we needed more rice. This was by the the busiest restaurant in Chinatown that evening but they were well staffed (perhaps overly so) for the guests. Food was served immensely quick as well (leading to our speculation that some was pre-made).From my mother's perspective it was probably a 3-star meal but I really must commend the service that was always courteous and always efficient.

AS I SAID BEFORE, on the back of the shelf, behind the ordinary novelty items sat....THE GREATEST ITEM IN ALL OF CHICAGO'S CHINATOWN, a porcelain Collie dog in a pimp outift. Yes, This collie (THE GREATEST ITEM IN ALL OF CHICAGO'S CHINATOWN) is equipped with not only a hat with a feather, but a matching red vest, and is looking his best while he fulfills the needs of other Collies. This AMAZING find was one of a kind, and it is OURS. YES, I repeat THE GREATEST ITEM IN ALL OF CHICAGO'S CHINATOWN IS OURS.Maybe the Pimp collie is on reorder, another barge will be sent across the Pacific, loaded onto a train in Oakland and then shipped to a distributor nearby Pacific Furniture and will thus be soon available for purchase.

You look around to see if anyone else is eying it but they are all upfront looking at the cheap souvenir imports. You feign disinterest when the shop owner comes over and starts the sales pitch. But you know that in the end you must have it. And so you do. I wish there was a secret way to get into this store so I only had to look at things that were of some value and not all the \"junk\" in the front. Ahh . . .a girl can wish.

I personally really love their beef broth! The shabu shabu is enough for two people. Their beef quality is okay, a little fatty and comes with an array of fish balls and veggies (cabbage, spinach, Chinese lettuce, enoki mushroom, one carrot, one radish, one corn, glass noodles, and tofu) sometimes the veggies are just not fresh! The tray of sauces are amazing. Sometimes, they are out of some of their sauces and they replace it with other ones. I've also had their shaved ice. I don't recommend it.

They bring out a pot of beef broth on a burner for you and you throw in your raw ingredients. You're pretty much cooking your own meal. It was fun in my opinion and the broth had good flavor. For me, I used the broth as more of a flavoring tool for my vegetables and meat. I didn't really drink the soup because I noticed oil on the top. I knew I would feel really heavy afterwards if I were to drink it. The experience was very casual but I haven't been to a lot of hot pot restaurants, so it's nice to know I found one nearby my apartment.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 2, 16]}, "47": {"description": "This place by far is my favorite restaurant of all time. I took my husband out for dinner here (first time I ever bought a guy dinner!) for our first date ever and we got married... So I guess it worked!!Shabu shabu here is beyond amazing. I highly recommend the Kobe beef shabu shabu (it's not actually Kobe beef if you know much about Kobe beef and usda stuff but it's still very very marbled and tender beef!) For the set I believe it is about $22, and my husband always orders a la carte salmon and I order extra enoki and potato noodles. The plate you order comes out with raw ingredients, and a boiling hot pot of broth to cook it all in over a portable stove top. You also get a tray of sauces which my husband and I often add to the broth before we add the ingredients to taste. We also bogart 2 of the sauces for dipping everything we cook in (he likes the peanut sauce and I like the satay [aka BBQ] sauce.) Cooking food together is really fun and romantic but don't come here hoping for a private booth and quiet area to have a nice date. The restaurant is very \"open\" in design and has a very modern feel to it. There's even a koi pond under the floor so you can watch the fish swim around beneath you! Really charming! So this isn't a place for a quiet romantic date, but a fun and engaging one. If you go with friends in a large group it's always a blast. You always try to pair up with someone because the shabu shabu sets serve 2 normally. Almost everyone I have brought here has left singing praises about the food and the atmosphere and it's a great place for lively conversation and merriment-- even with just bubble tea and no alcohol. I'm not sure if they even serve alcohol (they probably do) but the awesome drink selections of bubble tea are way more enticing than alcohol. My personal favorite is the kiwi sprite, it's a very simple drink but I never thought kiwi and sprite would make such a perfect combo. I don't know if they use some sort of sweetening syrup for their kiwis (a lot of bubble tea places do) but I have tried to recreate the drink at home to no avail. It's worth the price and having it as a treat with dinner is great. There are hundreds of drinks and smoothies and I'm pretty sure if you can think of it, it's listed on the menu. As far as the dishes they serve outside of shabu shabu, I have had limited experience with their sushi and not much else. The sushi a couple years ago was to die for, but last year I tried some and it was made completely different from the one I ordered a year prior and I wasn't really impressed. I think they may have gotten yet another sushi chef though since then so maybe the quality has improved again? But if you are going to a shop labeled \"shabu shabu\" on the front why would you get anything but that?My friends have had some noodle dishes from here before and said they were good but always kinda wistfully watched everyone else cooking their own food. It's all personal taste but the shabu shabu and drinks really are the headlining stars of this place. Never had a bad experience food wise, and the service has never been an issue for me but I am also not afraid to flag down waitresses when I need something. Every now and then there will be a communication error but they always have resolved it and have never been rude to me. However if you don't tip (I've had friends who don't and it is a shame to me) the service will pick up on it and if you come back they seem to just \"know\". I always have tipped well because I never had anything but great service so your mileage may vary. In summary... This is my favorite place in the world. Fun, friendly (if you can be friendly back), and DELICIOUS.

To start off with the good factors, I went earlier in the morning when they weren't too busy so I was able to experience a meal with excellent food temperatures and receive excellent service. The seating was pretty comfortable with a nice modern decor (although, the mix of colors and furniture choices prevent it from getting marks for decor from me). The hours are surprisingly long with a huge menu.Now for the not so positive aspects -- Much of the food did have good textures but was pretty bland overall. There were some that were done comparably well to some of the best dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, however there was also a lot of inconsistency in the quality between dishes and nothing really felt very premium about any of the dishes (although the price was pretty low overall).None of the dishes were particularly memorable for me. They didn't have the flavor complexity or texture variety that would've made them really stand out but several dishes were executed a bit better than others:Baked egg custard bun -- Very nicely prepared dough and aromatic custard.Beef & Cilantro rice roll - great texture on the rice roll (nice and elastic, slightly chewy)Stuffed eggplant - Very tender eggplant, nice flavor with the shrimp fillingCongee with beef - Does need a bit of salt and maybe pepper (and even some soy sauce), but the texture of the congee itself is very good and the beef is tender (which goes well with the small bits of ginger).Zhong Shan Style dumplings - what really stands out here is the skin which is a bit thicker than what you'd typically find on a dumpling but is actually surprisingly soft and chewy.Creamy egg yolk ball -- Could really use more egg yolk but this is fried very nicely and contains sweet glutinous rice that is very soft and chewySteamed pork patty /w preserved vegetable - done better than a lot of other restaurants in Chinatown since the pork is a bit more fatty but also slightly on the salty side.Overall, although there are several dishes that were enjoyable -- they were really better executed versions of the common food you'd find in Chinatown. There were also items such as the fish roe steamed dumpling and steamed beef ball that were below average. With this considered, China Cafe is a restaurant capable of breaking away from the pack to get 4 or 5 stars, but mixing some very nice elements of food and decor with poor ones really limit it from scoring any higher, even with the lower prices considered.With a few tweaks though, this restaurant could really change its identity and build a strong brand based on quality. First, renovate the restaurant to be consistent with the attractive modern look everywhere (it's like 60% there).

With four dishes, the meal ended at roughly $14 for four dishes (tips included). If you just want a quick fix of dim sum without waiting much this place will do the job.

For starters, we called in advance to reserve space for about 14-16 people (yes, I know, large), yet when they arrived, they were totally surprised by how many people were there. They ended up seating us at two of the tables that were quite large but too small for the number of people there. Luckily we were all either friends or from the same university so we just took it as an opportunity to get close to one another. When it was time to order, the waiters were extremely slow to come to us. It took us about an hour until we had water and food at the tables, and it took about an hour and half (from when we entered) until we had enough cups for tea at the tables. I'm not an expert in languages but I can tell you that the waiters responded only to those at my table who spoke Cantonese or Mandarin. I asked for water in English and they stared at me. The food was typical hot pot food but the broth the food was cooked in wasn't anything special. The spicy was way too mild for my taste and the mild was basically water. I made my food taste amazing with the garlic paste. One thing that truly annoyed us was the fact that even though we called and were told that they have a menu besides hot pot, there actually isn't. This place only does hot pot. Which is great if you want to try hot pot because they make it easy to order options, but if you have vegetarians at the table, it makes it impossible. We were all just so confused why they lied and said they had entrees on the menu when they don't. So just be aware of the fact that this restaurant only does hot pot.

For starters, we called in advance to reserve space for about 14-16 people (yes, I know, large), yet when they arrived, they were totally surprised by how many people were there. They ended up seating us at two of the tables that were quite large but too small for the number of people there. Luckily we were all either friends or from the same university so we just took it as an opportunity to get close to one another. When it was time to order, the waiters were extremely slow to come to us. It took us about an hour until we had water and food at the tables, and it took about an hour and half (from when we entered) until we had enough cups for tea at the tables. I'm not an expert in languages but I can tell you that the waiters responded only to those at my table who spoke Cantonese or Mandarin. I asked for water in English and they stared at me. The food was typical hot pot food but the broth the food was cooked in wasn't anything special. The spicy was way too mild for my taste and the mild was basically water. I made my food taste amazing with the garlic paste. One thing that truly annoyed us was the fact that even though we called and were told that they have a menu besides hot pot, there actually isn't. This place only does hot pot. Which is great if you want to try hot pot because they make it easy to order options, but if you have vegetarians at the table, it makes it impossible. We were all just so confused why they lied and said they had entrees on the menu when they don't. So just be aware of the fact that this restaurant only does hot pot.

They also have add-ons for an additional price to the AYCE menu. The food is amazing, especially with the spicy broth. I love spicy, and this was perfect. It was a little too hot once you eat about half a bowl, but too spicy in a GOOD way. Plus, Mandarin people generally eat very spicy, so it was expected. I would give Mandarin Kitchen 5* for the food. It is awesome and fresh and yummmmmy! But, based on both of my experiences, the service is worse than gritty fake watery soft serve ice cream. -3* for service...and i'm very generous to give 2*. The waitresses appeared to be very snobbish and unattentive. They walked right past me and ignored my attempts to refill for water or to even pay the bill! I usually see them huddle and chat in the corner by the kitchen entrance and they are very hesitant to come and assist you with you orders (literally takes them a minute to finish their chit chat and slowly zombie-walk over here). They also seem hesitant and unhappy with you reordering large quantities or more than two times. My friends and I can eat a LOT and we LOVE their sweet potato pancakes and xiaolongbaos/Shanghai dumplings, so we ordered 6 orders of each (1 order for each of us, not that much. an order had about 5 dumplings if I remember correctly). When we finally received our food, we were confused. There, on one plate, were 5 dumplings. We asked the waiter where the rest of our order is, and he said that he thought we wanted 6 INDIVIDUAL pieces, when the menu CLEARLY states that 1 order had 5 (?) dumplings. We just let it go and asked him very nicely for the rest, but he never came back with the food. He also commented before that we ordered 2 times already, and in return, we said, yes we eat a lot... and he just laughed it off and left with our third round of ordering. \u00a0It's safe to say that service is not one of Mandarin Kitchen's best qualities, but the food is very nice and fresh. Another thing that was a big turn-off is how they clean their tables. They use a suspicious spray and mist the whole table. If you are located within three table distances away, you are bound to cough or maybe die a little from the weird dishwashing disinfectant smell. Totally ruins the food in front of you. Bathrooms aren't as bad as some reviews make it look. They are exactly the same \"style\" as restaurant bathrooms in NYC, with bathrooms downstairs and the actual restaurant on the main floor.

Second, low quality meat. We had beef and chicken. The chicken tasted nothing like chicken and looked nothing like chicken. The beef was more like cheap gross bacon. Third, after the heat was turned down and the broth was no longer boiling, the spicy soup developed an oily layer on top and it was too oily for the soup for me.

My tongue was numb and my husband got a headache the rest of the night. It was too much MSG.

The noodles were hearty, withstood the meaty soup very well. Good pairing. I got the house special beef combo soup- meaty flavorful broth with tender beef pieces, beef tendon and tripe. Everything was well cooked and fall off the bone tender. I am wary of tripe in most restaurants because they normally still smell bad after being cleaned. Here though, it was cleaned and cooked well. I couldn't smell anything weird. Loved it!! Their spicy chicken noodle soup was great as well. The presentation of the soup as well as the taste was great. Their chive and pork dumplings took the longest to come out. They were a little on the pricey side $5.95 for 6 pieces but it was well worth it. They were made fresh and you could taste it. The kitchen looked busy with delivery order and in store customers but they still got our food out quickly.Service: I know Chinatown pretty well. I go there all the time. A lot of places have cringeworthy wait service. Here, it was completely different. Awesome service. Some of the best service I have come across. The waitresses knew enough English to communicate.

The hot chili sauce on the side I found to actually be spicy (which was rare for me). My dad's lamb noodle was rustic in that they roughly chop the lamb and keep the bones and fat in there (which some may like but he did not). Service was good in the beginning. The guy explained the menu to us as this was our first time there and our teas were constantly refilled. However, he later asked my dad to move around to the other side of the table so the people next to us could all be seated accordingly, as they were somewhat blocking the door and aisle. The waiter was sincere about it but they really should rethink their seating area arrangements, as the place itself is on the small side. Also, it took a long time for someone to come by and give us our check. When they finally did, they did not acknowledge that we probably would want a box for the extra noodles left, so we had to ask them again the next time around.What is supposed to be a quick and simple noodle place turned out to be not so much, especially as they are well-staffed with about 4-5 waiters/waitresses.Next time, I had the spicy dan-dan (dried) noodles that came with ground beef on top and a side soup. My sister had the pan-fried veggie noodles as their broth for the veggie noodle soup is not veggie (i.e. this place is not veggie friendly). I was already annoyed as once we were seated, we waited awhile for them to give us our menus and water/tea. I looked around and saw two of the waitresses just talking while cleaning up one table together, which was completely unnecessary. A waitress finally came to us with the menus and apologized for basically forgetting that we were there. Again, they are well staffed considering the size of the place so their service just sucks. With Chinese places, service usually is not their cup of tea, in terms of friendliness. This place had it reversed, friendly but efficiency and speed were very much lacking in this place. The noodles itself were good and very fresh tasting. However, instead of the dish being spicy, it was rather salty. I added the chili oil from the table and this time, it was rather mild and not spicy. My sister thought her veggie noodles were pretty tasty, but to note, they used cheaper veggies (celery) rather than veggies like mushroom and bok choy.Overall, noodles itself are pretty good but not out of this world and portions and prices are decent.

The stuff included in the lower version still contains about 18-20 different stuff. I went for the upgraded version though I was looking forward to sample the seafood.2. Deco: 3/5 not a spot for a romantic date. More of a family place. Plays loud Korean music (which isnt bad at all if its your kinda thing). Nothing in particular about the shop really caught my eye. Noisy due to the many families eating around you.3. Portions: 4/5 HUGE portions. The upgraded seafood version we ordered was honestly too much for 2 people to finish (had a small hillock of shells gathered by the time we finished). I never got down to sample the other stuff on the plate simply because there was so much crab/lobster on the plate.4. Quality: 3.5/5I would say the soup (ordered spicy and Chinese herbal) was at par with other shops. Minus points for not offering a single pot with 2 different soups. Instead they offer 2 pots - 1 per person.5. Service: 3.5/5Soup pots were refilled promptly. However the server seemed confused when I asked for an extra plate until my gf spoke to her in mandarin.

The waiting area is very small and cramped so a lot of people stood outside the restaurant after grabbing a number. The beef hand-pulled noodle had the darkest and most flavorful broth. But the broth was also the saltiest and most likely, MSG-influenced. This was evident as I was parched shortly after leaving the restaurant. The beef was also a bit tough. The lamb hand-pulled noodle had a lighter broth. Half of the lamb was fat. Great if you like that extra, buttery texture with your meat. Otherwise, proceed with care. The vegetable hand-pulled noodle had the lightest broth. It's basically the same as the other two noodles minus the meat. It came with picked vegetable, cilantro, snow pea, Chinese cabbage, carrots, and celery. Overall, the noodles had a nice texture but lacked elasticity. The noodle master makes the noodles fresh but the supply ran low with a house full of hungry patrons. He might have made the batches in haste to free up the back orders. The bowls were huge but it was also mostly broth with very little noodles. There are approximately 10 people working in this tiny restaurant: four in the kitchen and six out in the field.

No more $20 option (which already included the fish and shrimp). With tax and tip, it's almost 40 per person for mediocre seafood,most of which are pre-cooked and frozen. Their best items are actually fish and shrimp, unfortunately, so you can pay $15 more for the option of having crappy seafood alongside it! I personally don't go to hot pot to eat 50 plates of precooked king crab leg. I go for endless variety and \u00a0dipping sauces - \u00a0which they have, but so does everywhere else without the shitty seafood surcharge. The one thing that does set them apart is that you can have your own individual shabu shabu style pot or a big one (up to 2 broths in a divided pot) for everyone to share. I like big communal broths so that doesn't really make any difference to me. I think a la carte is by far the better option here if you must eat here...
