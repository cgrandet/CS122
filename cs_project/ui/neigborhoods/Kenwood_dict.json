{"the-original-pancake-house-chicago": {"comments": {"58": {"description": "This place is definitely worth the wait, and there definitely will be a wait.The Original Pancake House, located on E 47th in the heart of Hyde Park, offers the ultimate brunch experience.By the ultimate brunch experience, I mean that it excels in all aspects of brunch. Starting with the house brewed coffee and fresh cream, you will surely get your caffeine fix in for the day. The coffee is fresh and aromatic, strong enough to wake you up, but not too strong as to overwhelm its flavor.From the coffee, we moved on to our breakfast entrees. My friend got the meat lovers skillet while I got the bacon and eggs. The meat lovers skillet looked delicious, with generous pieces of meat laid over oven-baked potatoes. My bacon and eggs was perfect for what I was looking for. The eggs were pretty standard, but those bacon...The bacon I had was the best bacon I've ever had, bar none. Cured to perfection, with a delicate ratio of smokiness to crispy sweetness. The bacon was crisp and thick, delivering substance with flavor. Honestly, you just have to get it.Our meals also came with either 3 buttermilk pancakes or toast. We opted for the pancakes, which were light, fluffy and filling. Finally, we also got an order of their apple pancake, which was their house specialty. I'm usually not a big fan of apple based desserts, but absolutely loved the apple pancake. Sprinkled with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar, the melted sugar flowed into every crevice of the pancake. The apples were fresh and warm, with enough tartness to counterbalance the overload of sugar. The pancake was even softer and lighter than our buttermilk pancakes, almost melting the moment it enters your mouth. If I could imagine what clouds tasted like, it would be that.On top of everything (though, the food is by far the best part), the service was attentive and the prices were extremely fair. I highly, highly recommend making the trip down here for this great brunch experience.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 7]}, "56": {"description": "The food never fails me, and I've been trying something different every single time!

From the time I sit down, to the time I get my food and eat, this takes no more than 30 minutes every time whether I'm by myself or with 4-5 people. Beware of weekend mornings bc it gets extremely packed. I knocked them one star bc they need a larger waiting area (especially on weekends when it gets packed in there). They recently moved to a new and larger location, so no reason why the waiting area should still be the same size as their old location. They also need a new process for their waiting list.

The salted caramel cake, I do believe, may have come from a bakery. It reminded me of the dobo cake I've had at Julius Meinl.I shall have to return again to sample some other menu items.

A tip to the chef, please add some fresh garlic, yellow and green onion, red and yellow bell pepper along with some well cooked rice to your salmon for your salmon cakes; also add a touch of dijon mustard or mustard seed with some cayenne pepper, black pepper and a pinch of sea salt; mix together thoroughly (until rice is not noticeable) w/a beaten egg and then make your patties to cook.

They will make it whenever and get it to you whenever and in whatever shape it is in is ON YOU. The customer service people on the phones are rude, short, and don't give a damn about you or your order.

The food is extremely greasy, and sure, I like a good slice but the amount of grease in one square, thin crust slice should be illegal. What is happening here?

Lots of negativity. Yes, you do put your cash in a little metal tray installed in the bullet proof glass, reminds me of Harold's Chicken or Lem's.

It's quite good, in relative terms - i.e., given its location, Hyde Park, and thus its meager competition.Each crab rangoon was over-stuffed with cheese-crab filling - a problem I wish I had more often.The General Tao's chicken was hot and crisp, with fresh red and green peppers, and sauce with character (unlike the mystery goop at Nicky's). To repeat, all of my praise is to be understood in relative terms.The Singapore Vermicelli was amazing, but I don't have anything with which to compare it, which is a shame because it was even better than the Gen Tao's. On the other hand, if you've ever experimented with a noodle stir fry and curry powder, the dish will ring familiar, which makes it disappointing to some.The delivery was super fast.After several orders, it is worth noting that the dishes are hit and miss. The mango beef is very good, as is the black pepper beef. My roommates love the dumplings. The watermelon smoothie is delicious.Yet, the garlic lovers dish is mediocre (despite fresh ingredients and real garlic, which I usually love), and most of what comes in the 2-person combo special is hard to eat. The eggrolls have a strange chalky taste, and, despite tasting okay, the spare ribs have a funny smell which indicates that they have been frozen for too long. The strawberry chicken is a failure.

The crab rangoons were not as crispy (could've been due to the delivery, though), and they were way too full of a creamy substance. I intentionally say creamy substance because it was unlike any cream cheese I've ever seen (very slimy and barely any crab). The sweet and sour chicken was very dry and looked/tasted like it was old. The soup was pretty good, some of the fried noodles were stale, though. The egg roll was perfectly fried, but the inside was filled with some unidentifiable substance...definitely wasn't chicken and/or vegetables (although, I did detect some cabbage). The shrimp fried rice was probably the best thing I ordered, I actually finished all of it and they gave me a pretty large amount even though it was part of the lunch special.

I am not a huge fan of turkey burgers. I have to have a taste for something different to want one. I received one of their flyers in the mail for the Butter Crusted Turkey Burger, fries and a fountain drink for $5.99. I believe this is also a special they have during the week for lunch. Anyway, I needed to use the coupon before it expired. So, hungover and hungry, I went today to order. I had been previously and had ordered the deep fried turkey wing and that was just okay. I was too overwhelmed by the seasoning on the wing. I took my food home and was told by my neighbor, who was passing down the stairs, that my food smelled incredibly good. At this point, I was excited because I was thinking if she could smell it, it had to be good. I unwrapped my burger, which was neatly prepared with the perfect amount of condiments and veggies, to see that this patty was thick. I usually get nervous with thick patties because the meat is too much for me but I took a bite of this burger and my entire schema of life was changed! The toppings stayed on top of the patty. This WHEAT bun was amazingly delicious. This turkey patty was seasoned by the gods. I felt a tear well in my eye when I got down to the last two bites. I took one bite and finished off the fries, which they give you plenty, and stared at that final bite. I didn't want to see it go but alas, I indulged in that last bit of turkey burger greatness.

If you were wise, you would be in your car -- right now -- headed to 43rd and Cottage Grove and getting a serious turkey burger on. This may have been one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had.First off, the drive to JT is lovely. For me, I hop on LSD South and cruise on by the lake until I get to Oakwood. It's a simple drive, but it's really beautiful. Lake Shore Opens up south of I-55 and traffic (usually) eases up. On a clear day, you feel like it's just you, the road and the water. It's a bootleg version of the PCH. Once you get off LSD (heh), take a look around. Yes, these big houses, parks and boulevards you see are not an optical illusion. Kenwood is the real deal. I think some famous guy who lives in DC calls it home. Or, something. Head south and you're at your destination.Don't expect valets, earpieces or sports coats. Park your car (in the lot!), walk your happy self in and look around. When I was there, the dining room was pretty empty. It's just a few tables, big windows and a mounted tv that was airing \"The Game\" (sister, siiistah). I'm telling you all of this, so a.) you get a feel for the experience and b.) you know to focus on the food.I rarely eat beef. Thanks to that, I miss ham/cheeseburgers. You don't know what you've got til it's gone. Truly. I've had turkey/veggie/etc. burgers, but they aren't the same. But here, realizing the entire menu is turkey products, I started to hope that this may be different. It was. I ordered a double turkey burger with cheese, fried onions, tomato, lettuce, and pickle on a butter bun. Before you judge me, realize that, at times, I eat once every 20 hours or so. I needed this. Oh, and fries covered in MILD sauce. That's right: the best part of Harold's (mild sauce) was about to be all mine -- but with a burger. It took a while for my food to be ready and, initially, I caught an attitude about it. I reigned it in when I realized a.) made to order (no mayo) and b.) this was the real deal. When my to-go order was ready, I thought I was smuggling a baby hippo. This bag was HEAVY. Good sign. I raced home, tore out the fries, did a couple of curls with my burger, cracked open a beer and dug in..........................That was a moment of silence. This. THIS! This was a burger! With every bite, I was reminded of what eating red meat tasted and felt like. It was heavenly. The cheese was melted around all of the protein, the bun was thick and crispy.

Because there aren't too many places like Taday in this part of Bronzeville, I had previously been braving the parking horrors in Hyde Park, the South Loop or even up north to get my nails done. Since this place is 5 blocks from my house, I no longer have to!The Bronzeville area is going through a vigorous revitalization. New businesses, buildings, condos and beautiful park areas are popping up everywhere. While I was in the salon, I had a great conversation with a gentleman about Bronzeville being the new up and coming area and how amazing it is to see all the change happening around the neighborhood. Taday Nails is definitely a testament to this continued change.First, the salon looks completely new inside, and the decor is really cute and spacious. There are 9 pedi stations and 9 mani stations, which is great because there are lots of spaces for everyone in the salon. I walked in about 15 minutes after opening and stated that I needed a pedicure. I was told to go pick a color and immediately seated at a pedicure station (they have an abundance of great nail colors, by the way). And let me tell you: the lady who did my pedi went to WORK. It had been about 3 weeks since I had a pedi, and as I'm sure you know, with walking around all summer in sandals, your feet can get rough. She got my nails, heels and the bottom of my feet baby smooth. The polish application was flawless. My feet look great!Finally, the prices here are awesome. $20 for a pedi, $30 for a mani/pedi and $12 for a mani. However, if you pay cash, they knock $2 off the price, so I ended up paying only $18 for my pedi. I posted a pic of their price menu so others can see what else they offer and what the cost is. Of course, they also do gel and acrylic, etc. I can't wait to come back for a mani and pedi and eventually a no-chip manicure.If you live in Bronzeville or the surrounding area and are looking for a great place to get your nails done, this place is it. Great addition to the neighborhood!UPDATE 6/5/15: Just so you guys know, they no longer do a cash discount on services; instead, if you pay cash, they will give you raffle tickets...I guess if you come here enough that would be something nice, but basically I can now just skip the trip to the ATM.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 7, 18]}, "48": {"description": "This place is nice the Employees are nice.Twan the owner is so professional.I was going to 49th cottage no more since I found this nail spa.I am a regular now .I have had my nails and feet done multiple times.When I come to a salon I want quiet.I wish they had a sign that saids no kids.And tell clients texting only.I was there when a crying child reeked havoc in the salon.Also I don't want to hear other clients phone conversation while I am trying to relax.Also during the week like Tuesday or Wednesday are quieter times.If I go on Sat or fri I \u00a0sit in my car till they open at 10am.So at least I will be number 2 or 3 .Yes other people are also waiting to get serviced.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 12, 27]}, "44": {"description": "I was looking for a place that can become my regular salon since I've moved and hadn't found one.

HORRIBLE!I've come to this shop for 2 years. After this review, I will never support this business ever in life, nor should you. First, my nails are damaged. The technicians which I'm comfortable with weren't there, I went to another technician. This was a bad choice. After requesting my services, agreeing on a fee, paying the fee, and getting my nails completed I was very dissatisfied. While letting my hands and feet dry, I called other nail shops to take care of me. I'd waisted my money, I didn't bother complaining, I took a gamble going to a tech I didn't know and the turn out was, gummy polish and a mess on my hands. Just Horrible. This is NOT what lead to this review. What happened next is why I'll never refer, recommend,or review this shop highly. After booking an appointment at a streeterville nail shop, which was costly, but did better more professional work, I'd \u00a0gracefully gathered my belongings and preceded to leave. The owner from his front seat location, whom had waited for my nails to dry, didn't inquire about my services, bolted out, \"you owe $5 dollars\", I was leaving with a another customer I'd meet there, and wasn't sure he was speaking to me, being, I'd paid my money. They'd taken the card and completed the horrible services. I then replied, with a smile and calmly, \"no, I paid in full\" After what was already a horrible experience, and still needing to get to another shop for nails, plus eye brows, I ended up wasting my time recapping my visit and being falsely accused of owing $5!! I felt humiliated, my entire day was disturbed. These 2 men and a women went back and fourth with me over $5. Then agreed to do my nails over seeing it was mess, I'd declined. 2hrs in the shop, to come out with mess, no thank you. I'd waisted enough time and money. I've seen and heard Twan speak poorly to clients, but I've noticed he chooses whom he'll address properly and not based upon maybe looks. I don't know, but the way I was treated I'm still very hurt and upset. I didn't pay the $5, after I said, well I don't like being called a liar, I don't owe you anything. I already took a loss and wasn't going to complain at all, I refuse to do anymore. I said well what now. While holding my Alexander Wang \u00a0duffle bag, and zipping my Mackage jacket, nothing about me is broke. The principles and respect were the issue. They said they'd call the police, I said ok. And prepared to wait. They didn't attempt to call anyone, Twan, accused me of being a liar-, said he'd pay it, and I THEN got upset. Worse experience in my entire life!Twan doesn't respect his clients. Honestly, I don't leave reviews when upset, I just don't return to the place. After this I'm not only NOT returning, I'll tell everyone to not support them. I read other reviews, and I tell you, yes they are clean, but the craftsmanship is mediocre. There are other shops, I support local business, but this one will never get a dime from me or anyone I know.

But, of course, there are two men up front doing acrylics and running the place while 11 women are scurrying around handling all the ladies here today. Refer to my Fairy Nails review about the NYT article.My name was fifth on the waiting list but they called me by the time I picked my color. Unexplainably, the bulk of the colors are kept behind the men up front and check-out counter out of reach to get a good look at the color. Maybe people steal polish and this is their solution.I asked them to clean the pedi bowl before putting water in for me. They said they clean after every pedi so I'm waiting to see if that's the case when the next pedi finishes. One plantar's wart was enough. OK, I see a gal cleaning...still playing it safe and not putting my feet down except my heel.I asked the technician to clean the tools before starting. She said she already did but I asked her to do it again. They don't have their tools in disinfectant solution but, rather, just spray the tools with alcohol and wipe them. Ugh.As I look around, this place really is much nicer than Fairy Nails. It's much roomier, there's nice paint on the walls, some spa-like art work and a couple of nice tvs and the smell isn't overwhelming. And, again, it seems to be much, much cleaner. However, the waiting area is very small.The foot/leg massages in places like this are usually short, but my gal did a nice job. Also, they give new toe separaters to reach client.

I'm willing to let that slide as long as I receive proper service afterwards. Okay, I understand that during regular nail hours, everyone is here & the wait is long. Fine.

The buffet had no theme, just random food that appeared was leftover from the week. I decided to try the jambalaya, crab balls and stuffed claims. What a waste of food. The buffet is $20 per person and totally not worth it. The atmosphere is nice, parking is not bad; however the food is not worth the trip.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 6, 28]}, "11": {"description": "Was not impressed at all with the quality of food or the service", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 9, 12]}, "8": {"description": "Awesome!!! We came on a Sunday night at like 7 it was almost empty. I prefer it that way. They encouraged us to pick our table (another thing that I love). I ordered feticine Alfredo with chicken and my fiance ordered honey glazed porkchop with a side of French fries. The portion sizes are amazing!!!!! :-) the food is super flavorful. the unlimited salad bar rocks. We never did get the soup (unlimited soup and salad) but we didn't care. The food rocks!!! \u00a0The service is attentive without hovering and the bread rolls are warm and soft! \u00a0We WILL be coming back!!!!

There's no other place in the City of Chicago that delivers great food, great drinks, and excellent customer service every single time. From the wide variety of food choices, views of the lake, and great overall ambiance- the lake shore cafe is perfect. Oh and did I mention Mimosa's.. Get there I'm sure you'll love it.

The food was great. The band however are mid 60-70 yr old jazz musicians. They are ok if you are in that age bracket. The music is a bit loud, but I can't wait to take my dad this summer. Again, great seafood and a great place to take parents or grandparents. Oh yeah, all the older folks dress SOOO nice when they come there. We young people should take notes.
