I also like that I could have my breakfast and then proceed to the bar ten paces away. I gave it a 4.Brent was a little less sanguine on the experience and awarded an average 2.5. \"It was a good omelette but I didn't like the hash brows,\" he says.Another dissenter was Sasquatch (also 2.5), who thought his omelette was a little too runny and possibly undercooked. He explained this in the car on the way home because he didn't want to go on a Sasquatch-like rant in the restaurant. Although he did admit the bacon was good.Howard, who scouted this place, gave it a 4, and why not. To counter Brent's take on the hash browns Howard said that he preferred Cal Harbor's bronzed, shredded browns as opposed to the cubed variety.

Ok...I guess thats no biggie....anywho I went in on a monday night expecting beautiful bitches everywhere and a nice sexy enviroment. Instead I walk into a Block party at the Players club, I see a mother of 6, recovering alcohlics, and sticks on stilts. I felt like I was in a Lil Jon video. For a huge club like this which is very nice and sexually decorated I expected magic. And DEFINATELY a better selection of ladies. I cant lie though, I saw a few diamonds in the rough and some Big asses. But besides the BYOB rule and 5 out of 100 bad bitches....eh I think I'll pass", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 12, 22]}, "11": {"description": "Okkkkk...Soooo, I decided to charter a party bus to The Factory from Michigan for my birthday. I had heard wonderful things about the club. \u00a0WRONG! \u00a0WRONG! WRONG! Although I stayed in contact with the club promoter weeks before my initial party, I MIGHT AS WELL HADNT TALKED TO NOBODY because we were treated as such!! \u00a0We get to the club and was greeted by BIG ASS DUDES who seemed to be PMSing and were cramping bad!! They said we couldnt wear hats..fine, took them back to the bus. We get back he says, NO OPEN BOTTLES...so again..back to the bus. Finally get back and was frisked by the BIGGEST BITCH EVER (that prolly had hair on her back may I add). I get in the club, these clowns talking bout $40, when the promoter told me $15 no more than $20. I had 16 ppl with me.. you do the math. They were charging the guys $60. So we get in and it smells like catfish and taco powder, it \u00a0was over crowded... my shoes stuck to the gummy ass carpet..dudes grabbing random girls asses (LIGHT WEIGHT RAPIST)....everybody running around in a circle...outta da 50 chicks there it was only 2 worth looking at. I felt like my safety was being compromised. IT WAS A COMPLETE CIRCUS!!! We didnt even stay in the club longer than an hour before we were back on the party bus. DO NOT GO TO THIS GHETTO ASS...SEAFOOD & TACO BELL SMELLING..STD GATHERING SPOT.

Great club for girls and guys! Love the music, too! First of all, it's BYOB! I love that! \u00a0My girlfriends and I bought a bottle of vodka and was set for the night! So much cheaper then paying for drinks at the bar! They also have awesome food and a friendly staff, which is rare! Secondly the girls are HOT!!! There were all types but all beautiful. I got several private dances and trust me, they were great and reasonably priced ;-P Finally, It's aesthetically pleasing with beautiful modern decor. They have two rooms and lots of VIP space! It's a large, beautiful club with the perfect layout. Did I mention they have rooms with showers where you can watch girls dance? Where else can \u00a0you see that?! There is a jacuzzi outside too!

It is BYOB (bring your on booze) and they serve no alcohol. I went on a Saturday and it was dead from 8pm til 12pm.Another downside you HAVE to buy buckets of ice to keep your liquor cold (5 bucks a bucket).The place is huge but only six girls were in there.

I hope they do with this business what was done with Club 2000 years ago in Charlotte, N.C. A nightclub linked with two strip clubs for men and women. Factory's biggest set back is location and lack of transportation for those without. It can be seen off the expressway but isn't easily found once you exit. A few signs on the road would help. If you're an Internet sleuth you can score passes online, otherwise cover is typically $15-$20, I believe there was a mandatory valet cost which was minimal. Good to know there is some kind of security in the lot. This club blows many others off the beaten path with their stylish d\u00e9cor, helpful staff and clubby atmosphere; that is until you've been seated. I hope it's gained more popularity since our visit some time ago. Ladies are lovely and seems to have moved here with the publicity; from neighboring clubs. Some staff has travelled from as far as Milwaukee and Michigan just for the opportunity to dance at a mega club. The club is a dry bar, so you have to bring your own. It is hard to find any liquor sales nearby and you'll have to drive a great distance for that, so plan ahead otherwise you'll be stuck with a cost of $20 for a carafe of juice! Most ladies are welcoming with a decent stage presence and receptive in welcoming you to their club. Many of their entertainers are reflective of the types of nationalities found in Chicago. Please, please, don't be cheap ass. If you want company at your table let yourself be heard via decent tips. Tip the stages, your waitresses, etc. The night I stopped in only one of two dance areas were in use. A single long stage with a length close to a basketball court with around three poles with two entertainers dancing at a time, encircled with seats. Dances were approximately $35 per song or 3 for $100 if you went for the best of dances, $25 for the regular. There are other options like shower dances or watching your entertainer in a Jacuzzi. If you plan on staying awhile, want info on having a party or just want to see it all, ask for a tour. Management is willing to show off a bit. Right now it's a decent club and with some work, more popularity and a thriving night club scene added in, it could be an awesome time in the future. But with staunch competition like Scores, PoleKatz and Industrial strip it's going to have to do a lot more to distinguish itself from the rest. I know that our group was thoroughly annoyed with their pricing on everything from dances to beverages for mixing with our booze. Currently I've heard their club scene happens on Thursday nights with Latin music and topless dancers.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 11, 30]}, "8": {"description": "Should do well as a nightclub and If the do this, I hope the owners do it right. \u00a0Girls are so-so. \u00a0Mostly women from other clubs. \u00a0Some 10s, some downright hood chicks with the tudes', tatts and tramp stamps. \u00a0Some bi strippers also. \u00a0Customers are mostly local peoples, lots of bi and lesbian women too. \u00a0Seeing lesbians flock to a strip bar in groups is new to me, anywayz.Here are the charges: $6 valet. $20 cover (go online and Google them, you can get half price passes and free ones too)Dances:Table dance: Didn't know they offered these, not sure if I trust Jade J.Lap dance: $25 each song.
