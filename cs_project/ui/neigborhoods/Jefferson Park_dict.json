When I asked for about it the woman behind the counter seemed confused and didn't know there was a deal. Then I asked for a refund and she said it was not possible since I did not pay with cash. I find that hard to believe that a transaction is not able to be canceled or refunded. There was no attempts to apologize for this, merely a shrug of the shoulders.The second poor experience isn't as bad. I asked for a pound of coffee as it is locked up. She scanned it and began to charge me when I asked if it was whole bean. She looked at the bag and said \"Yeah, I think so\". I then looked and found it said ground. Not a huge deal, just surprising that an employee at a dunkin donuts wouldn't know the difference between whole bean and ground coffee.The last and most upsetting experience that made me decide that I will never return. I asked for two lattes, again still $1.99 deal. She told me she could only do one at that price, when I said that I was able to get two at that price at many other locations she just looked at me blankly. I asked her to ring it up as two separate transactions, she didn't want to but obliged. I watched her make the lattes. The milk for the latte was not fresh, it was sitting in the container that it gets steamed in. So no clue how long that had been sitting there. Then once she steamed the milk and finished the lattes she found that there was not enough steamed milk for both lattes. So she took one latte and topped it off with fresh milk and just mixed the drink with a spoon.

She came back on the phone and much to my surprise, said the baker knew how to make the raspberry Bavarian cream and agreed to make a white cake with that filling and buttercream frosting. On May 18th, I went in to the bakery and ordered and paid for the cake. Milagros ( counter girl) even went back and spoke to the baker and hand wrote ( Roberto knows) on my printed receipt \"White cake, Raspberry Bavarian cream filling and Vanilla Buttercream frosting.\"The picture from the shower invite was too small, so I was given a card with their email address to send a picture of what we wanted on the cake. I sent an email reiterating the type of cake, filling and frosting along with the picture I wanted transferred to the cake. I received no response, so sent another email with my original email asking for an email confirmation or a phone call. When I still received no response, I went into the bakery with the picture to be transferred to the cake. At this time, I again went over the type of cake, filling and frosting. I even stated I didn't want layer of Bavarian cream with raspberries on top, wanted it mixed. The counter girl went back and the baker assured her he knew how to make raspberry Bavarian cream and it would be blended.I was also told they never received my email.On June 7th, I picked up the cake and four pounds of cookies I had ordered. Imagine my dismay, when the cake was cut and it was YELLOW cake. There was also a layer of cream with raspberries on top of it, not blended at all.Seeing that the cake and cookies were our only dessert, we served it. On June 9th, I called the bakery to express my disappointment with the cake. Pam who answered the phone said the \"Owner isn't in. I could call back the next day.\" I called the next day and relayed what had happened with the cake. The woman on the phone relayed my message to the owner who said \"I shouldn't have served it and brought it back for a refund.\" Really? Their mistake and we are suppose to tell our guests, sorry no cake for you. Eat the cookies? Needless to say, I was less than pleased with this flippant response. I went in to the bakery and spoke to Joanna the manager. She also told me we should have returned the cake and not served it. She then proceeded to tell me they don't even make white cake. She asked if I had a picture of the cake, and how did she know it was the wrong type? I told her I had some of the cake at home and would be happy to return it so she could see it was wrong. I also added, if you don't make white cake why wouldn't anyone tell me that and why are you questioning it was yellow? Why would it be printed on my receipt? \"She offered me a $10.00 refund. I told her that was not satisfactory and I planned on Yelping a review of my experience. She then asked, \"Are you threatening me?\" My response, \"Absolutely not, I am just telling you that if this is not resolved to my satisfaction, I will relay my experience.\" I also mentioned the two emails I sent and had my iPad to show her the emails. She went in the back for 10 minutes and came back out and told me they ended up in Spam and they never check their Spam. Keep that in mind brides ;( Not very reassuring. Joanna finally after 45 minutes of arguing with me refunded the price of the cake minus the $10.00 for the transfer, \"because nothing was wrong with that.\" I will NEVER patronize this bakery again due to their terrible customer service. All this aggravation over a $38.00 cake. The woman who held the shower loved the cake and was planning on having them make the cake for her wedding,(450 + guests. ) Another guest was going to use the bakery for two bridal showers she is hosting. After hearing of my disastrous experience, both have wisely chosen to go elsewhere.While the customer is NOT always right, I believe Chicago Sweet connection really dropped the ball and lost hundreds of dollars in business over a $38.00 cake.

They were not fresh fruit, it was a glaze or some sort of disgusting \u00a0goo. I believe this cake was not fresh. I have ordered fabulous cakes from them in the past, but these two were so bad, I feel like a horrible mother because I could not hold in my emotions when I took a bite of the cake. I know the others at my home felt it was an okay cake, but for the price, not good. I don't know if they are in the practice that other bakers use where they freeze freshly baked cakes and have them on hand for people who order the last minute, but that would be the only thing that explained it. The yellow cake itself tasted grainy. It was not a nice fluffy yellow in taste or appearance. This is why I felt it was an older cake. Me personally, will never order another cake from them.

Sometimes it hides behind the name of margarine or shortening. On the ingredient list for the cake one of the ingredients was \"cake shortening\". I called up the bakery to ask more specifically what it was.My question seemed complicated to the lady I was speaking to. I asked what it was, she put me on hold to ask a baker, she said it was vegetable oil, I asked if it was hydrogenated oil, she put me on hold again to ask someone else, then came back and told me that it was just vegetable oil. It almost sounded as if she had never heard of hydrogenated oil, so I asked if that specific oil was solid or in liquid form. (hydrogenated being solid) and without putting me on hold to ask someone she answered right away that it was liquid vegetable oil.I'm not sure if her quick answer was because she was becoming impatient with my questions and assumed all vegetable oil came in liquid form (it does not) or if she really knew what she was talking about.A problem I have with it being \"just vegetable oil\" is what makes it so special that it has to be listed as \"cake shortening\"?The next time I get something from them, I'm going straight to their location to ask a baker myself what ingredients they use.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 1, 3]}, "19": {"description": "Any bakery with a line outside the door before it opens has to be good!

You won't find anything like Moy Lee's elsewhere. First, they make their own sweet n sour sauce. Not of this processed, hot pink-colored sticky sauce. Theirs is just the right amount of sweet (I think they put oranges in there) and just the right amount of sour (apples I think) and it's this warm orange color that makes it appetizing. They steam their rice to perfection. I like to eat it on the side bc it's just so good plain. For years I couldn't break of of my Sweet n Sour Delight cycle. If you like sweet n sour you'll love this dish! Chicken, pork and huge shrimp in crispy deep-fried batter with that delicious sauce! Oh my goodness, to die for!!!The egg rolls are huge, about the size of my head and filled to the brim with Chinese cabbage, bbq pork and assorted veggies. Fried to perfection it's the perfect appetizer. The rangoons are also worth getting as you can actually see and tasts the crabmeat inside. Last night I has the Sai Woo duck. I've only had it once before while dining here with a party of 8 and we had to share all our dishes so I didn't get enough of this delicious dish. Finally, I had it all to myself.

They have a parking lot, accessible from public transport(85a, or 85 going towards the terminal). Located right on the corner on Central and Elston, how convenient! I agree with the others...

It was a Friday during Lent, and I was on a search for a fish fry in Illinois. I settled on fish and chips.With the St. Patrick's Day festivities going on, it was difficult to determine if the lack of a seat at 7pm on a Friday was due to the popularity of the bar, or the fact that many people were out celebrating the holiday early. In any case, we took the one open table they had upstairs (yes, there's an upstairs), ordered up a couple beers immediately, and put in for our fish and chips.It was loud. Really, really loud. Again, I think it was part of the festivities related to St. Patrick's Day weekend, but Irish music was blaring through the speakers, one of which was located directly above us. Plus, pretty frequently during the evening, there were two lovely Irish dancers dancing up and down the aisles of the restaurant. It was fun to watch, but I think that Irish dancers wouldn't be an everyday occurrence.Due to the place being packed, service was a bit slow, but nothing that was unexpected given the amount of people there. We weren't checked on very frequently, but we were asked if we wanted another round of both beer an fish. I declined, but my husband enjoyed more.As for the food itself, it was good, especially given how much food they must have been preparing.

There is very little in the way of wall texts to explain his art or give it context, and the half-hour video presentation is raw footage, not a full-fledged finely honed exploration of its subject. Ed does say in the video that he didn't enjoy his classes at the Art Institute in the 1960's; he preferred the Pop Art appearing in New York at the time. Still, I was left to wonder what artists influenced or inspired him, what stages his career passed through, where his wild use of color stems from, why bullets and guns are so prominent a motif in his work, and many other things. In the video there were images of black and white posters for his shows that looked terrific; I would have enjoyed seeing a selection of posters in the gallery.

My apologies.Positives:The sheep are cute. They did price match my mattress cover with Amazon's price, but if saving a few pennies is important you would still save on Amazon since city tax isn't included. \u00a0It wasn't to me so I left it that way. \u00a0Store set-up was explained and is pretty straight forward. Mattress arranged by mattress line from cheapest to most expensive.Pricing: The mattress was cheaper than the online price and the first salesman did lower it a little for me. \u00a0He was eager to sell. I suggest checking the sales ads on the website first. \u00a0 Other Thoughts: The salesman may have been too eager. He gave me one pitch after another even disparaging their competitor which is not good practice. I didn't feel comfortable trying out the mattresses there. The one liner sales pitches and my gut should have been enough to tell me to shop around a little more.Refund Policy:They do not offer refunds. I am used to Costco who gives refunds even on mattresses from what friends have told me. \u00a0I know it is standard practice now, but they should mention that to the customer anyways, especially if it is mentioned it is their first purchase. \u00a0I made the mistake of not asking out of ignorance. I found out looking at the receipt. \u00a0I was told it was \"standard practice\" not to get a refund when I returned a second time. I checked their competitors website that are \"Experts\" and they will refund your money but you have to wait for the check to be sent. \u00a0I believe I saw it in FAQ. Sales pitches I was given you should be careful of....Delivery: The salesman said, \"For YOU I will waive the delivery charge.\" It was free delivery period. \u00a0It was on the website at the time.\"We guarantee the price for 60 days!\" \u00a0They don't tell you is that it is not really possible to find the same mattress. \u00a0I am not sure if the names are changed and/or the styles are altered slightly at competitors. Not sure what it is. \u00a0The site says it needs to be the same style, size and color. \u00a0\"You don't need to shop anywhere else! Everything you need is right here!\". \u00a0They only sell Serta mattresses. \u00a0If you are looking to compare different brands that are similar this is not the place. (Update: I was told by the manager at another store (Diversey) that they have the widest selection of Tempurpedic).It must be my \"perception\" so the manager said when I returned to exchange.My mattress didn't seem as firm as the store one. \u00a0I went back to the store this time when the manager was there. \u00a0The store one felt better. \u00a0I am not sure why. \u00a0Maybe the temperature difference. \u00a0I didn't get an intelligent answer from the manager except that it must be my perception. \u00a0(Update: I found out the the type of top it had shouldn't be affected by the temperature even though it had foam from the manager at a different store so who knows.)\"Maybe you should come back for her at 6:45 before the store closes after she takes a nap.\" I decided to take more time in deciding on a mattress in the same line before exchanging because you are allowed to change once. \u00a0The chiropractor told me that salesman at a store will not think you are weird for trying out a mattress for 10 minutes. \u00a0The manager made comments that made me feel just that while laying on a mattress for more than a 5 minutes at time on each of the two mattresses I was deciding on. I left he store after that.I learned a lot from my first mattress buying experience and I dread the next one. \u00a0Hope you have a better one and this review helps.

I go in and she takes a look at my hair. She all but insults it. Stating she did do black hair before but it was finer and the curls weren't as loose. She then asked if I ever received Keratin before and were other stylists ok with working on my hair. Not something you should say to a client. She tells me she is not comfortable with working with my hair. I didn't want someone who had reservations about doing my hair to touch it so I got up and left. She apologized but I am hesitant to accept it. I think she didn't want to dedicate the time to do the Keratin for $99. I think she might have dedicated the time if I was paying full price. Two, if you are a hairdresser then you should know how to work on different hair textures. All my Keratins that I received before was done by Caucasian women and they didn't have a problem doing it. Three, it's not a good idea to insult your client's hair.

The convenience is matched by none, considering I take the Blue line into the Jefferson Park Transit center (this place is literally across the street in Veterans Square). I went in around 11 a.m. on a Tuesday, hoping to get a reverse French no-chip. Let me start off by saying, I was immediately seated at a nail desk and an employee began removing my old no-chip. She was friendly, but extremely harsh with taking off the polish (not allowing them to soak long enough in the acetone foil strips). My nails felt extremely weak once she got my previous no-chip off. No-chip application:After my previous no-chip was removed, a different girl came out to do my nails. Normally, this is no problem and she was just as friendly as the last. I showed her a picture of the reverse French that I wanted, and she said she understand exactly what I wanted. She has a stylus for touch screens that she allowed me to borrow, so I could continue to use my phone, as she worked my nails. That part was awesome. When she was cleaning up my cuticles, she was too aggressive, and made three of my fingers bleed. By the third finger, I let out an \"Ow!\" to get her attention. I understand cuticles occasionally bleed, especially when it's dry out. Three fingers, though, wasn't acceptable to me. Rather than applying the solution to stop the bleeding, she wiped away the blood and proceeded to move on to painting...the only problem - my cuticles were still bleeding. She began applying no-chip polish over the blood seeping onto my nail bed, and it stung! I pointed this out to her, and she /then/ whipped out the product to stop the bleeding, but did not re-do the polish that was now drying into a blood mixture. She explained that she had left her stencils at home, but assured me she'd be fine with the reverse French. I've had plenty of nail techs free-hand my French manis without a stencil and done a beautiful job. This, however, was sloppy and uneven. She also applied WAY to much. I had a thick mound of no-chip polish at the base, and a thinner coat above that.Overall:I have only been here once, so perhaps I had a uniquely bad experience, but I'd much rather spend the extra 5 min to drive to another salon that does a more professional job, than spend 2 weeks looking down at my nails and hating them.

I took a bite of the burger and it was filled with onion. I had to immediately spit it out. My husband had to run to walgreens across the street to get me some benedryl. I went into the bathroom to rinse my mouth and try to stop coughing. I had already taken my usual allergy meds in the morning. I finally came out of the bathroom. I explained to the waiter the situation my allergy and why I did not want another burger since the meat contain onion. The manager never came over. She wasn't concerned with my well being in her restaurant at all. The server asked if he could get me something else. I ordered a waffle and drank my husbands coffee to help me breath and took the benedryl. I could hardly eat anything after that incident. The manager was still unconcerned. The waiter took off the burger from my bill and apologized again. My husband took the bill up the manager and explained to her what had happened. She was not concerned and said she'd see what she do. She later came to the table and offered us half off the waffle and of course no charge on the burger. She continued that if I had explained to the waiter that I had an allergy this wouldn't of happened. I told her I had explained it several times that I could not have any onion. I'm speaking with her and still gasping for breath just to have a conversation. She didn't ask if I needed medical attention. She wasn't concerned at all. She said if I had ordered the turkey burger or chicken burger those didn't contain onion and I would be fine. Then she asked if i was satisfied with what I ordered. I said no. I wanted a burger without onion. I was not expecting to die that day. She was very unconcerned. I did not like how she handle things. We paid out bill and left. My whole day was ruined.

Perhaps not inevitably, but today I feel like believing in destiny, so let's just go with it. As a physical space, this bar has what it takes-- a bar, some stools, booths, booze. It looked like old patterned wall paper had been painted over with black paint, or else they'd managed to get mold underneath the walls to grown in an intricate fleur de lis pattern. The walls are also adorned with mirrors (to help you surreptitiously check people out, I guess?) and kitschy art including a classy Rita Hayworth print and a less classy \"Beauty is in the eye of the beerholder\" sign with an anthropomorphic beer mug with a face and legs (and maybe genitals, but I couldn't tell and really wasn't in the mood to ponder it). Populating this space was a nice mix of patrons, including quiet drinkers in deep contemplation and a group of people who were getting their crunk on in a most civilized manner. My favorites were the couple engaged in an elaborate juke-box based flirtation in the back room, including a pseudo lap dance and a lip sync rendition of \"You're the one that I want\" from Grease. There was also some girl on girl grinding dance action, which, for a bulk of the population, is a guaranteed aphrodisiac. The bartender was sweet and attentive, able to rattle off the fairly significant beer list off the top of her head, and checked in with us at our booth a couple of times, which I appreciated.

My naivet\u00e9 baited me in here especially since the signs on the front stated that piercings were $30, and I was jonesin' for a septum ring.I walked into an empty parlor on a weekday afternoon. There was no one there for about a minute, and finally a man approached me. I initially thought this guy was a plumber because he had zero tattoos or piercings and wore the type of clothing one would wear when fixing toilets. He said he was the piercer to which I said, \"Oh, ok.\" He then had me sign paperwork and all that liability jazz. Now, I knew I was getting a $30 dollar piercing the moment when I felt him slowly twisting the needle inside my nose. I started to cry spontaneously because of the natural nerve irritation and the fact that it hurt so much I felt like the crazy dude from \"Saw\" booby trapped my face and this man was digging for the key that would prevent him from dying a painful gut-wrenching death. I also started to bleed profusely from my nose which was strange since this has never happened before. Moving onto other horror films, I began to look like one of Michael Meyer's victims from Rob Zombie's \"Halloween\". I also told this dude that I needed to be able to flip my ring in for work and he assured me I would be able to do that. ANYWHOOO. Next morning before I had to go to work, LO' AND BEHOLD the ring would not flip inside my nose. I tried. My boyfriend tried. It was no use. The barbells were fused too tightly together and this ring was as stubborn as a mule and would not budge whatsoever. My only choice at the time was going back to that parlor and demand that I get this problem fixed. I ended up having to miss work which was fucking ridiculous because my boss said that septum rings are kinda hardcore and may frighten the geriatric clientele at my work. When I returned to the shop the second time, I was greeted by a different piercer. I explained to her what happened and she said she'd be able to fix it. Thankfully she was able to separate the barbells and I was able to flip the ring inside.Lesson learned: stay away from \u00a0piercers who don't have piercings or tattoos.

No, you will leave happy and confident that you were well taken care of.I started coming to Chitown right after I turned 18, a few years ago. The first thing I got done was my tongue piercing by Sean. He's one of the best. I've seen his tattoo work, he's funny, and he's not only talented, but extremely professional. I've never felt more comfortable in my life.Fast forward to a few months later. I went back to get my belly button pierced. Kelly did that and, again, I had no issues with the piercing. Another super outgoing personality and a piercer who knows what the hell she's doing.Continue on to when I got my eyebrow and lip pierced, both by Chuck. I, unfortunately, had to take these out for the new job I got, but Chuck is the best. When I got my piercings done, he suggested a placement, and me, being the know-it-all I think I am, ended up changing the placement. He complied and I ended up realizing I should've taken his advice at the beginning. You'll notice how a smidge of a centimeter can make all the difference, and Chuck knows his placement. He's always there when I go back now and I wouldn't want to go to anyone else again. He is older and wiser than 99% of any piercer I know.I have gone to other shops (won't name names) in the area, and none compare. I had my industrial and other piercings done at another place, and ended up coming back to Chitown for issues I had with those. I was in yesterday with an industrial problem. The bar was so short that it didn't heal properly. Chuck immediately looked at it, and even though it was done at another shop, offered to clean me up and change it to the proper healing jewelry. He had their apprentice, Dani, do the piercing change. I was a little nervous having her do it instead of Chuck, but he was there the entire time, and she made the entire process painless even though my piercing had been giving me pain the past few months.I finally went in for a tattoo tonight. I got it done by David who was fantastic. Excuse me for being a puss, but it was my first tattoo and I almost passed out, despite the fact that it's about 1inx3in in size. He immediately calmed me down, grabbed water, and made sure I was good to go before he started again. He took his time with the line work and made sure I loved it. I'll admit, I was picky as hell about it, having him adjust things before we finished. And he was such a good guy about it. I probably drove him nuts with all my nit-picking, but he never once rushed me even though I was there past closing time.Another great thing is the pricing. It's affordable and you get quality. Normally the saying is \"you get what you pay for\", but I've never been able to get a $30 piercing and have it come out flawless. The other piercings I've paid top dollar for at the other shop were the ones I ended up coming back to have looked at/fixed. I had gone in for a tattoo quote and, contrary to what another Yelper said, David held his word. Dani even gave me a business card with the quote, date, and David's name on it to confirm when I came back if needed. I trust these people so much. They remember you, they treat you well, they let you hang out for a conversation when you're there, and they make you feel like you belong. My biggest love for this place is that they care. Before and after anything you get done, they take the time to explain everything to you. They make sure you know how to care for your tattoo/piercing before you walk out that door. And if you come back with an issue, they take care of you right away. Every single person in there knows what they are doing and can assist you just as good as the last person you saw. It's a place that truly cares about their clients and has a full fledged team of skilled and professional employees, all the way from the owner to the apprentice, and that's as good as it gets for me.

(This review is based on my outline and shading. But I can only bet that the coloring will be as great as an experience)Exceptional artistry work done by Angel. He used a computer program that allowed us to make adjustments to the tattoo (prior to printing out the stencil) to make sure I was happy with all of the flowers, leaves, placement, size, and we decided on colors to help figure out what the colors of the outline should be. I did not feel rushed at all by him as we were brainstorming before our session. He let me watch movies and a couple episodes of grey's anatomy :D (lovveeee!) haha and he dealt with my yips and yelps of pain and was very professional!The only negative thing I've encountered the entire time was when we were wrapping up. Barry was getting me cleaned off and applying ointment/plastic wrap, and a rude co worker barged in. He stood at the opening of the door, and barked orders for Barry to pierce someone right at that second... and to not keep him waiting. I found out this idiot's name was Tyler. Instead of waiting a five minutes to finish up with a client, Tyler demanded that he drop everything to tend to some other customer.

She asked me to hold for Eric who picked up in about 90 seconds or less.(2) Our conversation was like this: 'I'm sorry you are unhappy. When can I come out to fix this? I am available anytime today or next week except Monday (holiday).\" I agreed that today would be good and Eric's reply was: 'I'm leaving right now. I'll see you in a few minutes.'(3) When Eric arrived he was cordial and personable, the all around 'nice guy'. I could not be happier! I explained the problems I still had outstanding and he says: 'I'll fix those right now!' He went to his truck, got the necessary parts and fixed every single issue! In one hour my garage door was secure and I was once again a happy camper. And he did all of this without a cape! Super Job!!!

Eventually I walked into this place after seeing all the ads for the new bacon club burger. The burger looked good, but just like the \"angus\" burger I expected disappointment. This Mcdonalds for the most part is kept clean and is not run down. There weren't many people in here since it was the evening (around 6:30-7pm.) I stepped up to the plate, ordered my bacon club burger combo. It was about $7.35 for the combo, a bit steep for Mcdonalds standards so I was expecting something better than average. Boy oh boy was I surprised! Wow I mean whoever prepare this burger must see themselves as a \"burger artist\" because it looked as if it came straight off the poster. The taste was fantastic as well, is this truly Mcdonalds or was my drink spiked with LSD, making me hallucinate I'm in an alternate reality where Mcdonalds is a 5 star restaurant. I mean there was real applewood bacon on this thing, not the thin bland strips we're accustomed to. The meat was great, bun looked nice, lettuce was fresh. The sauce they put on it really brought out the flavor, what the heck is going on? As I walked out in disbelief I noted that this place warranted a second visit.Upon my second visit I decided to order different things on the surprisingly off the wall menu here. I haven't been to Mcdonalds in a while so maybe they made some changes, but I ordered the buffalo ranch McChicken and bbq bacon Mcdouble. Immediately upon walking into the restaurant I spotted what looked like blood on the flood at the registers. Was there a fist fight earlier? Or did one of the \"classy\" Mcdonalds customers just spit on the floor while they were waiting for their order? Honestly it could be either one. Got my order in under 3 minutes again and ate them while I waited at the train station. Ah, the usual crappy taste of the McChicken/Chicken Sponge only this time paired with cheap ranch and buffalo sauce. One would think with them upping their game with that club sandwich they'd actually soak the chicken in buffalo sauce or at least toss it with the sauce not just throw a few squirts on after it's been cooked. The bacon Mcdouble had those crappy thin strips and I don't know what was going on with the meat, but it was like eating a rice cake or something. Something tells me the meat on the Mcdouble was near its expiration date.Overall this place is better than most Mcdonalds. They get your order out fast, don't have long lines, and from what I've seen they have decent people for customers (aside from the mysterious blood on the floor).

Gone but will never be forgotten!The other dishes are also prepared from diffrent recipes and gone are the original tasty homemade dishes that were unique and different \u00a0than anyother Chinese food restaurant that we have purchased from the past.With that being said,and not to dwell on the past,we ordered two nights ago from grub hub.We had S&S chicken,egg roll, combo fried rice and \u00a0beef egg fu young.I had requested for my SS to be separated from the chicken ,this way it wouldn't be soggy.This wasn't the case. Unfortunately the temprua was saturated, soggy, and literally just falling right off the chicken. It was mushy.I called and the gentlemen that answered,said my order did not state I wanted it separately. I wasn't looking for reimbursement nor a replacement, just to shine a light on the overlooked request. I double checked my order from grub hub just to be sure..and indeed I did.. It ruined my meal for the most part,but I did make the best of it. What I do really appreciate is the fact you have many options for the fried rice for a small up charge of 75 cents you can upgrade your fried rice and I had chicken pineapple \u00a0it was supposed to be spicy according to the drop down menu but it wasn't ,however the chicken was clean it was white chicken meat the rice was decent although I do miss the old recipe. The combo fried rice was ok says my husband. Although fresh and a ample amount of meat,it lacked something. After adding soy sauce he seemed to enjoy it a little more. He said he just wasn't used it it. I could tell it seemed fresh and on the healthier side. Guess we do get used to things a certain way. But that doesn't mean we can't change :)The egg fu young was good. We asked for it well done,and they nailed it...however some improvement could be made with the gravy. Its watery. Over all it technically is a New establishment and seeing that they bought it out from the old owners which I believe was their sister they have a different spin on the food and it was fresh and it was quality. I did not like the egg roll @ all ..l even with it being the status quo .I would give it a try again with the knowledge that this is not the old golden wok.

I've never had that even with cheap grocery store sushi. 3rd was pick up: 3 pieces with ligament (barf), scallop was weird texture (I didn't even finish it), the Godzilla roll presentation was disgusting. you'd think signature roll would be beautiful but it looked like scraps of fish on top, weird chunks like I've never seen on a roll. Usually when it's a top it's beautiful slices layered, right?But my biggest reason for my post is my current gastrointestinal distress. I've thankfully eaten a lot of sushi and never been sick.

Also, small portions are nice for someone looking to grab a quick small lunch, which given its proximity to the Jeff Park CTA is wonderful.

Its conveniently located, quiet little joint. I haven't seen many people dine in, which is probably because they do take out AND delivery.

For 2.95 each plate, its a bargain lunch or dinner! I recommend the tiger roll, crunchy spicy salmon roll (drool), and spicy scallop roll. Not a huge fan of the volcano roll, but if you're my boyfriend and LOVE spicy mayo, its calling you. If you love sashimi, I strongly suggest getting the chirashi don.

My goal was to achieve something that looks 100% natural in color, thickness, shape, and technique. \u00a0After doing a lot of research and looking at before and afters online, I determined that the hair stroke technique would be the best method to use to create the look I wanted. \u00a0Then I did a lot of searching within the Chicago area to determine which place I should go to. \u00a0It was a little tough finding this place and I think I got lucky stumbling across it because it isn't the typical place located in the River North/Gold Coast area. \u00a0It was tempting to go to one of these places too because I kind of just assumed they would be good based on other aspects of the business, but not actually the work itself if that makes sense (more reviews, location, better website, etc). \u00a0BUT, then I found Katrina- I saw before and after pics on Facebook, read that she won a reward almost 15 years ago for best permanent makeup in Orlando, and saw that she has years of experience practicing this technique. \u00a0Her portfolio was way better than those from places located in the downtown area so I ultimately decided to go to OM Spa.So now to the actual work itself. \u00a0Katrina used three different techniques to create the hair strokes. \u00a0You have two appointments when you do a full-set of eyebrows. \u00a0In the first, we spent a lot of time discussing what I wanted to achieve and creating the shape I was happy with (1.5 hrs) before she ever started to do the permanent makeup. \u00a0 Katrina works with your natural bone structure and brow line to ensure that it complements your face so that in the long-run it will still flatter you. She is a perfectionist and was constantly measuring, adding/removing the tiniest amount here and there until it was just right before she began. \u00a0She applied numbing cream and then did microblading and softap. \u00a0Everybody's pain tolerance is different, but I would say it was a little uncomfortable but totally bearable. \u00a0It's hard to be completely happy right after since your eyebrows will look way too dark (in 5 days they lighten to the appropriate shade) and need to heal, but I could tell they would get there. \u00a0Overall, I was happy once they healed and confident in my decision to work with her- but the best comes after the second appointment when she does touch up and adds on. \u00a0It's easier to add-on than try to correct a mistake so the first appointment for myself was getting a good base to work with to make it easier to add on in the second appointment. \u00a03 weeks later I had my second appointment (this one lasted two hours instead of three) and I finally got the look I was going for. \u00a0Numbing cream again and hair stroke technique using a different method (can't remember the name). \u00a0They look even, natural, normal and not like a tacky eyebrow tattoo that you can spot a mile away. \u00a0Can't wait to go to swimming and still have a full set of eyebrows.Overall, her prices are very reasonable and the touch-up is included. \u00a0Katrina truly is a professional and knows what she is doing. \u00a0She gives great advice and takes pride in her work and I am even going back for a facial although I have never done one in my life! \u00a0Take aways:- Awesome work- Great prices- Sterile and clean - Professional and personable- Relaxing environment. \u00a0You don't feel like one of many clients that they are trying to rush out the door.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 31]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Jefferson Park"], "latitude": 41.9679412841797, "longitude": -87.7754592895508, "rating": "5.0", "times": {"Mon": ["10:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Thu": ["10:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sat": ["9:00 am", "5:00 pm"], "Wed": ["10:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Tue": ["10:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sun": [], "Fri": ["10:00 am", "7:00 pm"]}, "price": "$$", "categories": [["Skin Care", "skincare"], ["Permanent Makeup", "permanentmakeup"], ["Tattoo Removal", "tattooremoval"]], "address": ["5910 W Lawrence Ave", "Ste A"], "attributes": {"Parking": "Street, Private Lot", "By Appointment Only": "Yes", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes", "Accepts Bitcoin": "No", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes"}, "category": "Beauty", "number_of_reviews": "9"}, "collettis-chicago": {"comments": {"58": {"description": "We used to eat here every couple of weeks but we have stopped patronizing the place since shortly after summer.

This was my first experience at Coletti's and if it wasn't for the company I was with I would have had an unsatisfactory experience at this restaurant. \u00a0I came here with my two bosses and 7 co-workers for an out-of-the office fun time and dine. We were greeted by our server (whom I wish not to name to save embarrassment) who seemed very nice in the beginning but did mention, however, that the restaurant was going through a shift change (don't know what she was insinuating). We placed our drinks and appetizer orders and our server was very efficient in brining out the appetizers and drinks in a timely fashion. Drinks were also being refilled quickly, which was great for a ten-person party. We had two orders of fried calamari, bread baskets with garlic infused olive oil, and two separate flat bread orders (one was sausage and tomato and the other was cheese and spinach, I think). The appetizers were delicious! I was excited to see what else was in store. We then placed our entree order and I ordered the aged 14oz. New York strip steak. As a steak lover, I was so excited to try it out. I don't doubt that I ordered the most expensive item on the menu: this steak was $28.99 or something crazy like that and I also upgraded to the \"gourmet\" Mac and Cheese as a side, which was $6.99. \u00a0I requested my steak to be encrusted in Parmesan cheese if possible, and asked for the brandy peppercorn sauce on the side for an additional $2 per request for a total of an additional $4. After our orders had been placed, it appeared we were then turned over to another server named Stephanie. This was exciting because prior to dining at Coletti's, I went on yelp to read the reviews (of course) and saw a nice review of Stephanie. Also, by this time our server seemed to be irritated by us and was popping over our shoulders to drop things off without saying a word and then rushing away. I didn't know why the change of attitude over the span of 30 minutes. Stephanie mentioned that out server was off for the day or something like that so that might have explained it. Anyway, it turned out Stephanie made a mistake and we were tossed back over to our previous server. Next, we all got our soups or salads and I chose the Caesar salad, which was delicious. When our entrees finally arrived I was horrified. I asked for my steak medium-rare but it was medium. They also put this weird Parmesan blob up top which was not a crust in the slightest. The \"gourmet\" Mac and Cheese tasted worse than Kraft Mac and Cheese and came in this tiny dish. And worst of all, my steak tasted like charcoal. The outside of my steak had beautiful grill marks so I could not, for the life of me, explain why it tasted like it had been burnt. I tell you, if it wasn't for the appetizers, I would have been starving by now. Also, thank goodness my boss paid for all of our meals or else I would have easily spent over $40 on my entree alone. But I feel terrible that she had to pay for something that was easily the most expensive item on the menu. Needless to say, I left 70% of my meal untouched and wrapped it up to go so I could have my parter try it (doubt that she'll finish it though). Also, our server was by this time was providing us with downright rude service. You can see it all over her face that she was upset and ready to go home or whatever. Next, we had dessert and I ordered the turtle chocolate sundae which was also delicious. When our server brought the check, she was eager to finish with us and was standing behind my boss over her shoulder waiting for payment and asking how much gratuity to add to the check. My boss generously tipped twenty percent which is more than I would have done. I am rating Coletti's two stars because the most important factors in a dining experience is the entree and the service which were both unsatisfying.

This was after reserving the room I wanted with the owner Bob Colletti months in advance. \u00a0Two days before my event, I received a call from Bob telling me I would no longer be in the room I requested. \u00a0His reason was because he had a larger party he needed to accommodate and that my party would be put in a smaller room. \u00a0 Even though when we reserved the room, we told him we would have between 25 - 30 guest and he said that is fine for that room. \u00a0However when I received his call, he mentioned 25 was too small which is why he switched me. \u00a0Because of all these last minute changes, we did not have enough centerpieces for the tables, menus, or room to play our games comfortably. When the actual event started, tables were too small for family style dining so our waitress and my sister had to remove all the extra dining ware to make room for the platters. \u00a0The family style food was okay (a bit too salty) as far as flavor but it was very scarce. \u00a0Very small amounts of food considering it was $22 per person. \u00a0Also, the strawberry sorbet was awful; it tasted old. During the event Bob never came to check on our party and worst of all NEVER apologize for all of the last minute changes.

Last Saturday was my first time going to this practice. I would have never drove over an hour out of my way to go see an eye doctor, but Dr.Gupta relocated here from a location that was closer to my house. Since I do not trust anyone else with my eyes, I knew I had to make the drive...and was it worth it!! The technology is beyond what other clinics have; that after all these years of going to eye clinics, this was the first one that I was actually in awe. Dr. Golie makes sure she has the most advanced technology in order to diagnose patients and even has herbal alternatives for eye drops readily available for purchase. The whole staff makes you feel very welcome, relaxed and not rushed whatsoever. The office closed at 4 and I was there well over 30-40 minutes after closing time and NOT ONCE did I feel like I was being rushed out. I did have some complications with my insurance, however, Dr.Golie, Dr.Gupta and the staff went beyond their limits to help me and actually did a very nice thing for me that they were not obligated to do. I'm not one to write reviews on yelp for any locations that I visit, I'm more so into reading others reviews and keeping it at that. BUT that being said, this place deserves a review with how well they treated me. Definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking a good eye clinic.

First I went and I always get dysport it works better for me well she didn't wanna open a new vile because she was going on vaca so she asked did I'd get botox. Sure , NP I really like her so I was like whatever well I got a lot less botox for the price and had no results what so ever maybe a little but hardly. I also get this done because I have horrible migraines and it always worked this time it didn't.The next time I went for filler in my eye lines and my smile lines I got a full syringe and the first two days were great when I was swollen than nothing its like I never got anything done I was so upset I spent 550$ for no result at all.I've gotten this done plenty of times before so I know it wasn't me with the same amount out in.Well that was the second strike close to 800$ \u00a0I was beyond unsatisfied I was crying because I was making videos and had to look my best that's why I went for my touch up.She usually did a great job that's why is suprised me.I called to explain and the receptionist which by the way is the rudest most unprofessional person I have met. She has talked down to me and my husband like we were beneath her. I mean helloo we spent thousands at your spa and are loyal customers. I have a pretty big following on my social media I gave them free advertising saying how they were the best etc. I was loyal. I got fed up after my filled didn't work and my botox didn't work and to top it off I talked to Catalina or whoever is the main girl I called so many times left messages no one called back for days I wanted to speak to the doctor not her she didn't know what she was talking about I even heard her make fun of me with her friend I speak polish too I understand what you say. She even accused me of being late and went off on my husband when I was in their bathroom taking my makeup off. This was the final straw when she accused me and my husband of fraud my husband and his father own a huge furniture franchise and they use company cards well someone got ahold of their number and spent over 5 grand on items that were not authorized. So the secretary called all the places because she did not know. It took week to figure out what was legit and what wasn't we even had to sign an avidavid.We made sure we paid them the money even though I never got any results so it was money down the drain. The excuse of oh it works different on everyone is be because I've gotten it done plenty of times at this place and never had it not worked. I still had the same lines basically like I got nothing done. I'm hurt and disappointed . I would have fired that girl along time ago that is not how you treat customers .I never got offered to have it fixed I never got my 50$ voucher for my yelp and I gave them free publicity to over 15,000 people. I don't think the doctor knew about this and they didn't say anything because I had a n appointment to come back and I needed it because I was filming in a couple days. I made it that same day I got my fillers nope they forgot and I got screwed. I was tired of getting treated horribly by the receptionists and one of the estiticians which I know were being sarcastic and rude .I wish she would ditch her staff because she is amazing. I let so much slide but after being accused of stuff even though they got paid is bs the fact that they didn't redo my filler is bs 550$ is not cheap to not get results. It sucks because I love the doc I always had good results except the past two times I can't afford to keep going back and not being satisfied especially with the service. I wish the doctor knew how her staff treats people because she probably wouldn't be too happy. I would go because she dies great work if you can stand snobby receptionists. I really feel I still deserve what I paid for and wish I spoke with the doctor herself because I'm pretty sure they never told her.", "rating": "2", "date": [2016, 2, 3]}, "9": {"description": "I bought a Groupon for this place years ago, and since it was a bit far from where I live I ended up trying out a bunch of places closer to Wicker Park where I live over the past few years. I never forgot about my amazing experience there however and so I looked them up and they had another groupon running for a Gold Facial. I bought that and added two other spa treatments at the same time, and it was even better than I remember. Monika is so amazing, patient, and asks you really in depth questions about your skin and what you want to achieve, your skin care regimen, and gives you some good advice on how to care for your skin without being pushy about products etc. While the enzyme part of the facial was on my face, I got a full hand and forearm massage which I didn't expect, and it was so relaxing and lovely. The facial itself left my skin luminous.. seriously i woke up today and I am glowing. I'm done buying Groupons for different places at this point, I will ONLY go to Monika. The ambience of the place is tranquil and comfortable even if the area the spa is in is a bit lacking in charm. The rooms were the perfect temperature, and there was music pumped into each room which made it much more spa like than just a treatment facility. Everyone was nice and my facial started right on time and went the full amount of time. HIGHLY recommend... and I'm not sure what the other people on here are talking about that gave bad reviews.

I was not relaxed at all. Apparently their Gold Infusion Facial includes, wash, exfoliate, mask, moisturize. For their regular price...this is completely not worth it. Maybe because I used a Groupon, I was not treated as well as a full price payer is.Besides the facial itself, the music was not conducive towards any type of relaxation, the lights were extremely bright, and I could hear the receptionist, doorbell, basically everything. In addition, the aesthitician was extremely loud slamming cabinet doors while getting product out.

I wish to be served. \u00a0There is a reason they have strayed away from the 31 flavors branding, because they have maybe 16 now. \u00a0Half of which are empty, or at least the ones I want. \u00a0If there is any justice in the world the roof will collapse on this place.. but don't worry, nothing will be lost... all the machines are already broke and the ice cream is already empty. \u00a0With all that said the Dunkin Donuts part of the store runs more effectively, as I believe way more people patron that side of the business.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 3, 13]}, "10": {"description": "If I could give this place zero stars I would.

That is, create a tasty beef patty and awesome fries. Although not life-altering-experience good, I feel that Leadbelly does succeed in both these areas. In general, the beef patties are tasty with a good level of seasoning and have a nice hearty size to them. The smoked pork belly that is mixed in with the ground beef does add a memorable flavor to the patty although I wish that the patty itself was a bit more juicy. The homemade items really do shine through, from the tasty sauces to the fluffy buns. This gives each item a fresh taste and unique flavors.One thing I really liked about all the burgers I tried was that the beef patty was clearly the theme ingredient. The other elements of the burger like the smoked bacon and bourbon bbq sauce in the Easy Rider or Goat Cheese and Truffle Aoili in Old Time Religion helped to bring out the flavor of the meat rather than overpower it. This can really only happen when you have faith in the quality of your ingredients and do not need to use seasoning and sauces to mask poor quality meat. I really enjoyed the clear difference in presentation, colors, shape, and flavors of each of the burgers I tried. From the other items I saw on the menu, I really appreciate the variety of interesting flavor combinations they offer, without being extremely pricey for a similar burger elsewhere.I enjoyed the fries quite a bit here. Generously sized, slightly soft but with nice crispy edges and a thicker cut with some skin. What I really like about this was also the toppings and seasoning didn't mask the strong potato flavor present in the fries. In particular, the garlic parm fries had a nice subtle garlic and parmesean flavor without feeling greasy or too salty. The chipotle fries weren't too spicy and gave a nice contrast of textures with the chili cheese fritos that were topped with a chipotle cream sauce.The Leadbelly butter cookie is a delicious mix of crushed pecans, white chocolate, milk chocolate with good strong flavor of egg and butter clearly present in the cookie. Perfect way to end the meal.Leadbelly is a great way to get creative burgers that you'll find at some of the better known spots in the city for a cheaper price and without the long wait.

BURGER! EVER! WOW...I am still thinking about Leadbelly and I ate here a week ago, but it feels like FOREVER! I don't even know where to begin! I'm getting a little giddy just thinking about this place! :) I'll start by saying their burger patty is not your traditional beef patty! It is WAY better...it has pork in it! The addition of pork adds wonderful flavor to the burger! You don't even need fancy toppings to enjoy it! The bun is unreal too! They bake them fresh everyday! They have a good selection of burgers that offer a variety of toppings...something suitable for various palettes! I decided to go with the original Leadbelly which has cheese, LTO, and homemade sriracha pickles. Sounds boring, I know....but the taste was AMAZING!!!! Like I said, the burger patty is tasty and doesn't need a whole lot to satisfy you. It's also made to order. I ordered mine well done and it was cooked perfectly -not burnt and dry! I can't imagine what would happen to my taste buds if I had one of the specialty burgers! :) A party in my mouth...I think so! My husband ordered the Amazing Grace which had smoked pork belly, crispy onions, sriracha pickles, and this Carolina BBQ mustard! It looks amazing and I know he enjoyed it! For a side, we split the chipotle fries....SO GOOD! It had a chipotle cream sauce, pico de gallo, and chili cheese fritos on top! Your burger also comes w/ a cookie...so exciting and so yummy! :) To wash your meal down, they have a variety of options. They have an amazing craft beer selection. They also have regular and \"adult\" shakes! Wow! We were conservative and just had water...haha. Definitely want to try a shake next time and the Old Time Religion burger which has goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomato, and truffle aioli! I LOVE that this place is not in the heart of the city or in a congested area where it takes you an hour to find parking. Leadbelly is in a strip mall and there is a parking lot. The ambiance is cool...good music and videos playing. It's not too loud where you can't have a conversation. It's clean and the staff is friendly! A little note: I couldn't finish my burger and wouldn't dare throw it away. The next day, I heated up my 1/4 of a burger that was left and it was STILL super tasty! And I was SO sad that I only had 1/4 left! :) That means...it is GOOD! I HIGHLY recommend Leadbelly. I don't think you will be disappointed!

To be honest, I was going to write a bad review until I looked into the mirror when I got home. First off, they only accept cash unless it's $30 or over. I am glad I called beforehand because I almost never have cash on me. Haircuts are $15 for women, plus $2 extra if you want a wash. I haven't had a haircut this cheap in a while (they usually end badly for me) but I am tired of paying $45+ for mediocre haircuts. When I arrived, I didn't request anyone specific since I've never been here before. I was also able to park right in front (street parking) for free, which is always a plus.The woman I met with (who shall remain unnamed) looked pretty disgruntled and didn't say much. After letting my hair loose from a clip to show my hair length (mid-back), she asks if I want a wash. It has hands down, the most aggressive shampooing I've ever had in my life. It was like I had mud in my scalp or something, and she was frantically trying to give it all off within 60 secs. It wasn't painful, just a lot of rapid scratching and LOTS of pressure. I mean, I had shampoo foam all over my forehead creeping into my eyebrows and sopping in both ears. At this point, I was regretting that I came here. Also, a wash is just shampoo, no conditioner.We went back to her chair and she started cutting. She didn't say one word to me the whole time, which is fine because I am not much of a talker, but she just looked like her hated her job. It was super weird. You don't have to talk to me, but please don't look like you're taking out your frustration on my hair. She also had all her fingernails cut except the thumb, which had a french manicure on it but was badly chipped. When I say chipped, I mean the nail itself, not the nail polish. This is important because she was pretty aggressive with the haircut and kept scratching my face with that super sharp nail. When she finished, she waved the blow dryer through my hair to get some of the moisture out of it. She put a mirror in front of me so that I could see the back. Because she didn't comb it or anything, I still had hair all over my face. It's the way you would look after driving down a highway with your windows open. It did not look good.I tipped her $5 (and found out that this woman was capable of somewhat smiling) and paid the $17 at the front desk. I got in my car and immediately starting fussing about why I never go to places like this. I kept fingering through my hair to comb it while I drove, fix my part line, etc. I arrived home to look in the mirror to see what the damage was, and by now my hair is completely dry. Surprisingly, it looked good. So the positives being 1) the haircut actually looked nice, 2) the haircut was cheap, 3) parking is free, and 4) location isn't too far from home. I don't need the \"experience\" to be pampering, but I think I'll ask for another stylist next time.

First of all, I have been a patient of doctor Szewczyk for many years and have to admit that the quality of care is just outstanding. Doctor Szewczyk is never rushed and takes a holistic care of her patients. Few times, thank to her detailed tests (and advanced technology she is using), doctor identified several health issues that were outside of her area of expertise and I will always be thankful for that. I feel good that every time I have my annual check-up I see some new & best in class technology that is being used to examine my eyes condition and health - this means to me that I am at the right place since the care is evolving and I want my doctors to follow new technologies/research/innovations. Lastly, I only purchased two pairs of frames (in 8 years) and they last forever! I am still using both to work and continue to receive many compliments (the person that works at IFEC spent hours to help me find perfect frames, was patient and never rushed me, even recommended I come back in few weeks to get the perfect style and I got it!... so I don't have a need to change frames for a \"better model\").

It's large, warm & welcoming, well-lit and not too noisy.SERVICE: Brisk, but cordial and helpful. Our servers were attentive & knowledgeable. Food delivery was well-paced. We were not rushed. There are plenty of staff and service seems to run very smoothly.GOOD: We liked the ribs, a house specialty. They are not the deep, smoky ribs (a la Smoque), but are well-cooked, well-trimmed and tender. Our half-slab orders each came with a commendably fresh salad and a side.NOT SO GOOD: While my grilled veggie side was OK, my companion's twice-baked potato was dry & dull.I'll probably return when I'm in the neighborhood for a play again.

The store was poorly stocked looked over run from the holiday weekend and understaffed. I went to load the car my wife went for the steaks. When she returned to the car my 20.00$$$ steak was wrapped in plastic.... PLASTIC on a hot steak.... you sir should lose your job clearly are on drug have no business handling food. Warning heated plastic contains BPA and causes cancer something I shouldn't have to worry about ...Because I don't like being poisoned. Irrational, angry, frustrated, pissed off and hungry I storm into Mariano looked right at the first Manger I saw and said WTF is this \u00a0(sorry Alex)... she said I don't know sir did u just get that it's not right. I went on my cancer and rant. She continued to calm me and assure me that this will be taken care of. Ass we walked into the meat section. Dip stick was on the phone. She told him to get off the phone and he continued to send the message then finally \u00a0acknowledged the fact that someone was pissed.

While the setup is a bit labyrinthine, and it being noon on a Sunday, extremely crowded, I know I'll be back. (Maybe on a weeknight or way earlier in the day). \u00a0The produce section was very large with plenty of organics represented. The prices were decent, a bit higher than my local produce store,but had more selection. One thing to note, for SOME items the price is per piece of fruit, others are per pound. Pay attention!As far as the package goods and frozen goods go, the selection is a bit better than say, Jewel, and priced a bit higher. If you are into Gluten free, organic, etc. the prices are higher and not as good a selection as Whole foods. The meat section is pretty good, with prices comparable to WFs. The meat looked pretty spectacular. \u00a0Fish seemed expensive.Prices in the deli seemed higher than Jewel, not as high as WF. I didn't wait around for lunchmeat today, so couldn't speak to the speed.The flower section seemed pretty amazing, with good prices, as were the liquor aisles. \u00a0The food court, bakery and cheese section were pretty spectactular, but I avoided them today. If I need to grab some munchies for a party and don't have time to cook em myself, this looks like the place to go!I think what totally capped of the experience was that when we left, there was a guy playing piano at the end of the check out lines.

So I get home and I am taking a look at the menu I was handed. No where would this equal that much. I talked to some girl on the phone who tried explaining pineapple is more, it's two toppings. How on EARTH is that two toppings?!? If anything meat should be more pineapple is cheap. News flash your menu says two toppings for a 14\" is15.05 NOT 17.55. So, the manager gets on the phone and says its a speciality topping and it's more money. He also said that the menus are out to date so he's waiting for them on order. You can't charge people new prices that don't even exist yet. He said he would credit my account for next time $2.00. No thanks, we won't be coming back.

Not just double booked - this place was quadruple booked. Never a good sign.When the doctor finally came in, she was rushed, rude & talked over top of me while supposedly (again) taking my medical history.

It was positively bizarre,When I suggested that maybe we were having a communication problem she decided that I was 'insulting' her - and I honestly was not - she did speak English fairly well, but it seemed like perhaps she couldn't understand what I was saying as she was attacking & misinterpreting every single answer I gave. \u00a0Tho honestly - I am not sure how she could really hear anything I was saying as she was typing away, looking at her computer screen - and was very hurried, annoyed, busy, talking over me - steamrolling over everything I was saying - and then scoffing at everything I said. It was exhausting, frustrating & frightening - She had me in tears, shaking and almost in crisis right there in the exam room after her \"doctoring\".. which frankly wouldn't have passed muster in a prison camp! and the exam?

It is definitely very dated. It's not really a \"Dive\" diner, but some may refer to it as a \"hole in the wall.\" In fact, I am a preterist, so I absolutely loved this about the restaurant. It is very compact. The service is exceptional and somewhat effusive. The restaurant is on the west side of Elston Ave. \u00a0We left fully satisfied, and our check was under $20 (excluding tip). \u00a0Take your check and walk up to the register and pay. Remember the theme song from \"CHEERS\"?? Well, they knew our names by the time we left here.....\"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your nameAnd they're always glad you cameYou wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the sameYou wanna be where everybody knows your nameBe glad, there's one place in the worldWhere everybody knows your name and they're always glad you cameYou want to go where people know, people are all the sameYou want to go where everybody knows your name\" Yeah, this song pretty much sums up what the Yellow Rose is all about. My 4-star rating is due to the fact that this joint is CASH ONLY and their parking lot is the size of a postage stamp! We would return again if we are ever in this area. The Owners have warm hearts who truly care for their customers. They use quality ingredients (fresh, not frozen) and serve up delectable food. Request their home-made jam or jelly for your toast. Skip the prepackaged Smucker's jelly. They treat every customer with R-E-S-P-E-C-T which was evident from the moment we entered to the moment we paid and left. Service alone receives 5-stars!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 3, 2]}, "47": {"description": "CASH ONLY!

Recently moved to the north side and came across Tuxpan Mexican Grill. I saw the reviews and 4-5 stars gave me the green light to order.Skimming through the menu the American Burger section should have given me the red flag but I wanted to see what the 5 star fuss was about. Everything on the menu seemed to sound delicious So i ordered a torta dinner (milanesa/breaded steak) and 1 gordita de chicharron (pork groin green sauce). Taco dinner , 2 chicken tacos.They told me 30-40 minutes , seeing as how i was half a mile away from them it seemed fine. 1 hour and 20 minutes later my food was here. As i suspected my food was cold/slightly warm.My tortillas were soggy as well as my bread. The food in general is 1 star 2 at best. I wasnt expecting authentic 100% mexican food but with the \u00a0items that were on the menu i would have thought they would come somewhat close since alot of the items take time to make and need a little more then basic cooking knowledge.The beans were salty, the rice was actually fine but was dry. The milanesa was breaded but I was more worried about the amount they had given me. I was basically eating more bread then meat. I opened my torta up and it seemed instead of giving me the whole breaded steak they just gave me half of it. The breading seemed to taste like corn dog breading.The 2 chicken tacos had no seasoning what so ever. Taste broiled. The lettuce was already browning. The salsa they give you is basically tomato sauce with salt. The best tasting thing i received from my order was the Sangria. And that came extremely warm as well. I give this a 1 star and would not recommend this to anyone else that is looking for an authentic taste. It may be that since I come from a Mexican background that i know a little bit of what something should taste like, but for a restaurant like this to have 4-5 stars it seems to be kinda untrue on the quality.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 6, 3]}, "56": {"description": "so since my last review I've continue to order from Tuxpan and I have to say that my rating has gone up since then.I'd have to say that they are probably the best tacos in Chicago.

If you like Polish cuisine or anything about Polish culture, you are required by the laws of common sense to strike Taste of Polonia.Taste of Polonia features Polish folk dancing, Okocim, latkes, meatballs, kielbasa, sauertkraut, and all things Polish. The Polish people far outnumber the random Chicago drunks more prevalent at Lincoln Square Mayfest or Oktoberfest so they can handle their liquor much better. Last year I ran into an old man who was completely wasted carrying the largest sack of money I've seen this side of the Pacific Ocean. He also said he had a gun, and 99% of the time someone telling you they have a gun would frighten you, but I laughed hysterically.Every year at Taste of Polonia they set up huge tables so you can sit down, there are places to stand and drink/eat Mayfest-style with giant umbrellas so you don't get sunstroke and they always bring in loads of bands that play great music to go with your Okocim and Polish food.The latkes are where it's at, but I sweat all of the other food too.

Tonight was my first time getting my T.O.P. cherry popped and it was pretty good. The fest was crowded but family friendly. They charged $7 for admission into the fest. Food, bouncy house, prize games are not included in the fee and run from $5 - $12 each. There were several other games hosted by sponsoring companies that offered opportunities to win little prizes for free (ex. Stickers, pencils, glow sticks, etc). The music was pretty good. There were 3 stages...one had an American band performing top 40 hits, another stage with a Polish rock band, the last stage had a dj. There were several food stands. Make sure you buy your tickets because the vendors do not accept cash. Each ticket is $1, a sheet is $20 (20 tickets). I got the polish platter and for $12, which consists of 3 pierogis, potato pancake,polish sausage, sauerkrate, stuffed cabbage, sour cream, and apple sauce. I enjoyed the char-grilled sausage it was just perfect. The piergoi was pretty good. I felt everything else lacked flavor. My family loved it though, I guess it depends on the person The crowd was majority Polish (duh). There were a handful of different ethnicities, but everyone was there for the same reason, to have fun. I felt comfortable overall. My only complaint was that there were plenty of smokers, which sucks because I'm allergic to cigarette smoke. I guess the ordinance doesn't apply to outdoor fest.Parking is near to impossible. They offered free parking at Hoyne Bank, which was at capacity. The best bet is to find street parking along Jefferson Park. There was additional parking at the lot next to the train station for $12. The center itself had a classical concert. It was filled so I didn't stay, not that I intended to.

What I discovered is that the food is only one part, a small one, of the overall fest. This year is ToP's 30th Anniversary. The festival is hosted in the area surrounding the Copernicus Center. The Center, originally the Gateway Theater, was built in 1930 and was the first movie theater in Chicago built exclusively for the \"talkies\" and becoming home to the Polish Cultural Center in 1979. The festival runs all through Labor Day weekend (Monday too) and has five stages - two for music, one for dance music (mostly polka), one for kids, and multi-purpose stage inside the Center. Many of the bands are cover bands with Polish roots, like the reggae band Rebel Roots. There are many booths selling everything from cheesy Polish tchotchkes like t-shirts that say \"stop staring at my pierogies,\" to sunglasses, to jewelry. Inside the Center they had a casino, various acts on the stage, and a bar; outside they also had some carnival games. I had a good time, the people watching alone is priceless. The stages had plenty of seating making it easy to eat or just take a load off. They were also pretty generous with the length of sets, each act got approximately 2 hours to perform! The beer tent offered a souvenir mug option and discounted refills too. The only reason I'm giving this fest 3.5 stars is: * No Okocim beer, it's like the Miller of Polish beers. * Tickets required for food and drinks are only sold in $5 increments, but food/drink isn't priced in $5 increments. I felt like a drug dealer helping an old lady out by trading $2 in tickets for cash. * Food choices, I was expecting more of a variety of vendors. Aside from Kasia's there was one other Polish food vendor. Maybe Pierogi Fest spoiled me. * PolTel's goose mascot creeped me out. They had multiple people dressed as them milling through the Taste. ToP is convenient to public transportation, the Blue line and Metra's Jefferson Park stop is just steps from the fest and the Milwaukee bus will drop you right there too.

Each time I walked by Jefferson Park Grill I etched into my mind that I'd eventually venture forth through that door, chatting up the patrons and possibly getting into a fight.One day after work, the time was ripe since I got off earlier. I came in around 7:00 waving to the lady smoking on the steps outside, we shared a momentary smile. As I walked in I noticed it was small, quaint space, maybe 1-2 people working the kitchen, but the cashier was nowhere to be found. I hear an \"excuse me baby\" and as I step aside the woman that was smoking on the steps passes by and hops up to the cash register to my surprise. Looking at the menu I got hungry for a good Philly cheese steak and a pizza puff with some OJ. The cashier was nice and worked it so that she replaced the drink that came with my pizza puff combo with the higher priced OJ without charging me extra for the OJ. She then asked me where I was going to sit and brought me my juice. I took the time to look around while I was there. There are a few wooden tables, a tv, atm, with some pictures on the wall of celebrities that I assumed visited before. The place was clean as a whistle and the only customers inside were me and another guy (who was also dressed in a suit like myself which prompted some glaring.)After waiting around 10 minutes she brought my sandwich, fries and pizza puff. To my delight this Philly steak looked freaking amazing with perfectly melted cheese blended with peppers and nicely toasted bread. It's almost as if they prepared it for a commercial shoot. The pizza puff made me ecstatic as well since it's not your typical crappy frozen puff you get at most restaurants. The puff they serve is full of meat, cheese, sauce, and bigger than the usual ones along with being cooked perfectly as well. Everything tasted great. The Philly disappointed me a bit because they didn't prepare it like a usual Philly (no mayo or anything extra, just cheese and peppers.) So it didn't have that unique Philly taste. The cashier stopped by frequently checking in and making sure everything was good with me, even bringing me ketchup and telling me I was the best dressed customer she'd ever seen (which prompted the other guy to leave in what I can only assume was a fit of jealousy.)The cook stepped out for a bit and went outside the back door to wash a bucket. Meanwhile the cashier opened the bathroom door to find a half naked crackhead doing god knows what inside there. He came out a few minutes later, starting chatting and causing a small scene with all his twitching and barely intelligible speech while trying to order a sandwich that wasn't even on the menu. Eventually he settled on an egg and sausage sandwich coupled with a coffee before he made his way to Jefferson Park station to beg for money. Fun times.Overall a good place to visit. I'd say expect a good presentation and not your usual spin on things. Good food, great prices. Don't settle for Dunkin Donuts, Mcdonalds, etc. when you can visit this place.*This place is CASH ONLY.

So the way they make Sisig or even Bistec Tagalog or even the Classic Adobo may be different then what you are used to or even what you are expecting.

It's a Philippine stew flavored with peanut butter, they serve it with fork tender beef, boy choy, green beans, and eggplant. I know it sounds weird but I promise you, it is outrageously delicious. Kare kare can easily be messed up if you make it more like a soupy consistency and I am glad they made sure that the stew was thick and super flavorful.

I've been begging my parents to just simply live forever, so I can have monggo, dinuguan, and sinigang at request. We regularly pick up from nearby Filipino marts for dinner, and to pack leftovers for our \"baon\" in the morning. But to find a nearby restaurant?! oh, this was heaven.Grazing the money with my starving eyes, every item, save for one, seemed familiar. I was salivating and marinating in dreams of planning a trip for every meal, for every day of the week. bicol express. pancit bihon. cassava cake. adobo. sisig. sinigang. kare kare. kaldereta. EHRMAGERRRRD!!!For one fleeting moment, I thought, \"maybe i can finally skip out on socializing at Filipino parties!... cuz let's face it. I'm really only there for the food, and not for the 'so who is your boyfriend?' jokes, and prying eyes, and the glares at my empty ring finger.\" \u00a0i really only commit to my Filipino roots to feed my Filipino-food-fed-soul. Aside from that, I'm really a nomad. I was in love. I was in love with the dreams of breakfast. Sweet meats. garlic fried rice. and fluffy fried eggs. pancit in all forms. bihon, canton, and bihon/canton. i love me some mulatto pancit. i'm all about the pancit, one love. \u00a0desserts included halo halo, cassava cake, and some others. lumpia shanghai. i mean... lumpia shanghai?!?!! \u00a0*sigh* and then I woke up.my origins with food are the very reason why i'll never be American-skinny. i'll forever be more-to-love.i digress. we dined, in merely for breakfast. I had the combo of tocino with longanisa, over garlic fried rice, married with two fluffballs of fried egg. my sister got the tapsilog, and a side of tocino. My meat was tasty. slight on salt, leaned more sweet, and heavy hand with the fatty. All the makings of good filipino breakfast, and every reason why my cholesterol should always be monitored closely. It was tasty, with just a slight bit of char on the longanisa . my tocino was sweet, had hints of sour vinegar, and could have been a slight bit more juicy, but its integrity was kept by the layers of fat that snuggled the meat with love. \u00a0My sister's tapsilog was drier than I liked, with good flavor, but every chew had this small sinister whisper of \"beefsteak\" in my mind... my palate looked for onions that weren't there. My mouth was having tapsilog, while my heart wanted bistec.The food overall? good. fairly priced.Now service. oooooh, the service. The cook was friendly, but the server, linda, was not quite to my liking. There were a few instances of uncomfortable hovering. We were given menus. After a minute, she asked our order, and we needed more time. She left to play on her phone, and never came back until we waved her down. We asked for boxes for our leftover, and she left us for her phone again, not anticipating we would also be ready for our bill. My sister had gotten coconut juice, served in a can. My sister got hers... no acknowledgement of my calamansi \u00a0juice (and oh, i'd recommend that for anyone who wants to indulge in a little filipino lemonade kinda lovin).

Sisig is not the style I was hoping for (like the crunchy sizzling with egg on top). It has mayonnaise and was too fatty rather than crispy. Meals are a little pricey for the amount of food.

We went in, the staff was very nice. It looked very clean and we hoped for the best. Now I'm a stickler when it comes to Filipino food being a foodie who married into a large Filipino family who cooks up a storm, so I had high expectations. We started with the lumpia which was pretty good. We then ordered a plate of pansit and the sisig. It took a little while which I totally understand but when it came out it immediately gave off the scent of a dirty dog or possibly rotting flesh.(which I can only compare it to for lack of ever smelling it before). My wife's immediate reaction was to cover her nose and whisper to me, \"Oh no... They used fish sauce...\". So this wasn't my first time dealing with fish sauce but it WAS the first time it made me gag uncontrollably. I didn't want to be disrespectful so I tried a bite. We both took one to two bites respectfully and pushed it aside as far as possible so as not to smell it anymore. Next they brought us the wrong dish, no biggy, in fact I wish we would have kept that one.... The sisig came out Luke warm, in a very sour sort of cream sauce. It was ALL fat. Barely any crispy skin and like I had previously mentioned, it was freaking room temperature. Well once again we decided let's not judge by looks or smell and gave a few bites... Let's just say we pushed it aside as well within a minute. We ended the night on a slightly higher note with a decent Halo Halo but it was hard to eat with that fishy aftertaste still ruining my taste buds from earlier. I usually don't write bad reviews at all but I feel like something has to be said when your wife goes home and throws up what she just ate immediately... Beware.

Hes pretty much the only white guy review (aside from mine) and the only 1 star review out of 6 other high reviews by Philippine natives. So whose right, the one white guy or the 5 other filipinos? He is one of my own but also the type of \"kano\" I am most embarrassed by. You know the ones who think just because they are married to a Filipina they suddenly become the self appointed smarter American expert on everything Filipinos do. Including but not limited to, how Filipino food should be prepared, look, smell and taste. When he went on talking about the sisig 's \"crispy skin\" I know what all the Filipinos where thinking; \"He's describing lechon not sisig\" right? Right! Jose should know that sisig is the one that comes on the hot sizzling plate and can often be even more appetizing with an egg over the top. There is nothing crispy about sisig because u usually cover it with some \"calamansi\". It's hot and steamy never crispy. Perhaps he ordered crispy pata? Perhaps his Filipina wife and her entire family have been cooking it wrong? I've been traveling to the Philippines since age 21 and I'm 40 now. I lived there for over two years. I know more about Filipino food then Jose will in the next three lifetimes. The food here is far from what Jose had tried to lead you all to beleieve. I know the owners have also tried making things right with Jose because I as a first time visitor suggested they keep their yelp ratings high. Being that his review is still here 4 days later, I cannot help but think Jose's distasteful review is nothing more than the inner workings of a competitor trying to slow them down. I met Linda and probably Linda's mom who help bring items to our table. Our water glasses never ran empty. Dirty dishes were immediately removed from the table. They were all attentive, friendly and never overbearing. The beef steak was out of this world. The porksilog was good too. My girlfriend of 5 years, also a Filipina thought the porksilog was a \"little\" on the dry side. All I had to do was whisper it to Linda and she immediately said she would not charge for it. Businesses will make mistakes no matter what. What is important is their willingness to fix them as quickly as they occur and in this case they did the right thing! Therefore, they've earned my 5 stars! I was impressed to hear her son had immediately replied to Jose's yelp review. When Jose spends a day in your kitchen with his wife and their whole family learning how real Filipino food is cooked. I'll rewrite my review. If they don't like the smell of dogs they should stay away from tuyo and use better foot scrubs. If they do like dogs, my advice to Jose's wife would be to keep your dog on a leash. She should explain to her know it all husband what \"kababayan\" means and the unspoken \u00a0respect it comes with. The type that should have made them think twice before leaving such a tasteless review on a brand new establishment. If there is one thing Jose was telling the truth about I'm sure it was that he married a Filipina. How do I know? While I love the Philippines and all its people, they both perfectly demonstrated the most horrible trait of that territory. That is, instead of her and her husband having had the courage to mention these things to their face while they were there. They instead chose to go home and blast them online after they left. Back stabbing traits typical of the filipina. Correction, the spoiled american filipina type who thinks shes snarter and better than the other pinays. If my girlfriebd would have put her hand over her nose, I would have been imbarrased by my girlfriend not the smell. Being that their one star review had little or no bearing on their overall rating. The next time i see the fine folks at Kawayan I will encourage them to let Joses review stay. As will mine. All is fair in love and war. I'm sure this place will carry on fine. PS. I'm former Manager of the Year for Hilton Hotels. Not one of them all of them in the state of Illinois. I also own my own consulting company since age 21. I know customer service when I see it.

So upon this visit, I just made mention to the present clerk, that I wore my school ID, just to be on the safe side; for my few pennies discount, (which do add up - I spend out-of-pcket/MY pocket, on the average $1k per year on my students in supplies and food - yes, I feed my dears - so I appreciate discounts)....And he said, \"Yes, I heard about that...\" Now, I'm thinking the incident was about three months ago - near the end of school. This young man looks new to me, so he must have been trained in the art of SERVICE and KINDNESS and THOUGHTFULNESS!, because my \"incident\" must have been used as an example of \"what never to do to a teacher who spends her money on her students\", (Art teachers are crazy, I mean special - you know).Thank you American Science... I must organize a field trip one day to American Science - or perhaps a virtual tour...", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 8, 25]}, "36": {"description": "Awesome place! Science nerds, aspiring engineers, science teachers, and others who just like \"stuff\" enjoy this quirky, unusual store. A good place to purchase little empty bottles, lava lamps, geodes, telescopes, little rubber pigs, ammo cases, marbles, wire, beakers, cammo band-aides...you get the picture! My husband and I have been enjoying this store for years.
