When I sat in Jen's chair, she asked me what I wanted to accomplish. \u00a0I said I wanted to remove the brassiness, add shine and asked if there was a way to color my hair so when the highlights started growing out I wouldn't have obvious roots. She said \"Absolutely.\" \u00a0 She also explained the dryness in my hair was due to my hair cuticles being opened by the highlighting, but not sealed or closed with a toner or color.She brought out the color swatch book (BG had a lot more color options than Mera) and suggested both high & low lights that would accentuate the red/gold highlights in my brown hair while adding a base of my natural color to eliminate the root issue as well as add shine. \u00a0There was no chemical smell or tingling that happens sometimes with highlights. \u00a0I am ESTATIC with the results! \u00a0Jen is an amazing colorist. I also got my eyelashes tinted - again natural products and I love the results - it took only 10 minutes and cost $15. \u00a0My lashes are darker and I look like I have on some eyeliner!

Place was super affordable at $35 for a wash and haircut. Didn't get a blow dry because it was so hot out.Eva was extremely nice, however my hair is a disaster! Left side is a perfect chin length bob with long layers. Right side is a long wedge. Uneven. Puffy. It's really bad. Should have waited to go to my girl downtown. You get what you pay for... I'd rather pay $100 for a haircut that always looks good, even 4 months after or wait. Will never go back.
