I went here as part of the pretty in pink promotion for a single process color and conditioning treatment. \u00a0Denise was the stylist. \u00a0After the deep conditioning treatment, Denise puts a towel on my head and hands me a comb. Hair dripping, in the middle of the store, I'm asked to comb my hair (and dry it). \u00a0I wasn't even led back to the styling station (another stylist was looking on so apparently this was normal). \u00a0I've NEVER been to a salon where I was asked to comb/style my hair regardless of if its a promotion or not. \u00a0I wasn't going to debate this so I gave Denise her comb back, and with my wet hair, paid up and left.When my hair finally dries, I realize my hair coloring is bad. \u00a0I now have black hair with bluish black ends (instead of my original dark brown hair.) To fix it I went to a different salon for a color correction. \u00a0It was explained to me that 1. the color was left on too long and 2. the color was not applied properly. \u00a0Since my hair is relaxed it is more porous, needing a shorter processing time. Also, my ends did not need the same amount of time/color than my roots since I had a previous single process color and this was a touch up (it was explained as color accumulation).Denise used a dark brown color, applying the color down to the ends in sections (instead of applying the color to the new growth first and leaving the ends for last). \u00a0She left the entire color on my hair for 25 minutes - never checking my hair to see how the color was taking. The result: black hair with even darker ends with a bluish tint. She knew my hair was relaxed and previously colored during the consultation but I was put in a one size fits all without any adjustments. WHY GO TO A PROFESSIONAL?After digesting the mistakes I called the manager, Noel. \u00a0She was receptive and apologetic. \u00a0She was sorry about the bad coloring and how I was treated. She said that combing is definitely included (what happened? Especially when none of the other stylists spoke up and just gave me blank looks?). Drying Is not included. \u00a0That's fine if that's how they want to run their salon. \u00a0I think drying is a common courtesy once they shampoo your hair and it allows you and the stylist to check the coloring results. But their decision to leave clients with wet hair is the least of their problems. \u00a0The BIGGEST problem is the lack of customer care - care in giving a profession job. \u00a0How can there be no adjustments for different hair types? How can you not care enough to check on the hair to see how the color is taking? \u00a0How can you have pride in your profession and ask a client to comb and style their own hair, sitting in a shampoo chair? \u00a0Denise did the bare minimum and a very BAD job at that. \u00a0As a layperson, I could have done a better job at home. \u00a0But that's not the point. \u00a0The work was lacking in care and it was the first time I felt offended when leaving a salon. The manager waived the fee for my service. I was offered the opportunity to come back. \u00a0But what's the point? As I said to her - thanks but no thanks. \u00a0p.s.

In what is looking more like \"Try New Mexican Restaurants Week\" for me, I thought I'd come in here at noon. I've been suspicious but curious about this restaurant for at least a year but never tried it.Well, it's not a seedy joint at all. Not crowded either despite the noon hour and people having lunch. Only one other person was ahead of me in line. A few more people came to pick up carry-out orders while I ate there.The place has some large paintings on the wall and an Aztec calendar. They appear to be big fans of President Obama, with 4 pictures of him on the wall, plus a pair of commemorative Obama plates, in addition to the mandatory Our Lady of Guadalupe image, which seems to be at almost every Mexican place I've visited.Of course, I had to do my benchmark steak burrito test on the place. I got a small table off to the side and the lady from the counter brought over a basket of chips and a squirt bottle of hot salsa. The salsa was perfect, just the right amount of flavor mixed with the right combination of hotness. And in what seemed to be no more than 2-3 minutes, my burrito was ready, along with a side of beans and rice. I also got a horchata for my drink.The serving size was excellent, contrary to the review by A.A. The burrito was cut in half but it was a manageable size and not skimpy either. If it could be any better, I'd add a bit more sour cream inside, but otherwise a stellar burrito, complemented well with the hot sauce. Beans were seasoned just right and the rice was fluffy and light, bright yellow in color. The horchata was good but a little more vanilla would put it over the top. The food is really good overall and a few minor things don't really make a big deal for me.

You can always count on an epic halloween theme. He doesn't just through some things up, he creates an in depth theme and experience for his store. He spends months planning and drawing and gathering materials to create this new world upon entering his store. The artwork inside is sublime and the themes always relate to every age. As for the icecream it's delicious. Super creamy, lots of exotic flavors. My favorite is the Haleys Comet which is a chocolate, vanilla swirl with caramel ribbon and rolos! There are more choices of cones than any other icecream place I've ever seen. There are waffle bowls, waffle cones, and sugar cones all covered in different combos of chocolate and toppings. My favorite are the Oreo sugar cones. It's like finally being able to choose a topping for a cone instead of having to get it in a cup! If you want to pick up an icecream cake for an event they also specialize in awesome decorations. Charlotte who makes all the cakes is a super talented artist who can match any idea. Currently I saw a super cute dinosaur cake and an Elsa from Frozen cake. They also have decadent cakes for any occasion with many different icecream fillings and crusts.

You can always count on an epic halloween theme. He doesn't just through some things up, he creates an in depth theme and experience for his store. He spends months planning and drawing and gathering materials to create this new world upon entering his store. The artwork inside is sublime and the themes always relate to every age. As for the icecream it's delicious. Super creamy, lots of exotic flavors. My favorite is the Haleys Comet which is a chocolate, vanilla swirl with caramel ribbon and rolos! There are more choices of cones than any other icecream place I've ever seen. There are waffle bowls, waffle cones, and sugar cones all covered in different combos of chocolate and toppings. My favorite are the Oreo sugar cones. It's like finally being able to choose a topping for a cone instead of having to get it in a cup! If you want to pick up an icecream cake for an event they also specialize in awesome decorations. Charlotte who makes all the cakes is a super talented artist who can match any idea. Currently I saw a super cute dinosaur cake and an Elsa from Frozen cake. They also have decadent cakes for any occasion with many different icecream fillings and crusts.

The whirlpool chair was alright the jets were not nearly as powerful as the ones I experienced last year, and the back massager would have been nicer if I knew what I was turning on all the control instructions were rubbed off. I sat in the whirlpool maybe 5 minutes before the tech started my treatment. My nails werre cut; fine, filed; NOT SO FINE !, buffed; ok, and cuticles clipped eeh, ok not great. She left the edges rough after filing and left spots of white cuticle growth on some of my toes. Last year at my first pedicure I was told by my tech and friend that I had ingrown toenails on both my big toes. I told my tech this today and she said \"oh no you dont there is nothing there\". Being that my toes are on my feet shouldn't I know if they are ingrown and causing me pain?!? The exfoliation another standard part of the pedicure was really bad. I have 2 callouses on my big toes and last year they were gently reduced. This year at this salon they were buffed only THEY ARE STILL ON MY FEET! SOMETHING THAT I PAID TO BE REMOVED AND TREATED IS STILL THERE. And what is supposed to be the best part of the pedicure the massage it was barely there most places go from the knee down well not here lower ankle down and it was over before I even knew about it. So tonight at home I will have to re-file and exfoliate my own feet!! I went with a friend and she got a regular manicure nothing fancy (my friend doesnt get acrylics or anything like that). Her nails were done by the same tech and her experience was quite similar. The tech was only going to file her nails when you could definately see they needed to be cut. AND THIS IS THE CHERRY ON TOP THE TECH ONLY MASSAGED ONE HAND!!!!! Thats right my friend walked out of there with half a hand massage!!! They offer SPA Manicures and Pedicures (FOR MORE MONEY!) so I wonder if the better exfoliation and grooming, and massage is offered for these. OVERALL BOTH ME AND MY FRIEND WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THE FRENCH MANICURE DAY SPA!!! THIS WAS PRETTY BAD AS I GET A PROFESSIONAL PEDICURE ONCE A YEAR AS A TREAT I COULD HAVE SAVED THE 36.00 (STUPIDLY GAVE A 3.00 TIP) AND GOTTEN A MUCH MUCH BETTER PEDICURE SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!

By the time I was finished with the appetizer I inquired about my order and the server acted a little surprised. After going to the back to check on my order she returned and said it would be done in a few minutes. My wife finished her meal. I asked again about my order and a different server came up to me and asked what I would like to order. After much confusion (and my wife speaks Vietnamese) I discovered they never placed my original order. Neither time. \u00a0We left.Today, we went again and the level of incompetent service reached new heights. My order arrived, but it was not what I had ordered. They then took it from my table and tried to discover who ordered it. \u00a0I did not see anyone accept it so I couldn't tell what happened. \u00a0They came and took my order again. This time, when it arrived it was in a to-go bag! \u00a0They took it back to put in a bowl... but they didn't return. My food disappeared somewhere between the table and the black hole which is their kitchen. I was frustrated and asked how long it would take them to make it again - but I will take it home. \u00a0They actually came back in 10 minutes with my order. As I was walking out I peeked in the bag because it didn't feel like it was a bowl of Pho. \u00a0It was a sandwich. The length of time it takes to get your order can also be very long. I have personally witnessed several tables, over multiple visits, simply get up and leave the restaurant. \u00a0My wife and I have also left after ordering because it was taking too long for the food to arrive.I am not saying I will never return.

Chris later overheard me kidding with S. about how she should have chocolate chip Mickey Mouse pancakes and surprised her with a side as a fun treat with her just-right scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. \u00a0My steak and eggs, potato nuggets and toast were pretty damned good too, steak precisely medium rare as requested.

Very agreeable. His kids are obviously working the counter, and while as teens they'd almost certainly rather do something else at the moment, you never get the feeling that you're being short-shrifted. They're more than adequate, they kick butt and take numbers. He has a cook or two working the grills and he either watches them plate the finished meals or he plates them himself. There is NO GREASE IN THE AIR. It's immaculately clean and a very fresh feeling environment.It's really the very best place to eat breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning.

Kelly is PHENOMENAL and great at what she does. I have had GREAT results with the IPL laser hair removal. My ONLY complaint is that this laser is broken more often than not. I am in the middle of a 12 month Groupon & 80% of my appointments have been cancelled due to the IPL laser being broken. Then the worst part is that there are rather large waiting lists to get appointments (no problem when you make them 6 weeks in advance but to get an immediate appt to make up for the cancelled appt is not easy) and because the appointments are 1hr appts for large areas, I generally don't get in until my next appt. I am assuming and hoping that they will extend my groupon due to being on a 12 month time limit & this week was my 4th cancelled appt since August (due to the IPL being broken). I have not yet asked about this so I cannot say yet, but I will write another review either way. Due to the large response to groupon, (I know the businesses don't make much from groupon) but I would wish that they would buy a new IPL machine rather than dealing with this one and having to continually cancel appointments. I will also add that due to the fact that I am not having regularly spaced 6-8 week appts on these areas, I am NOT having the good results that I was having with my face. In response to the other reviews I've been reading on here...most of them don't make sense to me. I've NEVER waited more than 5 minutes, I've never had a problem getting thru on the phone, I've ALWAYS gotten reminder calls (Dawn is great about that), and whoever said they were unprofessional I find hard to believe. Yes there is a wait to get an appt, but let me ask you this...when I call a salon and they can give me any date or time I want, I would wonder why..when a salon is good, it is hard to get an appt. Also to the ppl that were saying that they didn't have good results, it may be related to the hair color, skin color, etc, but you do need more than 6 months, it's not magic. I had a face full of hair (like a guy) and I did 2 years straight of laser here and it's about 90% gone!!! To get rid of it I would do 10 more years if I had to!

For me the laser hurt so bad (assuming cause it's the first time I've ever done anything like this) yet no results at all!.... What's the point?! I'm going through all this pain, traveling, and headaches for something that isn't working. Even though I was told I was a good candidate for laser removal. Yeah okay....3. Why are all your technicians always asking me (not sure if they pressure all clients) to add more places to get lasered like I'm chubakkha or something. I would like to see how my results are before you pressure me into adding more so that I'm ready for the summer time with all the areas I want lasered thanks. Good thing I didn't fall for this hoax! Since I got laser removal absolutely no results!!! And even after I asked the technician why there hasn't been any results she would always say the next few treatments should see more results....

Not medium rare! Sadly this has not happened to me just one, but 3 times. On the third time I decided to write my review. Please Wildwood Tavern, \u00a0you have the opportunity for great things, you just need to get a better cook. Don't over cook your meat and definitely don't over cook your eggs.

Other diners squeezed past to get to their tables all during our meal. Across from us, diners WITH reservations were vocally unhappy about their table but were not moved. Tables in the front of the restaurant remained available during our meal. Our table rocked, standard in cheap diners, unacceptable in a place with $16+ entrees. It's an easy fix: just sit down at your tables, restaurant owners, and lean on them. It would take just a few minutes.Water and a good firm bread arrive quickly. Wait staff grinds cheese for the bread, in very small portions that don't last if you plan on eating all the bread. You must ask for more cheese.

The entire front of the restaurant was wide open and yet the hostess had to go and check to see if we could be seated because we didn't have a reservation. And we noted that while we sat and ate there was one only one other table that filled. I asked for coffee and when they brought it was cold. Okay no big deal right? We placed our order which included one of my favorites lemon ricotta pancakes. When both entr\u00e9es were delivered to our table there was no butter or syrup for my pancakes or for the toast included in the my partner's entree. Also the toast arrived cold, hard, and dry. We wait to hail someone and wait. We finally decide to call over the hostess because she was closest to us and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0The hostess disappears and I continue to wait and wait for butter and syrup. Finally she comes from the back with a small pitcher of syrup and shards of butter slapped onto the same small plate used for the syrup. By now my pancakes are cold. Still no sign of our waiter. Finally our waiter appears and we explain our disappointment to him. He offers to bring more toast but so much time has passed we decline. He had never even bothered to stop and ask about our meal or even to inquire about reheating my coffee. Which I thought was standard procedure. \u00a0Then while the waiter is at our table my partner discovers a hair buried in his food. Shows it to the waiter and decides this is unacceptable and the waiter offers to bring a replacement. After such POOR service my partner declines the offer. \u00a0But never an apology. \u00a0As I'm still eating, we notice the young hostess outside at the front door with very large Starbucks drinks in her hands. Apparently she had left and now she can't open the door so mouths for my partner to come and let her in because we are the closest people. Really?? Your employee is allowed to bring in drinks from outside let alone have customers leave their table?! Then the waiter returns and offers us free tiramisu. \u00a0We declined.

Service was very warm and efficient. \u00a0The BAD:Food was very bland and lacking in bold flavor. Calamari was on the rubbery side and fried perhaps 3/4 of the way. \u00a0No salt, pepper.My bigger issue was Mia Figlia's red sauces were very bland and it is hard to love an Italian place whose marinara or meat gravy is weak. \u00a0Both Pizzas featured nice textured crusts but red sauces that required us to salt the top. \u00a0We asked for well done, and both seemed to barely melt cheese on top. \u00a0Perphaps it is the style of oven they use for these pizzetes. The Homemade Cheese Ravioli was just ok. Not enough Ricotta inside and red sauce is lacking.The Pancetta wrapped Pork Loin was very good all around. \u00a0Salads were priced well and respectable portion. Ingredients were quality. \u00a0But again, dressings were bland and lacking kick, giving salads \u00a0no distinctive flavor or personality.Im not going to make a beef on ambiance for these prices but surely they can give the dining room some personality with more interesting art, some plants, and colored paint.Also, it was cold. \u00a0Almost like thermostat was on 68/69, instead of 72.Overall, not a bad experience. They need to use more salt, garlic, and spice back there. Just not delivered a good enough experience to compel me to give them another shot.

But then again in the world of women's beauty, even if affordable nail salons are the equivalent of fast-food drive throughs in the restaurant market, we don't want to settle when it comes to how we look and feel. This lady included. That being said I enjoy going to Lee Nails and would recommend it. I shoot for the $35.00 mani pedi around these parts, and this place is slightly more costly, but they make up for it in other ways. Let me just share with you some things that might help you. I know nothing about fake nails, gels, fills, or any of that stuff. So I can't speak to that market. I haven't even yet ventured toward a no chip manicure. I'm a basic mani pedi girl, semi short soft squares. When it comes to nails, I'm all organic. (As if there is anything natural about it!) That being said, I've been getting my nails did all freakin' time for ten years, and I have frequented a respectable number of joints. Enough to know that this place is top notch. It's clean, and they have TVs, which I really like because trying to read those magazines is always annoying when your hands are beings soaked and held in rotation. I have never had to wait here, which is nice. And the one time that I did, one of the girls put me in a chair and ran the water and salts for me so I could soak while I waited. That of course made the delay a thousand times more tolerable. Also, this place is slightly annoying because although they take credit cards, they won't let you tip on your card. That's a cash only thing, and it was greatly flustering the first time I planned to pay with a card, asked if they took them, and then was paying just before the polish went on, and she told me cash only for a tip. With a dry bank account for a few days, I had to run to my parent's to grab ten bucks and go all the way back. So remember to bring enough cash for a tip! The last thing I want to mention is in reference to the eyebrow comments I saw. I have dark eyebrows and am particular about them. Over the years I have learned a couple things and one of them is never to get your brows done in a nail place like this unless you know exactly how they are going to turn out. Especially if you have dark hair and features, or rarely spend much time grooming your brows and are accustomed to that style. A quality brow design is only going to occur if you a) don't really care, b) knowingly want them thin, or c) if the person doing them is talking to you about them and what you want. That doesn't happen in nail salons like these. They should also be starting small and showing you as they groom. These ladies at most of these places are not trained stylists or estheticians. If I were to sit down in a chair and close my eyes and hope for the best, I personally think I'm a moron for being angry when I don't get what I want. And, finally, if you insist upon doing this, take a look at the girls brows doing it.

So, she cut them down real short and jagged. Then she did not bother to file them so that they were no longer jagged. She did not clean up my cuticles either. She proceeded to paint my nails but only in the center of my nail and completely avoided to paint the sides of my nail. I noticed that she was not painting the whole nail so I asked her to make sure to cover my whole nail with polish. So indeed she did. However not only did she get my whole nail she also painted the skin all around my nail. I brought to her attention then that she had painted all of my skin and that the ends of my nails were jagged and asked to file them straight. Seeing that I was not happy with the results she decided to repaint all of my nails. So instead of soaking off the polish she filed the polish off with an electrical metal round filer. Needless to say it was very painful and she files the tops of my nails down raw. She redid my nails and they did not look any better then the first time she did them. As a matter of fact they looked even worse! I told her I can not pay $30 for such a poor no-chip manicure. I asked her if she would pay $30 for the way my nails looked and she could not answer me. All she said was that my finger nails were too small. To small for what? To paint my nails? Are you kidding me! I told her as long as I have been getting my nails done no one has ever told me that my nails were too small to paint. Nor have I ever had such a horrific paint job. She told me to talk to the owner. So I did. I showed him my nails and he just shrugged his shoulders and had no solution for me. He blocked the door way as to keep me in the shop (as if I was going to run out or something) I told him. Listen, I will pay for my pedicure but I will not pay for the manicure. Not with the way they look. He told me that if I won't pay for the mani then the tech must take it off. I said that's fine, \"take it off then\".
