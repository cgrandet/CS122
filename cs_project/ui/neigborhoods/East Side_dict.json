Park the car next to the crumbling sidewalk with a 7 food pothole - it's time for a drink.Try and walk in - but the two front doors are locked. Just go around to the side door next to the half-torn down houses, garbage cans full of old clothes, and old marina on the Calumet River. Good, you finally found your way in - welcome to the 1950's. Your cell phone is temporarily out of service.It's poorly lit - maybe three lights in the whole place. Nothing's changed in here for decades. Beautiful antique ceiling, wooden back bar, and beer taps. If you look above the bar you'll notice a hanging bamboo structure where the bar gets it's name. Even a pool table if you are ready to throw down. Feeling lazy? Got a TV if you want to catch the game. They don't have Schlitz, but Old Style cans are only $2.50.There's several arcade machines tucked away in the corner which are unplugged to save money. Doubt they will ever be plugged in again. The heat is barely on, with the place hovering around a cool fifty-five degrees. If you're a VIP - they will give you a personal space heater on a stool. Their TV is so fuzzy that it makes standard definition look like a luxury.

You won't find any frozen GFS or Costco prepackaged foods here. Phil makes everything made-to-order from scractch, from his tasty breakfast sandwiches right down to his delicious burgers.I'm a fan of the double cheeseburger. It's like eating a \"crave case\" of sliders all squished into one bun. Two heaping beef patties are pan-fried in butter (i think! at least it tastes like butter!) and then smothered in grilled onions, cheese, and some kind of secret seasoning that makes the burger taste exacly like a White Castle. Top it off with a little mustard, ketchup, mayo, and some of Phil's crunchy hand-cut fries, and you might never return to White Castle again--especially when you can get a double monster burger, fries, and a pop for $3.99!For those looking for the true slider experience, try one of Phil's \"baby\" burgers. These little puppies are what makes him famous on the southside. Pint-sized versions of his larger burgers, these little greasy messes are oh-so-tasty!Go ahead and give Phil's a try.
