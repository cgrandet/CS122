Pizza night. We have had pizza from Phil's a few times but each time had been delivery. It was a cool summer night out so we decided we would pick it up this time instead.I called in my order and spoke to a man on the phone. The time was 7:20 pm. A large special was ordered after a brief discussion. 30 minutes, he said. No, wait. He changed his mind. Better make it 40 minutes. I said, no problem.I showed up at 8:10ish pm and made my way to the counter. There was one family of 4 having their dinner at a table and 3 other customers waiting for their take-out/pick-up order. The family of 4 will come into play later.Behind the counter was a young Hispanic with her hair tied back in a pony tail. She looked busy as she called out an order for someone to come pick up. She asked me my name and I responded. \"Its not ready.\" she said and she turned away before I could even ask her how much longer it would take. She retreated into the kitchen where it looked like there was about 4 or 5 people making pizzas frantically. I decided not to wait for her to return and grabbed a seat in the diner. Customer after customer walked in and asked about their take-out and every response from the woman was \"It's not ready\". And each time, she would turn away as quickly as she could to retreat to the kitchen.Now, I've worked in a restaurant before. I understand that a kitchen can get backed up and things can fall apart pretty quickly. The woman didn't handle the customers very well but at this point, I just thought she was ill-trained and maybe a little rude. This would change later.After waiting for about 15 minutes, I decided to face the rude woman behind the counter. I walked up and waited for her to come back and asked her how long it would take. She asked for my name again and before my lips could even finish forming the last syllable, she responded.\"It's not ready.\"Here's where the family of 4 comes in. The father behind me must have raised his hand to signal for her because at this point she leaned around me and asked him what he needed. Apparently, he wanted another 2 liter of Pepsi because she went to go get it for him. I waited.\"I understand its not ready, but how much longer will it be?\"With an irritated huff, she went into the kitchen and looked on their table of order slips. Without even turning to face me, she shouted \"5 minutes\". Rude? What's worst than rude? Whatever it is, she's riding that border like a pro at this point. At this point, the dining room has 8 other customers waiting. I went back to my game of 2048 on my phone and just waited. At 8:40 pm, I finally heard my name called. Here's where the story actually gets uglier.There was an elderly woman there who had been waiting before I even arrived. She got up and very irately began to complain how people who arrived after her were getting their food before her. Rightly so. The young woman with the pony tail responded by saying her food wasn't ready and that phone orders were at 40 minutes. Remember, I got there at 8:10 pm and it was now 8:40 pm. This poor woman had to have been waiting for more than 40 minutes in that waiting room now. At this point, the elderly woman was visibly angry because she thinks she's being mistreated. In response, the woman with the pony tail laughs. Yah. She laughs. I was stunned. I look into the kitchen to see if anybody there was \"Phil\" or a manager or something had seen this. The closest man to the front was at the pizza oven. He had heard. And he was also laughing.Phil's Pizza is good. It is. But the employees/managers/owner there aren't rude. No, this isn't rudeness. It's contempt. They believe that they can laugh in an elderly woman's face because they're Phil's Pizza. They are hurtful and they are dishonorable. At some point, you have to decide whether good pizza is worth supporting a business that would hurt another person just because they can.We have leftovers. I think I'm just going to throw it away.

All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won't get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald's Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka \"The Value Meal\". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service.

Back in the day, the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was Maxwell's on 31st. In my family during that time, eating at Mcdonalds was luxury item. Why was it a luxury? Because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods. As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available. It doesn't feel right to goto any McDonalds for a salad... it just doesn't make sense to me.I come here a couple times a month for ice coffee, hot coffee and a sandwich or two. The location is convenient to grab a quick bite, pick up my dry cleaning, or pick up a few small items from Walgreens. The occurrence of pan-handlers has increased since Pacific Garden Missions moved to Canal St and it has also died down since the new police station has been placed on 31st and Halsted.

Here was my surprise. I had for a long time heard about the bar and the butt steak, and the history. Especially the history. So I had pictured in my mind a big old 19th century bar with lot's of wood, old booths, not so much a salt-of-the-earth basement rec room that looks as if it dates back to about 1960 instead of the real date of 1881. I felt like the five of us who went there, four neophytes, and two of them unsuspecting West Coasters, had gotten into my Scion time machine and had been transported to Oconto, WI. Not that that's a BAD thing, mind you!Walking in is like entering a saloon in the Old West, where everyone turns to look at you, and you think: \"Gee, I better be friendly and say \"hi\", or somebody might beat me up.\" So we all did. But a genuinely friendly crowd AND a waitress who calls you \"Hon.\" I just love that.So we all ordered the Butt Steak. Our lovely server sold us on their famous hash browns, so we had the bean soup: \u00a0a little salty but well-spiced and flavored and with chunks of ham in it, the steak, which was around 8 oz, sitting on soggy white bread, fries, the requisite thimble of cole slaw, fries, and the hash browns. if I were you, I'd skip the must-have-been-frozen fries and get the hash Browns. They must use very sweet and fresh potatoes. Nicely browned and crunchy, too.The menu has a standard selection of other bar foods, but don't think \"appetizers\" because there is no such section. The subject of dessert never even came up. So it was five guys, five steaks, the side of hash browns, two pitchers of domestic beer (and two Heinies for the guy from Portland), all this for $84.50. A steak dinner with drinks for under $20 per person? That's it. My little Scion must be a magic time machine.Good food, decent steaks, excellent hospitality and salt of the earth dining with good company in Bridgeport, Chicago's own basement rec room neighborhood.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 11, 6]}, "53": {"description": "This place is a must for everyone... even if only once.I like Schaller's even if I am generally the youngest person in there. \u00a0On Friday nights you will often find older adults doing their version of karaoke with the keyboardist. \u00a0Its very, very charming and sweet.When there is a Sox game, this place is filled. \u00a0Many people eat, park in the lot, and walk to the park.The food here is very good. \u00a0My boyfriend is not convinced of this yet - because he order very poorly and got the Chicken Parmesan, fool - but I swear its good. \u00a0Try the Butt Steak. \u00a0It is what they are known for and it is excellent. \u00a0The beets and macaroni salad served with your meal are a nice addition and very good. \u00a0Also, they always have specials... try them, I have never gone wrong.Two minor complaints - 1 - they use pre-packaged rolls... which is weird and sad.2 - they pretty much just have MGD or Miller Lite.Overall, this is a good place and I am glad it is still around. \u00a0Check it out.", "rating": "4", "date": [2007, 8, 26]}, "30": {"description": "You gotta take this for what it is and thats a dive bar.

However, Mitchell's is an egalitarian and tolerant bar. The north side fans were clustered on the west edge of the bar, closest to the venue's largest flat-screen TV (subscribed to Comcast cable). The south side fans (whose club had lost that afternoon), were closer to the door. I seated myself in between, but closer to the south side fans.I began coming to this address when it was \"Puffers' Bar\". From what I overheard, after the south side club won something colossal in 2005, the Puffers drew an offer from some other wanna-be bar owner. They felt this was the time to go out, and so they sold. But aside from whoever is the new owner, the venue has not greatly changed.You can obtain a quality beer here, typically an import, but Three Floyds can be found here, as can Point (which is what I ordered), and it has two Samuel Adams beers, including the seasonal on tap.It took a while for Mitchell's to warm up to me. I was generally ignoring the TV, and reading an English-language pamphlet I brought back from Japan. I did not attribute this to xenophobia. The peculiar combination of what was on TV, and what had occurred earlier that day is to what I attribute it.But just the same, I can't give Mitchell's more than three stars for now. In succeeding trips to the south side, when I cycle back through Mitchell's, then I'll ponder if it can go higher.Transit options: The #8 Halsted route is how to get the 'last mile'. It runs northbound [to Orange & Blue Line \"L\"s] until 1:00 am and southbound until 2:10 am.

So on a snowy night- we headed south down Halsted to Mitchell's. The first thing I loved? Plenty of street parking right in front of the place. We settled in at the bar and glanced around. Mitchell's, while not huge, has room for at least 20 at the bar and tables scattered around which will seat at least 30 more. If just siting and drinking is not your thing- they have a variety of bar games including my favorite \"bar darts\".

The beer is cheap, the selection of beer fairly impressive, and the people friendly and chatty.

I've came here about 10 times ONLY because it is close to where I work, but I promised myself I won't go back anymore. I haven't wrote a review because I usually don't write reviews, especially negative ones, but I honestly dislike this restaurant with a passion. What pushed me to write a review: They have lunch specials (which cost $7 after tax, the norm is $5 for other places). They let you choose egg rolls or BBQ pork as an extra with w/e lunch special you order. I like their BBQ pork over the egg roll, but they always put the BBQ pork in the rice box (with a lot of BBQ sauce), and the BBQ sauce mixes with the lunch special dish. The sauces mix into an awkward salty yet sweet taste which I really don't like. Knowing that, I asked them to separate the BBQ pork from the lunch special and put it in its own container. To my disbelief, they said they can't do that. I paused for a second thinking there might have been some miscommunication, so I explained to them how the sauces mixing makes the lunch special taste weird. They said they understand, but they can't separate them, and recommended me to just have the egg roll instead. I asked why not, they said they don't know, but they just can't do it. This is what pushed me over the edge with them. Only explanation I can think of is that they're trying to save some rice boxes? Needless to say, no more Happiness for me!Food:I have tried 10+ different dishes from them (mostly rice box) and the ONLY one that I actually think is decent is the Mapo Tofu. All the other ones I've tried are garbage. They are 100% Americanized Chinese food. They give you a ridiculous amount of sauce with anything dish that requires sauce. So much sauce that you'd think you ordered some sort of stew/soup. If you order Beef and Broccoli over rice, you'd get Beef and Broccoli stew. It's just disgusting. I personally like traditional Chinese food, but you may like the extra sauce. They are CHEAP:Don't be fooled by the sauce, the actual food content they give you is sparse for the price. Everywhere else, the lunch specials are in the range of $4 - $5.50, this place is $7. Their regular rice boxes (which are about $5-6) are the small cube paper ones that is about half the size of a normal rice box that cost the same. And if you want to order the normal sized rice box, it's $9-11 (once again, it's $5 elsewhere).In addition, they are the ONLY Chinese restaurant I have ever seen that actually CHARGES you for TEA! On their menu, front and center, says \"Additional $1.00 for pot of tea\". I laughed pretty hard when I saw that. Anywhere else they give you a pot of tea just like how American restaurants serve water. You can tell from some restaurants the the owners are skimpy out on content while emptying customers' pockets. Service: Their service is slightly above average for a Chinese restaurant. Their front desk girls are underage (probably daughters), and they don't usually show any emotions. Kind of just a blank face taking your orders. Conclusion:What else can I say? This place simply sucks. I think I've been pretty unbiased towards them, it's just that I never actually got a good experience from this place. I'm theorizing that the only reason they are still in business is because they are the only Americanized Chinese \"restaurant\" in the neighborhood. There are some other Americanized Chinese places around there, but they are more of a \"Pick up to go rice box\" joints, no waitresses. Potsticker House is the only Chinese restaurant with waitresses, but they are traditional Chinese and not Americanized.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 9, 29]}, "46": {"description": "I just dont understand why this place doesn't have higher reviews.

I understand it's hard to keep a list that long current, but maybe you could list on the chalkboard things you know you don't have and save people some time? Mixed crowd, from the young hipsters to middle aged adults hanging around. The music was way, WAY too loud; you should be able to have a conversation with people at your table without screaming when you're at a neighborhood bar. Blaring music is for dance clubs. And I'm under 30, so it's definitely the bar's volume issue. Take it down a notch and it would be great. I also wish they had more variety of ciders; Ace cider is my personal least favorite brand and what they mostly serve, tastes flat to me.

It's a fairly limited list of pub grub especially when you compare it to the many other options located throughout the ball park on the 100 level. \u00a0The beer list though was surprisingly extensive for a baseball park, and they also had a full bar and wine.

The people who run it are nice but this is about their business.I have only been to Glo On Braids twice and unfortunately I won't be returning because they are getting too expensive. Don't get me wrong, they do a good job on the hair but I am not made of money and at some point you have to question what you are really getting for your money. The first time I went the cost for mid back Senegalese twists was $200 in September or October of 2013. The cost for the same hair-do in February 2014 is $250 which is now really out of my price range. I understand that prices have to increase for inflation but a $50 increase is ridiculous. Now I don't have a lot of experience with getting my hair braided/twisted \u00a0and so I went with Glo On because they had really good reviews. Everyone seems to have an opinion of what makes a hair braider good and all I knew was that this place had good reviews and they weren't too difficult to get to. Something else that bugged me besides the price was willing to write off is the experience. When you have someone sitting in a chair for up to 6 hours and the client is paying you a lot of money I think it is courteous to offer them refreshments such as water and it also can't hurt to apologize if you are delayed by something.The last time I went I think that my spot was overbooked because at one point there were 3 people at once waiting to have there hair done including myself (though she did have an assistant). At some times I was left sitting waiting for long periods of time because she was working on other people. Shavon started doing my hair at 9:30 but I didn't get out of her office until 6pm. It is in the south loop off of Wabash and Roosevelt Road.I don't have a lot of experience with hair braiders so I thought I had found a winner that I would return to for years to come.

I went in there to get a new set of brake levers installed on my trusty steed. Not only did they do a great job but they also were quick to install them. What really helps set this bike shop above the others in my mind is its great charm.

\u00a0Take them to the dining room at the Stadium Club. \u00a0It's a white tablecloth dining room on multiple tiers with a fantastic view of the field from the right-field corner. \u00a0The basic meal is a very good $29/person ($13 for children) all-you-can-eat buffet by Levy Restaurants that's comparable to a four-star hotel buffet, with drinks and desserts costing extra. \u00a0Opening day, the buffet had seared scallops (fantastic) and ahi tuna, duck confit, and carving stations with great roasted turkey and veal. \u00a0In the past, I've had very good roast beef and prime rib, and for 1:05pm Sunday games they have brunch including an omelet station. \u00a0Reservations are recommended in the dining room, but they usually have some open tables except for the really popular games.Bar Window Seats:This is the front section of the upstairs bar, along the glass facing the field. \u00a0It's the same food and service as the rest of the bar, but less crowded and with a great view. \u00a0Technically, reservations are required to sit here, but sometimes they're not that strict about this rule. \u00a0If you bring kids, this is probably the best place in the Stadium Club for them, fully isolated from the bar atmosphere with a view and they have a kid's meal for $6. \u00a0It may be worth noting that last year the entire Stadium Club become totally smoke free.Bar:The bar is essentially a typical sports bar, with much better food. \u00a0A scaled back version of the dining room buffet is available for $18/person although they only let you fill your plate once. \u00a0There's a sandwich station where they carve a phenomenal sandwich for you for $11, and a variety of other items on the menu. \u00a0There's not much of a view of the park from most of the bar, although there's an abundance of good televisions around just like the rest of the Stadium Club.Something really odd happened on opening day after the game, in that my friend and I realized that the 2005 World Series trophy was sitting behind us on a barstool! \u00a0We naturally posed for a couple of pictures with it before someone official-looking came by and took it away. \u00a0It's amazing who and what you can run into at the Stadium Club!In general, throughout the Stadium Club, service is great and the employees very attentive. \u00a0They handle the problem of waiting for your bill at the end as you're impatiently waiting to run to your game seats by asking you to sign once using a credit card (no cash!) before the end, adding an 18% gratuity plus 9.25% tax. \u00a0That way you have paid for everything in case you dash to your seats and don't have to deal with tipping unless you want to add more. \u00a0Also, there's a $5/person charge for the dining room or bar window area if you want to watch the game from there.It opens two hours before game-time, although for the dining room the buffet opens one hour before day games and Saturday 6:05pm games. \u00a0It tends to have last call at about an hour or so after each game, although after big games you may have to wait to get in. \u00a0Note there is a dress code, but it's pretty lax as most people are wearing all manner of White Sox attire and jeans, I believe the types of things they prohibit are cutoffs, torn clothes, and tank-tops.All-in-all, if you get a chance to go, you should, as it makes for a great experience.", "rating": "4", "date": [2007, 4, 3]}, "2": {"description": "I don't get to be VIP very often, so getting access to the Stadium Club was quite the treat.

But buying the cheap little eyelash strips from wall-mart are always a pain in the butt to get on and off! So, I decided to do some research about professional eyelash extensions. The one eyelash salon that kept appearing everywhere was the one and only Chicago Lashes. Thanks to the wonderful Yelp reviews here, and recommendations amongst those who know a thing or two about eyelashes, I decided to try this place: and the end results are PHENOMENAL.I called this salon to book an appointment on Tuesday and was very fortunate to be able to get an appointment two days later at 9:00AM (Which is great because this salon is always very busy!)The receptionist, James (Who I believe is also the store manager as well) Greeted me \u00a0with enthusiasm and cheerfulness the moment I walked into the door. He told me to have a seat, and that Moon (the lash technician) would be with me momentarily. He offered me tea, water, and even coffee too while waiting. I got a chance to look around- and this place was not only very clean, but very well decorated! The cute chairs at the front of the shop were super comfy as well. Moon greeted me with a warm smile, and inquired if I had lashes before. I informed her this would be my first time, and she grabbed a book (that contained pictures of various lashes) and we sat down for several minutes discussing the options at hand. She didn't rush me at all, and was very comforting to converse with. We decided for a semi natural look- which would add just the amount of 'glam' I wanted, while keeping it natural looking as well.I laid down and Moon began her work, explaining every little detail- every process of the way. Eventually, I fell asleep, and the next thing I knew, my lashes were complete! I believe it took about a full 2 hours- which is great! Moon handed me the mirror and I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY LASHES! They were perfect! The experience at Chicago Lashes was absolutely wonderful! Park was a breeze (a whole bunch of spots right outside the salon).

And when she re applied the lashes, it didn't burn my eyes at all! I was not in pain and it was a smooth application just like how it was before when I had my lashes done. She did a wonderful job, took her time and made sure it looked good. We had a good conversation so I didn't even notice the time anymore. I was 15 minutes late because of the traffic and the rain but she still waited for me and took me in and made sure that I can still have a good experience in this place.

In addition, several extensions were clumped together on one side. It's been 16 days since I had my lashes done and the remaining lashes are irritating my eyelids and going in several directions.

The location is convenient even for me who comes from the northwest suburbs, it's a straight shot down Addison Ave after I get off I-90 and for the most part, traffic and parking isn't terrible when you book appointments at non-rush hour times or when there's a Cubs game.The scheduling system is really easy as I have been using their online booking system via Vagaro on my iPhone. I can select the tech I want, and find available appointment slots for any particular day. And for the most part, appointments run on time. The few times my appointments have run late have been either my own fault for running late (but often been caught up with the girls' efficiency) or the precious customer has run them late. It happens but really not often at all.The lashes, glue and work are excellent. I have gone to two different lash places before in the beginning, spent more money and was not half as satisfied. My lashes typically last 3-4 weeks before needing a refill and that's with me working out (and sweating) 4-5 times a week, and have gone swimming during the summer. Obviously, you do have to take good care of your lashes at home and not pick at them throughout each day.

Well, I don't know about you.. But buying the cheap little eyelash strips from wall-mart are always a pain in the butt to get on and off!

He told me to have a seat, and that Moon (the lash technician) would be with me momentarily. He offered me tea, water, and even coffee too while waiting. I got a chance to look around- and this place was not only very clean, but very well decorated! The cute chairs at the front of the shop were super comfy as well. Moon greeted me with a warm smile, and inquired if I had lashes before. I informed her this would be my first time, and she grabbed a book (that contained pictures of various lashes) and we sat down for several minutes discussing the options at hand. She didn't rush me at all, and was very comforting to converse with. We decided for a semi natural look- which would add just the amount of 'glam' I wanted, while keeping it natural looking as well.I laid down and Moon began her work, explaining every little detail- every process of the way. Eventually, I fell asleep, and the next thing I knew, my lashes were complete! I believe it took about a full 2 hours- which is great! Moon handed me the mirror and I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY LASHES!

They were all good drinks, however they were a bit on the weak side. Good nonetheless! !!For starters, \u00a0we had gotten the potato skins, while a bit on the small side, they were very good. Loved the bacon, cheese and scallions! After all the food we got, I'm glad they were the size they were.After that, of course we had the 10 piece hot, buffalo chicken wings, and a steak and mushroom quesadilla to go with them. The sauce on those wings was delicious, while spicy, but the spice didn't cover up the flavor. The ranch was just the icing on the cake. Very good.The steak quesadilla had a dipping sauce that kind of had a taste of blue cheese. My boyfriend and I aren't fans of blue cheese so we just dipped the quesadilla in the Buffalo sauce. Haha! The steak on there though was more like a ground beef type of thing, but no complaints here! The quesadilla itself was a very good size and perfect for sharing.After having the potato skins, \u00a0wings, quesadilla and drinks, you'd think we'd be good and ready to go, but while I'm the sweets girl, I can't leave a place without having dessert! On the menu, you see a very enticing picture of the chocolate lava turtle cake and I for sure had to get that. \u00a0Once that came out it was topped off with a scoop of ice cream and chocolate drizzle. It was very nice and It satisfied my sweet tooth! Once my spoon went into it, it exploded with all this chocolatey goodness just like a volcano. Love!!

I use the system, which is comprised of floor-to-ceiling poles, clothing racks, and shelves, for my retail women's clothing boutique. I had previously put the shelving system together myself in a different location, but in my new space there was an unforeseen problem: the poles were not tall enough to reach the nearly 14 foot ceilings. After almost falling off of a ladder, I decided to find some help. Joseph responded quickly to my request, came over to assess the situation and figured out a solution to the not-long-enough-poles dilemma. He offered to construct some pine boxes to prop the poles on and affix them to so that they would then have the height needed to reach the ceiling! Brilliant! He made me a very reasonable quote for the project and finished the pine boxes in a very agreeable amount of time. Then he proceeded to complete the whole project, installing the boxes, and poles, and shelves, etc., in an afternoon. Also he is VERY good at design and knows what looks good and what will look bad. He assisted me in designing my space, i.e, where to put the poles, where to put the dressing room, etc. etc. He was extremely adept at customizing what we had to work with, supplementing extra pieces, and sawing down pieces to fit our custom design. Using every nook and cranny of our small space to it's best potential. Perfect!!About 8 months later, one of the poles came out of the ceiling in the studio section of my store, my fault for piling WAY too much weight on it. I called Joseph and he came over and fixed it right away, and also adjusted the other poles so as to be able to support more weight safely. Of course, when I decided I was MOVING my store - just one door over to a corner space with much better street exposure and triple the space-- I called Joseph right away with my new project. This one was a doozy- disassembling and re-assembing \u00a0the pole system, adding more pieces, rearranging everything, and also moving some very ungainly furniture. He and his team handled the whole task efficiently and professionally, and best of all, safely... I don't have to worry about the thing falling on someone.I would recommend Pagoda Studios without any hesitation if you are looking for a professional, innovative contractor who will go above and beyond your expectations.

He's got some awesome training and is a great teacher. \u00a0It pays off immediately. \u00a0For instance, I was cursing this year's epic potholes for my popping tires, which Adam didn't contest. \u00a0But he also explained how the type of tires I had (skinny, vintage touring) are more likely to pop and how the air pressure plays in. I felt like the smartest kid on the block and now understand how to pick tires for the appropriate city. I took the opportunity to talk with Adam about a short list of items that needed tending. (Seat, racks, locks, lights, etc.) I'd gone to the store a couple times but the sticker shock made me realize that Suze O \u00a0would want me to process - ask myself, are these things that I needed or that I wanted? \u00a0Adam, who also has a store in Bridgeport, broke out a catalogue and helped me order everything I needed (wanted) at prices that Suze O would ok. \u00a0(I replaced a my roommate's light for $12 bucks less than she paid, etc.) Adam used a rad device to scan my credit card, sent me a receipt immediately and delivered the items to my house when they came in.

Helllllllo heartburn. I basically chugged a gallon of milk throughout the night trying to sleep. Mother-in-Law is a beast of a woman and a sandwich. Not my mother-in-law though, she is amazing. (Ha ha) So anyway, the customer service.... this wretched beast of a woman ordered $3 worth of food and left.... She returned about 15 minutes later complaining of cold stale fries and a flavorless Sierra Mist. The guy at the counter made every effort to appease the gal and she acted like he had personally shoved her grandmother down a flight of stairs. Seriously, she was LIVID that she had surely been purposely mistreated due to her race and this guy handled it like a champ! We watched in horror as she threw her fries at his cook and demanded to know if she would eat such disgusting things. You ordered a deep fried pizza puff and french fries, made a huge scene, scared pedestrians walking by, and threatened to call the police over this injustice....

Once inside you walk upstairs to a large dining area. The restaurant has a warm, inviting atmosphere and nice decor. Our waitress was wasn't extremely engaging but she was pleasant and efficient. I'd originally ordered the combo platter that consisted of tacos, tostadas and an enchilada. I don't like enchiladas so I'd asked for two tacos and one tostadas instead. But the waitress came back and said that she was informed that no substitutions were allowed. Huh? You mean you can't substitute an enchilada for a taco?? Seriously? That makes absolutely NO sense to me. What difference does it make? Since I wasn't allowed to make the substitution I changed my order to the taco dinner. I ended up getting the three beef tacos with rice and beans.The food was hot, fresh and flavorful. My only complaint is that the rice was a bit salty.

(Chocolate for your Body!) \u00a0She never used a cuticle gel, she barely pushed them back. \u00a0She didn't cut any of my hangnails, which weren't bad but could have used some TLC. \u00a0After filing, she didn't have me wash my hands so they were full of dust. \u00a0 A few swift strokes of the polish and she was done. \u00a0In the meantime the other manicurist came in and started my sisters nails. \u00a0I was done a good 15 minutes before her. \u00a0And in that time I noticed the woman who did my nails took the tools that she used threw them in the sink, rinsed them, and then proceeded to put them back in her station to use for the next guest!!!!! NO SANITIZER, NO BAKING, NOTHING BUT WATER!!!! \u00a0My sisters manicure was ok. \u00a0I haven't talked to her to see how they are holding up.fast forward 5 days...9 out of 10 nails are peeling! not chipping, but peeling off. \u00a0Some were really bad, some were just starting to peel on the sides. \u00a0I called the nail station and let them know what was going on with my nails. \u00a0They were very nice and told me to come in to have them fixed. \u00a0I get there, show the same woman who did my nails how bad they were and she says she'll fix them. \u00a0No I'm sorry... that's so strange... I've never seen this before. \u00a0I sit down for her to fix them, and she starts peeling the polish off my nails. \u00a0I asked her if she could use the acetone to get them off so she didn't damage my nails, and she said she didn't have to because they were peeling right off. \u00a0Same as last time... no love just polish. \u00a0She filed off what was left on my nails after she ripped the polish off and started painting. \u00a025 minutes later I was in my car on my way home. \u00a0fast forward 3 days...2 nails are already peeling. \u00a0You can see that the topcoat does not cover the color coat on most nails. \u00a0It's really bad. \u00a0If you notice, this is my first yelp review. \u00a0It's that bad!! \u00a0 I will not be calling her this time. \u00a0Instead, I will take my voice to yelp. \u00a0I can not understand how an owner pushes out such low quality work and still has a business. \u00a0If you have been to a quality nail salon and know what to expect from a business, than I would suggest you stay as far away from this place as possible.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 4, 8]}, "17": {"description": "This is a great local nail shop with excellent hours, open to 9PM!!!

One of the great things here is that you can order pretty much anything off the menu and have faith that it will be executed to at least good quality. There are too many Chinese restaurants out there that specialize in just a few excellent dishes and have mediocre offerings for the remainng items. Add in surprisingly good service for a small restaurant and inexpensive prices (considering that this is a Michelin recommended restaurant that serves gourmet food) and you have a winning combination.Here's what I thought about some of the dishes I tried:Stir-Fried Cumin Flavor Lamb \u5b5c\u7136\u7f8a\u8089: Very strong cumin flavor, very tender lamb that was fatty and had just the right amount of salt and seasoning. The chilis here add more aroma than they do spiciness. Probably the best I've had since TL's Four Seasons.Fried Fish Fillet with Special Sauce \u6ed1\u6e9c\u9b5a\u7247: The nice garlic flavor really makes this a comfortable dish to eat with rice (like what you'd eat all day to relax while you're snowed in). The vegetables in the dish were really crisp and juicy to provide perfect contrast to the soft-as-tofu fish. Probably the best I've had since Yilin.Shredded Chicken with Basil \u4e5d\u5c64\u5854\u96de\u67f3: A very strong basil flavor comes through in this dish. The chicken is cut thin but very tender (more like pork than like shredded chicken texture). The juicy bell peppers go excellently with the chicken. Strong contender to Mapo's version of this dish.Beef Roll \u725b\u8089\u5377\u9905: Very well balanced, the beef flavor could come out a bit more but that doesn't really detract much from the dish. The pancake is perfectly crisp on the outside with a nice bouncy texture within. Strong contender to Hing Kee and Mapo's version of this dish.Grilled Lamb Skewer \u70e4\u7f8a\u8089\u4e32 and Grilled Chicken Skewer \u70e4\u96de\u8089\u4e32: Personally I prefered the lamb a bit more than the chicken since it was more flavorful but they were both cooked very well, very flavorful with a little more aggression on the saltiness (other dishes were generally pretty light, so this is closer to what you'd normally expect from Chinese food), with an excellent bouncy texture and slightly crispy outside.Overall, excellent food at excellent prices. Don't confuse homestyle taste with home cooking -- the flavors are authentic but definitely prepared by an trained chef. None of the items were the best of each dish I've ever had, but overall each dish was well above average. As the quality is close to the signature items at other restaurants, this will definitely save you a lot of travelling and adventures if you are short on time (but I strongly encourage you to explore and Yelp about other restaurants if you have the time!).

We eat Chinese take-out way more than I like to admit and have created a pretty solid circuit of restaurants over time.

That in and of itself is a pretty incredible feat in the Chinese takeout game. The real star here is the food. Everything we've had is spectacular. - Xia Long Bao (soup dumplings) - Best I've had. Obviously these are a little difficult for takeout anywhere as the soup may end up leaking out but everything about it is excellent. Order while dining in for best experience. - Shrimp and chive steamed dumplings - Best I've had in the area. The dough on the dumpling is perfect. Just the right amount of bite to the noodle and the proportion of shrimp, pork, and chives is spot on.- Long shape pot sticker - Best I've had in the area. I think \u00a0because these are pan fried they have a tendency to come out greasy but not at Home Style Taste. The outside is perfectly crisp with the juiciest pork filling. - Chive pie - Yum! A lovely little pocket of green freshness. - Beef fried noodle - Really any fried noodle (we also order shrimp fried noodle from time to time). The noodles are excellent. With a mix of noodles, beef, cabbage, and onions this dish is one that I'm constantly craving. Excellent comfort food and one of my favorite things to eat while sitting on the couch in my pajamas binge watching Netflix. The only thing that's slightly disappointing is the crab rangoon. It's a guilty pleasure of mine but I just can't get down with these 'goons. I noticed a lot of other reviewers raving about them but I seriously don't understand why. These are WAY too sweet for me.

Do not order these. \u00a0The skewers were mostly fat and were over seasoned with cumin and other spices. \u00a0It was probably to cover up the bad cut of meat used to make this dish.Deep Fried Saut\u00e9ed String Beans: \u00a0nothing too special about this string bean dish. \u00a0It tastes similar to many string bean dishes I have eaten in the past. \u00a0If you enjoy string beans then I would recommend giving these a try.Sizzling Beef in Sweet and Sour Sauce: I have never seen or heard of beef in sweet and sour sauce before; it's usually cooked with pork. \u00a0This was delicious! The cuts of beef were tender and the sauce was really well balanced between the acidity and the sweetness. \u00a0Definitely order this if you enjoy sweet and sour dishes.Xiao Long Bao (Pork Dumplings): if you don't know what xiao long baos are, then you are in for a treat. \u00a0Xiao long baos are steamed pork dumplings filled with soup. \u00a0WARNING: do not put the whole dumpling in your mouth once it comes out. \u00a0It is extremely hot. \u00a0These are some decent dumplings because some places the pork isn't flavorful enough or the soup is dried up, but at Homestyle the flavor and the cook on the dumplings were perfect.Homestyle Taste is definitely a winner in my books. \u00a0The entrees lean more towards Northern Chinese style cuisine, so if that is not what you are looking for then this is not the place for you. \u00a0The servers here are very prompt and attentive. \u00a0The only thing is that they speak Mandarin (not Cantonese which is the dialect I speak) and their English isn't the greatest. \u00a0Either way, the location is convenient and the food is delicious. \u00a0I will definitely be back to try out other dishes from here.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 1, 10]}, "24": {"description": "Surprised by the great reviews.

We love the food because it really feels and tastes like home cooking. The boiled beef in hot pepper sauce is very tasty if you like spicy dishes. Their spicy dish is not overly spicy and you can always ask for extra spicy if you prefer. I personally love the beef stew soup. It has alot of favor and it is served with a generous portion. Service is usually outstanding until the last visit. They always have all female servers but this time we noticed a new face, a male server. I know that we are not the only table that sensed his weirdness. First, he kept saying 'anything else' when he takes your order. It gets pretty annoying. He also does not seem to be very familiar with the menu when one diner asked for suggestions for a dish with pea pods. Another customer came in and asked for a carryout menu, he responded that they don't have a carryout menu available. Really?? During our dinner, the next table stepped outside and clearly left the keys on the table to indicate that they are not running the bill. The male server ran out right after them. Luckily, another server saw the key and stopped him to avoid additional embarrassing moments. When it was time to pay our bill, my husband asked the male server for the bill. He came back with the doggy bag and 'the bill' by itself without the bill cover. My husband handed him the credit card and the male server came back with the bill, cc receipt and cc in the bill cover. Weird. Why not bring one in the first place? I told my husband that I will tip in cash as he signed the cc receipt. The male server rushed over to our table as he watched my husband closes the bill cover. He stopped himself as my husband handed me the bill cover so I can put cash tip inside. The last draw for me was when the male server came over to pick up the bill as soon as I placed it on the corner of our table. I used to work as a waitress in the past and i believe in taking care of our servers. The male server is such a weirdo and I can tell the surrounding non-Asian diners are somewhat offended by his behavior.

As we are leaving the bar, I spot a man half my size with a bag and an ice chest. I knew who he was before his word left my lips. He spoke first, \"Tamales.\" My girlfriend screamed in excitement. I gave him twenty dollars.We ate half of them, her drunk, and myself partly sober. She was in love.We ate the other half for breakfast and they were still great. So they passed the sobriety test.It isn't my great grandmother's tamales, it isn't the best, but god damn when you need tamales and you see him, you're a fool to not take that chance. They're small, but tasty.The verde is only spicy if you think taco bell hot sauce packets are spicy. It is flavorable, but spicy? No.Should it be covered in sour cream? Do you think desecrating all that is holy is okay?The only thing that needs to be on those tamales other than ingredients is my mouth.It is roughly a dollar a tamale, maybe like seven five cents.

When I opened the pot, there were no tea leaves in there so they must have brewed it elsewhere, which explains the lack of flavor.Service was okay. The young waitresses were friendly, but clearly inexperienced. They had trouble and took a long time to clear off our table.

Being a native northern Chinese myself and having spent more than 10 years in the states I know my Chinese food well. I have enjoyed going to Ed's potsticker house as well as the other new Dongbei restaurant down the street from Ed's on halsted. They are both legit and well worth visiting. However, going to northern city today left me disgusted and feeling sick. We ordered one of the famous casserole dishes as well as a fish dish. the meat in the dish taste so bad I had to spit it out right away it's has a nasty smell as well. we asked the chef and he claimed that it was an extra ingredient.. he was not very understanding and a bit rude. (grand it Chinese restaurants are not known for customer service but I have definitely seen better). we left the giant pot of the pork casserole there. Then the fish came, although they claim it's live catch from the tank, it tasted so fishy and had a strong dirt taste which generally means it's not fresh. On top of all this, we were sitting right next to the tank, no one has come by and got the fish since we got in the restaurant! urgh I was so upset and disgusted at that point I decided to just pay and leave. All the waiting staff realizes that I am upset but no one said anything.. all in all a terrible experience, ruined my day for sure!

After 10 minutes of deciding what to eat, we ordered two lamb skewer sticks, a Northern Lamb soup, beef tummy noodles, and two chili chicken. The environment feels clean due to the plain walls (some decorations) and had two colors. It felt odd noticing the people here used to work at a business still currently in business....The waitress warned that the two chili chicken will be spicy.Pros: service was good, BYOBCons: food was mediocre. The soup came out bland (plain water with ingredients... I should say lamb fat and chicken fat? We sent it back to the kitchen and they just added MSG). The lamb skewer sticks were pretty good, though all lard once again. It had an even layer of spices and cumin powder. The beef noodle soup was plain weird to me. It just didn't have the soup quality that makes me crave for it. As for the two chili chicken it was a disappointment. It was a plateful of chili and around 1 cup of chicken meat (diced). For the price of $11, I felt gyped. After the whole meal, I doubt I will come back. There's nothing on the menu special enough for me to decide to come back anyway. I still prefer the other Mandarin restaurants over this one.For the price, it seems like the meal was served on a boat. I wasn't ill or anything, but I was nauseated by the rockiness of the booths.

Order wrong, and it's not so great. We tried:Wonton in chili oil ($4.95): didn't expect this classic Sichuan dish in a Northern Chinese restaurant, but the wontons skins were perfect and coated in fragrant chili oil. I was a little surprised they weren't as spicy as I'd hoped, but after all, Potsticker House isn't a Sichuan place.Beef noodle soup ($7.95): A huge, fragrant bowl of noodle soup. The noodles were definitely more cooked than I like, but the soup itself was good. Very flavorful, not overly salty or oily.Smoked pork cake ($6.95): Think of a traditional scallion pancake, except filled with sliced, smoked pork. This turned out to be a good choice as a side dish, the pancake was perfectly done, crispy and a little chewy without being too oily. Didn't think the pork added too much.Xiaolongbao ($5.95): I'm surprised the XLB are so popular judging by other Yelp reviews, because these were just not good. Skins were too thick and dense, the pork filling lacked flavor, and there wasn't enough soup in the dumpling. You can see the northern Chinese influence in the XLB and it's not a good thing.Boiled jiaozi ($5.95): We tried both varieties, pork and sanxian (shrimp and chive) and both were good. The dumplings weren't spectacular, but the skins were clearly handmade and pleasantly chewy, a simple dish done right.House special potstickers ($5.95): Meh. The long rectangular shape was interesting and I've never had potstickers like that, but the filling was unremarkable and there wasn't much meat in them. Very greasy.Tianjin style baozi ($5.95): This, on the other hand, was a definite winner. The baozi were perfectly fluffy, warm, and just slightly sweet with a tasty pork meatball inside. Compare these with the xiaolongbao, and you can tell this is really a northern Chinese restaurant.Beijing style eggplant ($8.95): My favorite dish of the night, the eggplant was just firm enough and sauteed perfectly. Another very simple northern dish with lots of eggplant and strong flavors of ginger, garlic, and soy sauce.Service was polite but inattentive (not unexpected.) Almost no tables were occupied when we got there around 6pm on a Thursday night, but it filled up rapidly.

It's been a favorite of my family for a long time. However, I really think you have to know what to order when you go there otherwise your experience may not be so good. Here are the dishes that I think Ed's does especially well: (they are mostly Northern Chinese dishes because that's really what Ed's is good at - e.g. noodles and pancakes): - Beef noodle soup: I love the beef noodle soup. Sometimes the quality is inconsistent but even when I would say the quality is not the best, it's still pretty darn good. The soup is really flavorful and the noodles are the perfect chewy texture because they are hand-pulled. It's also huge so you can share. I would say that generally, Ed's noodle dishes are pretty good because of the texture of those hand-pulled noodles. I've tried a number of them, but I always go back to the beef noodle soup because that soup is so tasty. The fried rice is generally pretty tasty here too.- A lot of people like the house potstickers. These are not really potstickers in the traditional sense, but long pieces of dough with ground meat in them. I like these too, but I really prefer the pan fried pancake with smoked pork. It's kind of like a green onion pancake sandwich with smoked pork, sauce, and green onions inside. One of the best things you'll ever eat. - Clear wide cold noodles with pork and vegetables (liang pi). This is a Northern Chinese specialty and I think Ed's makes it well. Not everyone likes this dish however, so if you've never had it before - note that you might not like it. - Salt & Pepper Seafood Dish: I don't know if they still have this. I think they still have the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, but they might still \u00a0have the version of this dish with squid, shrimp, fish. My brother loves this dish, and it is quite tasty. One thing I would NOT recommend. The dumplings are passable here, which is funny because it's called Ed's Potsticker House. I have high standards for dumplings because my grandmother makes the best dumplings in the world, and I'm always comparing restaurant dumplings to hers. Ed's are just ok, especially compared to other items that are more delicious on the menu. Also, I don't know why people rave about the Shanghai soup dumplings here. I've tried these multiple times hoping to like them, and they have no soup. How can they be soup dumplings WITHOUT SOUP?? Plus, this is a restaurant that specializes in Northern Chinese cuisine. Soup dumplings are a Shanghainese/Wuxi food, so it's not suprising that Ed's doesn't make them that well.Also, Ed's is great to come to for a traditional Chinese breakfast. You can get the mung bean flour roll with egg (jian bing guo zi), which is basically like a fried savory cruller with an egg pancake with green onions wrapped around. Inside the pancake are some savory sauces, like chili paste. This is one of my favorite types of Chinese breakfast, and it's hard to come by in Chicago. They also have good soy milk (dou jiang) and plain fried crullers (you tiao). The savory tofu soup is also quite good (dou fu nao).", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 16]}, "49": {"description": "The quality of service at this place has really dropped as it has become too popular for its own good.

It was the day after some very hard partying and all that was needed was some comfort food that was healthier than junk food.Zaytune hit the spot with a delicious and huge falafel wrap. It was wrapped in bread that they made and would be better called flat bread than pita. I also ordered some homemade tasting baba ghanoush that was delicious and came with more flat bread. The bread really isn't like typical pita. It is much bigger and flakier and not as thick....and better. My wife had a falafel salad (unfortunately they were out of tabouli) which had romaine lettuce and tomatoes dressed with a tahini dressing and piled with falafel. She wanted some fries and I have to say that the fries here are some of the best ever, flavored with herbs and with a Mediterranean style dipping sauce that was better than the typical ketchup or aioli. So tasty! They also threw in some salsa that was good with a nice zing to it and came with homemade pita chips.This was so tasty and exactly what was needed.

Now, in the interest of full disclosure: My co-worker and her husband own the place, but I'd never had the chance to try it.Today she had him bring in a few pizzas as a treat for our office, one of which was tomato, spinach and garlic. The ingredients all tasted really fresh, which made an impact on me. Garlic was paper-thin and sliced this morning; the tomatoes were fresh and ripe and flavorful. For me, what really made this pizza fantastic was the garlic. I don't know what the deal is with fresh garlic on pizza, but in my hometown the pizza places stopped offering it altogether (maybe it's the price, as I think a few of those take-and-bake places would add it if you brought it to them). The garlic on this pizza was so good, it's making my mouth water thinking about it. Not at all overwhelming, and with the fresh tomato slices it had the perfect balance. I also didn't ever really consider myself a big fan of spinach, so I'm glad he decided to throw these ingredients together on the pizza.I'm disappointed that we didn't know this place existed (at least, those in my old office), because I would have loved to have this instead of having to suffer through Connie's pizza for four years.

Once we moved back to Chicago, the 1st thing we did was order a pizza from there. Unfortunately, it happened to be the wrong pizza, that was delivered. When I called to let them know of the mistake, I was treated so rudely as if it were my fault. We even offered to take the pizza back instead of waiting an 1 1/2 hrs for a correct order to be remad & sent back. Upon arrival, there were 2 boyish looking women who had no customer service training, whatsoever. That was the first incident. \u00a0 \u00a0 The 2nd time we ordered from Lina's, it was for pick up. We pulled up, my husband went in to pay & get our pizza seeing I had just had foot surgery that day & was returning fm the hospital. I gave him my debit card to pay. He went in & they gave him the hardest time. No buggy I thought since I was right outside. Went in, paid & went home. Got home to open up our dinner & come to find out our pizza was extremely burned on the bottom. So burned that me, a person who loves burned food, couldn't even eat it! When I called to let them know, I again was spoken to as if it was my fault. As I explained to the call taker that we'd return the pizza for a better cooked one, I was told I'd be receiving my $ back instead. I wasn't going for that. So, we took the old pizza back & asked for the owner or Mngr. a boyish looking woman w/black short hair & 1/2 shaved head became annoyed by the request & huffed & puffed at us. She let us know that if we didn't like the pizza we could go somewhere else. I let her know, as I showed her the burned pizza bottom, that we like Lina's, that's why we continue being long term customers. But, what we didn't like was being treated poorly by the employees and having constant issues w/incorrect orders being delivered as well as burned food. Needless to say, we received our correct remade order. The unfortunate part is, every time after that we've ordered, we've always received ignorance along with continuous cooking issues.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Today, we place an order for their, buy a jumbo get a medium for $2, deal & an order of cheese fries. We actually were completely hesitant because of prior issues and also because we've discovered Benny's Pizza on 18th St. Has won our taste buds. But, we were starving & Lina's is close to home. We even picked up the order. Get home to sit down & eat & of course, our order is screwed up...again. Our pizza was supposed to be 1/2 pep, 1/2 sausage. It was wrong! We call & again, the call taker gets an attitude w/my young daughter. Seriously, how hard can a pizza call takers job be? Every single time that we order, something is wrong w/our order. And, to make Things worse, cheese fries are actually just an order of fries w/a tiny container of cheese. They even got that part wrong!!! What was supposed to be cheese, was really ranch dressing. When we went back for cheese, seeing that we paid for cheese, upon entering, we got a laugh in the face by the employees when we brought the issue to their attention. We walked out of there extremely unhappy, no apology, got our cup of cheese and a credit for their mistake. Not even our $ back, but a credit! They'll take our $, screw up our order & then tell us that there's no way to refund our $ back for their mistake of an absent ingredient. UNFAIR PRACTICE!!  \u00a0 \u00a0 Basically, they're unfairly forcing us to commit to another purchase. We'll actually only purchase sodas/our credit.

I'm pretty eclectic in what I enjoy, but lately I've been having problems with a certain subsect of toy collecting - MIB/MIC - that's Mint In Box or Mint On Card.See, when I was growing up, my favorite shows were Batman The Animated Series and the original run of the Ninja Turtles. While there are tons of toys I'm more than happy to remove from their cards so that they can breath freely and move about on my shelves, action figures from those two shows tend to stay on the card if I can find them in such a condition - that is to say I have a hard time finding them in that shape at all.Enter Quake. Dave, the proprietor and sole guy on hand during shop hours goes out of his ways to accommodate requests (The Lady has a thing for mint on card figures from horror films - she requested The Somnambulist from The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari - Dave had somehow acquired it within two weeks and swiftly let us know it was in his possession and could soon be in her's). the Harley Quinn figure from B:TAS - the harder to find one - found it here. one of the Neutrinos from TMNT - here too.Dave keeps an exhaustive but well organized and well curated selection of toys and figures in his relatively small space - and he uses it well! The store is packed from literally floor to ceiling with mostly still on card or in box wares and for the more adventurous and less picky, he has large bins of used figures with scuffs and scratches for a couple bucks a piece.What I really appreciate though is Dave's particular attention to what each person who walks into his store is looking for. In my case, he knows my sweet tooth for anything from B:TAS as well as figures from the mid 80's Kenner produced DC Super Powers line (the holy grail of super hero toy lines!) and has made a point to set figures aside for me until I've been able to come in and pick them up.With service that personalized and selection that solid, how on earth can you go wrong?

I'm pretty eclectic in what I enjoy, but lately I've been having problems with a certain subsect of toy collecting - MIB/MIC - that's Mint In Box or Mint On Card.See, when I was growing up, my favorite shows were Batman The Animated Series and the original run of the Ninja Turtles. While there are tons of toys I'm more than happy to remove from their cards so that they can breath freely and move about on my shelves, action figures from those two shows tend to stay on the card if I can find them in such a condition - that is to say I have a hard time finding them in that shape at all.Enter Quake. Dave, the proprietor and sole guy on hand during shop hours goes out of his ways to accommodate requests (The Lady has a thing for mint on card figures from horror films - she requested The Somnambulist from The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari - Dave had somehow acquired it within two weeks and swiftly let us know it was in his possession and could soon be in her's). the Harley Quinn figure from B:TAS - the harder to find one - found it here. one of the Neutrinos from TMNT - here too.Dave keeps an exhaustive but well organized and well curated selection of toys and figures in his relatively small space - and he uses it well! The store is packed from literally floor to ceiling with mostly still on card or in box wares and for the more adventurous and less picky, he has large bins of used figures with scuffs and scratches for a couple bucks a piece.What I really appreciate though is Dave's particular attention to what each person who walks into his store is looking for. In my case, he knows my sweet tooth for anything from B:TAS as well as figures from the mid 80's Kenner produced DC Super Powers line (the holy grail of super hero toy lines!) and has made a point to set figures aside for me until I've been able to come in and pick them up.With service that personalized and selection that solid, how on earth can you go wrong?

I have been here 4 times prior to writing this review, only to give them a chance to redeem themselves but surely no luck throughout any of the visits. There is only ONE lady, which is the owner, that does the pink & white french gel and she is absolutely horrible. She did not make the white gel even, so I had some fingers where the white was extremely thin, some fingers where it was way too thick, and some medium which I had originally wanted. I pointed out all the unevenness and she blamed my finger nails for not being the same length! I was extremely upset because at first she didn't want to fix any of the whites and so I showed ALL the other salon ladies and they ALL agreed it looked horrible and had to be fixed. This really embarrassed her, being the owner and all, so she tried to fix it but ended up hurting me and making me bleed on several fingers using the machine filer. She ended up shaving the white down, but then she didn't refill the white with some fingers so there were patches of my normal nail color that could be seen through the white. My girlfriend was with me and she just kept remarking on horrible it looked in front of the owner, but the owner didn't even care. The fingers where the white was too thick, she kept using a filer and filing down the white, which made my nail SO SHORT, she made my skin bleed and she didn't care. I WAS FURIOUS. Finally, she didn't file/shape down my nail so it looked like clunks of gel were on top of my nails, really really thick. On top of that, she charged me the FULL PRICE and wouldn't give me a discount, in which I am disputing now with my credit card! As for the pedicures, I have done several here with each person and I do not like how most of them do the pedicures. They do not use 2 coats of the white, only 1 coat so it chips right away. Literally, the SAME DAY. All the other pedicures I have done, they use 2 coats and they last for a long while. A few times I have asked the ladies to use 2 coats and they either said no we don't use 2 coats, or no and give me a nasty look like I'm crazy. There is one girl that does use 2 coats but she makes the white curve REALLY curvy when she shapes it so it looked weird. Lastly, for some reason they don't use a super shine top coat, so it gets dull after a day or 2. It seems like people rave about this place, but only for REGULAR manicures & pedicures. There's a reason why it's so cheap.", "rating": "1", "date": [2010, 6, 17]}, "29": {"description": "I wish I had a better review for this place. So, I went on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I wanted a pedicure and no-chip. I was excited cause they use Gelish, which I think is the best of the gel no chip polishes. They have A TON of colors. My pedicure was gorgeous. Perfect length, shape and color. And a really nice massage, nothing too hard or soft. The woman who did my feet used her time efficiently (took about 30 minutes) while still being thorough and careful, so I figured it would translate to my manicure. 1. The length of my fingernails was all off. She filed some too low and others were more squared off at the edges. Then, came the application of the polish. She put TWO layers of base coat on. I've never seen anyone do this before. So, I was surprised and a little worried. Then came the color. I kid you not, she went back and layered it on FOUR TIMES. Now, if you get no-chip, you know that the whole point is for your nails to look natural. Not in this case, they were thick and uneven and bumpy. because she kept going back and putting on more color, the manicure took TWO and a HALF HOURS. It was unbelievable. I was so frustrated and bored sitting there. I saw two episodes of Monk and that was torturous. Normally, after you go under the light for about 10 minutes or so, you should be completely dry. To my dismay, when I arrived home, I realized there were some streaks of color on my coat and on my sweats. There were big puddles of still-wet color in my nail beds. \u00a0So, I called to tell them I needed to come back and have them fixed. They were very nice and said I could come in the next day. Overnight, the color started completely coming off four of my nails. The color was bubbling and catching on clothing and just stripping off my nail. So, I figured I would go in during my lunchbreak cause if I went to see someone who actually knew what they were doing, it would take less time, right? WRONG. It took another 90 minutes for another very nice and seemingly competent technician to fix FOUR nails. She asked if I could stay to have all of my nails fixed but I just didn't have time. Again, she was very nice but she did seem to once again put two coats of base on and it took a REALLY long time to dry. It seems like that might be a problem? Anyhow, I'll not be back here, which is too bad because it's afforable ($48 for no chip and spa pedicure) and it's convenient.

Decades later, I still stop by when I get the chance.This location is located a few blocks West of the Dan Ryan Expressway, right next to a viaduct. \u00a0The first thing you see are the 55-gallon plastic drums that have been converted to garbage cans. Next, if it's summertime, you notice the customers lining up, and the yellow sign lining the top of the building. The first thing you smell are the onions. \u00a0The ever-present, wonderful onions that have been cooked as much as a thing could possibly be cooked. There is a parking lot, but often cars will park right in front of the business curbside, so they can grab their food to go. \u00a0This is a 24hr restaurant, and there is often great people watching to be had late night, especially on weekends. \u00a0I will be up front with you, this isn't the best food you will ever have. \u00a0Odds are you will still be tasting the onions \u00a08-12 hours after you eat here. However, if you want to see and eat where real Chicago people eat for a good price, it's hard to beat. Hot DogsIt's a hot dog. \u00a0There is no snap to the outer casing, and it's probably cooked a little too long. \u00a0The bun is standard, probably the cheapest ones the owner could find. \u00a0The hot dog is topped with mustard and as many over-grilled onions as you can stand. Ketchup is optional, french fries come with it. Despite the way my review sounds, I love these hot dogs! \u00a0I eat 20-40 hot dogs from this location a year. Fast and cheap, you can eat these while you drive, walk, or work. \u00a0Ask for hot peppers if you want to spice up the dog. \u00a0These are not sport peppers, these are HOT peppers, be aware.French FriesNot the best you've had, far from the worst. \u00a0They are always hot and fresh. \u00a0French fries come with every item they serve so the odds of you getting old, or cold french fries is non-existent. \u00a0They give you a decent amount, and if you're really low on cash an order of Fries for $1 will keep you alive. \u00a0I once asked for grilled onions on top of the fries and had my own little animal-style (in-n out burger) party.Pork chop sandwichInconsistent, sometimes dry, sometimes juicy, bone in awesomeness. Cooked on the griddle, placed on a hamburger bun and covered with grilled onions (of course), the pork chop is a decent size and is the true star of the sandwich.. I still order these now and again, but because they are more expensive than the hot dogs, they have fallen out of favor with me.Breakfast SandwichThe great this about places like this is that they never change, so when they introduced their breakfast sandwich a few years ago I was skeptical. \u00a0That said, late night breakfast is one of my favorite things to indulge in after a night of drinking, so I decided to give it a try. The breakfast sandwich consists of 2-3 eggs scrambled along with roughly chopped bacon. \u00a0This delightful mixture is then placed atop a hamburger bun, where a slice of American cheese can be added (.50 extra). To sum it all up: you can still get an affordable,cheap, delicious (mostly) meal relatively quickly. \u00a0Of course the food, clientele and cleanliness isn't the best, that's part of its charm. \u00a0It is a Chicago institution, and I wouldn't have it any other way.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 2, 3]}, "38": {"description": "For all its supposed South Side lore I didn't find this to be that great.

There is a parking lot connected so drive by, get a quick order, and head out if you want. I've had everything but a hot dog here so let me give you my thoughts on some of the items:Pork chop sandwich - Probably the one item you need to get if you come here. There is a bone-in and a no-bone option. People are gonna hate on me for saying you should get the no-bone version, but what is a big piece of bone every doing in your sandwich? You gotta take the whole thing apart, it gets messy, and just isn't worth it. The chop is juice and tastes great with the mustard and onions.Polish - Good stuff here too. You get that nice snap from the polish casing. Can't go wrong. Not the best polish, but very doable.Double cheeseburger - Why do a single if you can do a double? Lots of cheesy goodness and a really health size. The cheese can overwhelm the patties, but that might not be the worst thing in the world, right?All in all, good place to great a quick bite. Opened 24/7! It's really greasy so I can only come here once in a blue moon, but I'm always happy when I come.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 11, 6]}, "18": {"description": "What is there really to say about Maxwell Street Depot that hasn't been said about Johnny O's on 35th? \u00a0I do like this place, but it misses the mark on the neighborhood staple vibe. \u00a0Obviously it's amazing when stumbling back home at 3 AM in the public transit desert of Bridgeport, but I wouldn't go out of my way in the day to come here. \u00a0The plus side is they do have a small parking lot and because they're take-out only, things move quickly. \u00a0It's not much different from the other locations in the city.

However, they loose points for only having fries available to go with it instead of some kind of hashbrowns or oven Brown's.

A great cup starts from the source and it doesn't get better than the fresh stuff.Their Hardscrabble Blend is what they use for all of their espresso drinks. While I don't have the most refined coffee palette to characterize flavors profiles and point out nuances of this-and-that, I know what good coffee tastes like and bad coffee tastes like. I brought home a few bags of beans which ran about $13/bag. They have superb seating. Ample indoor and outdoor tables. They also have a back room if you prefer more privacy. My favorite aspect about this place aside the coffee is their elevated indoor seating area and tons of natural light. They have a '2nd floor' of sorts for their window seats. It. Is. Amazing. Major kudos to whoever decided this was a good idea--because it is. In additional to coffee & nice seating, they have a selection of usual foods to snack on: baked goods, sandwiches, bagels, etc. For breakfast, I went with a toasted multi-grain bagel with hummus.

Bridgeport Coffee has an antique and almost home-y like feel. They're not going for the pretentious hipster vibe rather a cozy hipster one. They're not aloof or intimidating. They simply serve up fine cups of hot coffee--freshly ground and roasted in-house. I am such a sucker for independent coffee shops that source & roast their own coffee. A great cup starts from the source and it doesn't get better than the fresh stuff.Their Hardscrabble Blend is what they use for all of their espresso drinks. While I don't have the most refined coffee palette to characterize flavors profiles and point out nuances of this-and-that, I know what good coffee tastes like and bad coffee tastes like. I brought home a few bags of beans which ran about $13/bag. They have superb seating. Ample indoor and outdoor tables. They also have a back room if you prefer more privacy. My favorite aspect about this place aside the coffee is their elevated indoor seating area and tons of natural light. They have a '2nd floor' of sorts for their window seats. It. Is. Amazing. Major kudos to whoever decided this was a good idea--because it is. In additional to coffee & nice seating, they have a selection of usual foods to snack on: baked goods, sandwiches, bagels, etc. For breakfast, I went with a toasted multi-grain bagel with hummus. Not sure where they get their bagels from but it was good! Not a lame Sara Lee bagel from the grocery store that's for sure. :D 5 stars for Bridgeport coffee.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 4, 23]}, "5": {"description": "In the last year, this place has gone way downhill.

As you walk in, you immediately are presented with a giant GI Joe diorama to the right in the front window, and a ride-able Battle Cat from Masters of the Universe.

A collector himself, he is honest and really cool to just talk to -- he's even pointed me in the direction of online toy stores when he didn't have the products I was looking for.

That's dedication!I also enjoy the fact that alot, if not all, of the toys they have are from donations. Its really cool to think that these old toys that we get have basically been saved from either staying in a basement somewhere, or saved from the trash.All in all, the only thing I can knock !Ka-pow!! on is the fact that they have SO MUCH stuff, I can never see everything, but that is no knock at all!

I don't really recommend for tons of people to shop here. Why? because unless you are into thrift shopping, then ok. I notice that stores like Target, and Walmart sell new stuff for just as cheap, or less. I don't shop so much at Walmart as I do at Target. Unique thrift store? it's pretty cool. This store is located in a little strip mall. It's actually built right on the very spot that was once a Dominick's supermarket way back in the 1970's. McGuanne park is right next to it. There is a Walgreens next door, a McDonalds, Little Ceasar's pizza, and other strip mall stores.

Pretty standard dollar a minute sort of deal. I agreed, and was led back to one of the rooms to undress. The table shower thing was pretty awesome. I didn't know how to feel being treated like a piece of dirty meat to be hosed down and disinfected for her petite Asian hands. For some reason she concentrated on my posterior assets and the divide.

Felt weird feelings of regressing to infancy in the strong, confident hands loofa-ing me up.The massage itself was rather lackluster. It was quite \"sensual\" as one of the other women reviewers mentioned. Again, I was treated to backdoor antics and showered with compliments. Really know how to flatter a guy, these masseuses.

I experienced the same thing and was quite put off by their pushy demeanor. Even breaking into Cantonese and giggling to another masseuse between hasseling me for a tip.

I know the ins and outs of braidings, surprise charges, and anything you can think of. \u00a0Since I'm new to the area I tried Eva out because of the good reviews on yelp. Here are brief reasons of all the things that went wrong (this is really brief there is more detail to it) :1. She canceled my appointment that I made 5 days in advance the day before. And she did not call me to tell me. I called her to confirm. She agreed I was still good for Sunday. She called me back later and said can I change for next week. So I had to were my hair out for a week. 2. She quoted me $180 for small individual braids that reach the bra strap. I was very specific with her about what I wanted because I hate surprise charges when you get there. Sure enough that's what happened.The lady said it was $200 and up for what I wanted. I told her no Eva said $180 and never have I paid more than $180 for them. I called Eva and she did not answer. To avoid the hassle, I agreed to the 200. 3. They did not have the \u00a0hair color I wanted. I asked Eva what type of hair she uses and if she had the color I wanted. If she didn't have it, it wouldn't have been a problem I would have just bought my own. She didn't know what type of hair she used but was sure she had plenty of dark brown. I get there they only had black and light brown. They lady says they never order dark brown. 4. The braids were not done correctly. the lady doing the back of my hair kept doing it wrong. She was making them big. so the braid would start off fat and then skinny on down. Also, she started the braid off in plaits, so if you wanted to do a ponytail you couldn't make one. The parts were huge, so they can rush through it. 5. They kept talking about my hair and the whole price situation in their language. since it was of french dialect I understood a lot of it. They also said to do it bigger since I was only paying $200. 6. My scalp was itching for about 2-3 weeks. I have no idea why. 7. They left small pieces of my hair out. In different areas, also. 8. After 4 weeks, my hair is untangling, frizzy at the end, and a mess. I'm trying to make it to six weeks. \u00a0Seriously, since the day I got it done I've been keeping it in french braid because it did not look good out. Positives: the place is clean.

She listened to what \u00a0I wanted and ensured I had a good experience. She engaged me in conversation and allowed me to watch TV. Eva did my braids her self, but it took much longer than I would have liked. She charged me $180 for senegalese braids, and did them long (which I liked at first). After a few weeks I thought there were a little too long for me, and especially heavy on my neck. I knew the next time I went I would get them a \"natural\" length that will make it easier for washing and general upkeep. Also, she had a credit card machine which made it much more convenient. Positives: neat, meticulous, clean shop, decent pricing, credit card machine, braids lasted for about 5monthsNegatives: took over 7 hrs, braids were too long, I had to curl the ends myself. 2nd experience: Over the phone I was told that the same braids would be $200 now since they do them long, when I asked about adding color, she said she had the color I wanted. Since I didnt want them long, I asked if it would be less, she said yes. Upon getting there, and reminding her about the color, she brought out a auburn color, and not a burgundy red like I initially asked for! I didnt even know what the color was until they started towards the front of my head (my mistake) so I went with it anyway. At the end of the day it turned out nice, but I still wished it was a little darker. This time she also called in someone to help (thank God!) so that was a plus. She asked me the length and i said (like yours) at the time her braids were shoulder length. Not paying any attention, I noticed that they kept adding hair. She also told me the price would still be $200! WHAT! ok so now you are doing them long and I asked for shoulder lenght, and you are still charging me more.. hmmm!When it was all said and done, she curled them this time. Ok cool. when it came time to pay, I handed her my check card. She looked at me like I was crazy and said \"we dont take that anymore, you can go to the atm across the street.\" Umm no, Im not paying a fee to take money out when you never told me you dont take cc until now! so I found an atm from my bank about a mile away and told her I wuold be back. She then asked me if it was ok if her helper would ride with me (ok what so now you think im not coming back, I would have left collateral). Fine! So I go to get the money and came back and gave it to the girl and dropped her off. WHAT AN INCONVENIENCE.

She said I was early even though I was only five minutes early and she left and said shed be back because she needed to buy some hair. Ok. She didnt come back quickly and instead a coworker came and said Eva told her to come see me, this was about twenty five minutes after my scheduled appt. I was hesitant because I only knew Eva was good, which was why I made an appt to see her, but let her coworker proceed to just make things easier. The woman seemed nice but took all the twists out that she was redoing at once which meant she would have no way of comparing the size of the originals with the new ones. When Eva finally came back she first ate dinner and then joined in (but left after maybe an hour and let the other woman finish the job). I wasnt uncomfortable as they were twisting and wasnt sitting in front of a mirror so I just trusted that they were doing a good job. It also took long enough for me to assume that they werent skimping and making the twists bigger than the originals to save time. Boy was I wrong! When they were finally done and I Iooked in the mirror I saw the new twists were noticeably bigger than the old. Awesome. I was told that this was done so that my natural hair wouldnt come undone like had been happening with the old twists. Since there was nothing I could do but try to make more of the hair match I asked if I could come back and have them touch up more for a better look. I was told thatd be fine but when I called I never got a call back. Funny thing is the twists they just did are already unraveling and I also now have tiny white bumps around the front of my scalp.

At first I had a very good experience. They had reasonable prices, a clean work space, and different styles. They were usually late but their service made up for that and I just began to arrive later. Last year I began my journey to healthy hair after a lot of heat damage and \u00a0did twist out styles mainly. About a month ago i decided it was time for my big chop and wanted to do protective styles for a while so my hair could grow more. The day after I cut 70% of my hair off I go to Eva. When I got there, We would always discuss a little before on the length I wanted. Then some other lady, who is not as skilled as Eva, started on my hair. She didn't ask me what length I wanted (I also forgot to tell her so its a fault on both sides) so about 1/5 of the way through I remember and say that I want the braids bra length. She then had an attitude (rightfully so). My mother and I offered to help take them out so she could start again but she just kept doing the waist length and ignoring all of our requests.Finally she finished my hair and it looked awful. The ends were terrible, they had little knots on the end (which i've never seen them do before), they were still a little longer than i liked but I didn't want to complain anymore. Right when I was about to leave, Eva walks into the store and I tell her about the incident. She tells me that if they unravel I can come back and she'll redo them no cost. Of course the next day they unravel, and I have to go back two days later. When I go back they redo the front and back and did it very roughly. The hair still didn't look good when they redid it because they braided it halfway down and the other half was straight because they wanted to save time. I ended wearing it in a bun for about a month and a couple weeks. I am not going back!

The person who was supposed to do my hair arrived late, which I would have been fine with if my hair had been done well. I repeatedly said that I didn't want my hair braided too tightly because I had experienced \u00a0SIGNIFICANT hair loss in the past from braids that were done too tightly. I said this repeatedly and I had indicated that I wanted the hair to go just slightly past my shoulders. None of this was heeded and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the braids aren't done evenly. They're made to be fat at the beginning and skinny towards the end. Maybe this is a style and the stylist didn't know what I meant when I said that I'd wanted box braids that were a little less then a pencil in diameter. I used to get my hair braided back in the 90s before some of the newer styles came in and I'm not familiar with all the things they do these days, so I really tried to give the hair dresser the benefit of the doubt.When I mentioned \u00a0the uneven size of the braids to the person doing my hair, the lady at first tried to deny it but then added more hair to the length as she went on. So by the end of the sitting I just wanted to be done and out. She trimmed off the stray hair (which wouldn't have been necessary if the hair length had been uniform) and she went about it very vigorously so I was terrified that she had cut some of my natural hair. At this point, I really was just tired and wanted to get out so I paid 200 even though I was quoted 180 and just got out of there. So now, here I am 3 months later (I've been busy with work so I couldn't take it out sooner) and low and I'm finding cut out bits of my curly hair mixed in with the braids.

The bartender told me that it is an original Brunswick Balke-Collender bar. Now to many of you who are not antique buffs- this may not mean much- but Brunswick went from making billiard tables in the 1880's to making these amazing back bars right here in Chicago. This one, and most others like it had to be built on site as the scale would be such that it would never fit through the door.. They were made of ornate woods and included specialties like stained glass, silvered mirrors and other ornamentation. An absolutely stunning piece of history. The walls and ceiling in Shinnicks are the original tin. And those walls are covered in old photographs of the Shinnick family and their friends, including past politicians. There is even a small sign that dubs this place \"little city hall\" making me think about what kind of politics went on in this place over the years. The bartender, Joanne, is a Shinnick, whose family has owned this bar since 1938. She is quick with the drink and on this busy Friday night was amazing as she served her friends and neighbors (and me) cheap beer and shots. This is not a fancy place so if you go- know to order a beer or a shot as those \"cosmos\" have no place here. Drinks are cheap, beer is handed to you in a bottle (or can during the Sox games) and cash is king at this place so also remember to leave the credit cards at home. And the people? They are so friendly. Within minutes I had run into someone I knew, met a woman who had just opened her new business and invited me to stop by, and had another person ask me if I was new to the neighborhood. I am always blown away by the friendliness of the south side. A bit hard to find but once you are there- you will be welcomed like you have lived in the neighborhood your whole life.

We inquired about drinks or drink specials and the girl said that pbr was $2 and :::looks at the tap with finger moving from side to side while she decides what to call the special for the day::: Fat tire pints are $4... score! I'll take that. The sandwiches took a while and we all got them one by one since the lone girl was the only one working.

The bread it was on was tasty and hearty, the cheese was thick and cooked just the way I like it, and the Dijon mustard layer killed it (in a good way). My sandwich with just cheese and mustard was $3.50 and it cost $1 to add the veggies and it came with delicious spicy paprika chips... I loved it.

As the nail technician prepped my nails to be painted, I noticed that the equipment used for my nails were sealed in a package. It indicated to me that they take cleanliness very seriously and I like the fact that they sterilize their equipment between each client. The nail technician was very gentle and did not rush the process. She took care in pushing back and cutting my cuticles. She made sure that I was satisfied with the tips of each nail before curing them under the UV light.Afterwards, she had brought me back to get my eyebrows and upper lip waxed. She made sure that all stray hairs were plucked and that my eyebrows were perfect before I left. She made sure the wax was not too hot. She was very quick and made the waxing painless.Overall, I had a great experience and will visit this business sometime in the future.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 2, 3]}, "5": {"description": "This is my second time coming in, I got an acrylic set and came back for a fill in 2 weeks later and Ici did an amazing job!

Firstly let me qualify this by saying it wasn't the food, it was a service issue. Guess what, please bring back using a little pad to write stuff down because if you can't remember it, getting the order wrong doesn't cut it.Our order, for starters an order of cheese curds, from the starter menu. Italian fries, from the starter menu (asked to be served later with out burgers)Two burgers, medium rare we picked the side salads instead of fries since we had our special fries coming with the burgers.So it seemed to be taking awhile for the curds, I see one order go by, then another dropped at the bar and the another two tables over. When I flag down the waitress to ask, she says that she's waiting for the fries to come up with them. I asked why, and she said well the fries are on the starter menu and you get fries with the burger. I said, huh? You get fries and the side salad? I thought it was a choice. She then says, oh yeah that's right. Then I remind her that we asked for the fries with the burger.She runs off to check on things, and comes back with our Italian fries, and then informs us that they are out of the cheese curds. Okay WTH? If they weren't served to three other tables first and as our \"starter\" which it should have been. Then my husband points out that our fries will be cold by the time the burgers come. A bell rings in the distance and she says, that has to be your burgers. Well with that logic then what are these fries, not really the starter she thought to begin with.The thing that really tics me off more than them being out of the cheese curds and the order getting screwed up, was the way she tried to finagle her way out of screwing up the order, first she ignored that we did ask for the fries to be served with the burgers and did it again when she didn't know the menu, since you don't get fries and a side salad. Or did she forget we ordered the side salads. She tried to make me think I didn't know what and how we ordered. As someone that did the job for years, I know how to move things around on a menu. Matter of fact I don't think this is a big deal at all.It's simple, we all make mistakes, I used to be a server and I've had to do the hold your breath, \u00a0apologize, admit making a mistake, and make it right. She did none of this, I even pointed out the logic of it as we went along. No apology or even let me get you a beer for the order being so screwed up, my guess is doing this would alert the manager that someone was very dissatisfied with the service. We had a Groupon for the meal, we didn't even use it, we just wanted to get out quickly, she must have wanted the same. We did ask for the check and I wanted to finish the last of my beer, that glass was whisked away along with the basket of fries that my husband was working on.The burgers were ordered medium rare, mine had a tiny bit of pink but my husband said his was well done and even a bit brunt on the end. He went on to say he would have sent it back if all the other stuff wasn't going on.

After expressing our frustration a few times, we finally received or food, the majority of which was wrong. Then only a few minutes after receiving it, the manager returned to our table and demanded that we provide a credit card to hold our order and essentially assumed that we would leave without paying. When was the last time you were seated at a restaurant and then asked to pay for your food after you took the first bite? I won't go into the details, but every rational conversation we tried to have after that about the service we received was met with angry remarks and unnecessary condescension. We did not want to leave gratuity, (and there was nothing on the menu or signage stating that it was mandatory for large parties) but did so after the manager hailed down the cops. We had no choice since we were powerless. I live in Chicago, but am not from here so this experience has taught me what many have warned me about. It's a city of segregated neighborhoods and if you go into a neighborhood business outside of your normal jurisdiction, you will likely be met with hate and disrespect depending on the color of your skin. We were not welcome there and so will obviously never go back, but this is not the way it should be. We were a group of young, black, educated men and women who only wanted what everyone else in the restaurant received. But honestly...we never stood a chance.

Food took close to an hour to come out with no update on when we'd get it. We only ordered burgers and tater totts and a couple of chicken wraps. When asked for an update, the response was \"well you guys placed a big order...\" No apologies, no time estimate, no customer service. I've gotten faster service at an outdoor family barbecue. 2.

And the burger came out in less than 5 minutes. Do they make burgers one at a time?4. Midway through the meal the manager came out an asked for a credit card because we had a large party. Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you supposed to open a tab for lunch? And we weren't seated at the bar.5. The manager, (bald and heavy set) added a gratuity to large party and TAXED THE GRATUITY.

So if I seem confused by certain things, that's why. I have been to Mexican restaurants occasionally, but I have a lot of trouble telling the difference between things. It all seems to be \"flour tortilla filled with stuff.\" I am not culturally insensitive. I am just inexperienced.Tacos Erendira is a Mexican restaurant that probably serves genuine Mexican food. But I don't have enough experience to say that it really is genuine.First of all, the place is cash only. Which bugs me. But maybe you don't care. They do have an ATM inside, but I had cash, so I don't know what kind of fee it carries. I ordered the combination plate. It consisted of three things. One was an enchilada, one was a tostada, and one was a tamale. At least according to the menu. It also had refried beans and rice. The rice was good and well cooked. That I can judge. I know good rice. And the meat and various innards of the foods were tender and flavorful. Everything was very good. One of the things - according to my research, the tamale - came wrapped in what was clearly a corn husk. This is not something I knew was a thing. So, be warned that some items may be contained in inedible matter. Fortunately, I had a good connection on my smart phone and was able to research whether I was supposed to eat the corn husk. If you have an unreliable internet service provider, you might want to give this place a pass or do some research beforehand about what parts of what foods should not be eaten. In addition to my plate of food, they also brought me two bottles. One contained green fluid. One contained red fluid. I don't know what those are called, but I can say both are spicy. The red one is less spicy. The green has no flavor apart from being spicy. I did not care for either one, but I'm not as tolerant of spicy foods as I used to be. Call me a wimp, but I've gradually come to the conclusion that I don't want food that hurts my mouth to eat.Long story short: if you are looking for food that tastes good and includes meat options like steak and chicken and ground beef and includes flour tortilla and various vegetables and sauces, you'll probably like this place. Especially if you like occasionally being surprised by some of your food being hidden inside inedible stuff like a birthday present. And if you like red and green spicy fluids, you'll probably also like this place. But, if you're looking for an authentic Mexican food experience, I really don't know how you'll feel. So maybe check another review by someone who has eaten far more Mexican food than I have.Oh, side note. This doesn't detract from the restaurant at all, but it's an odd detail I have to mention. There is a LOT of space in the restaurant. I mean, half the place is filled with slightly mismatched furniture that looks okay together. But there is also a lot of open, unused space in the middle of the restaurant. It seemed weird. And the hallway in the back that leads to the bathrooms is also really long and passes A LOT of doors. It just seems like the restaurant is way bigger than it needs to be.

I went to George's to get some hot dogs. And I am still confused and a little frightened by what happens to hot dogs in this city. Personally, I am used to a naked hot dog to which I add one or two condiments at most. Mustard, for example. Or chili. Or, if I'm feeling very saucy, chili AND cheese. I don't even know if this city HAS chili dogs. My point is, I got two hot dogs \"with everything.\" And they were good, but they were still alien to me and I have no baseline for comparison. They were well-presented and all the ingredients appeared to be fresh and everything was cooked to the right consistency, so objectively, they were good hot dogs. But subjectively, I have no real baseline for comparison. I can't say how good or how bad they were compared to other hot dogs that have been buried under a pile of vegetables and condiments with an entire dill pickle spear in there to keep it company. So, take my opinion of the actual hot dogs with a grain of celery salt. Which, by the way, George's didn't seem to include. But, as I understand it, there's a big debate as to whether celery salt is necessary for a proper Chicago dog. And I don't even know what celery salt is. So I just mention it as a fact. If celery salt is a vital ingredient in your hot dog, I don't think they included it.What I can say is that it's a spacious, clean restaurant on south Halstead with a friendly staff. They make the food to order, they are quick, and they bring it to your table. The French fries are not amazing, but they are tasty enough. The hot dogs, I am not sure about, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph. And they have a whole lot of other foods available too. Burgers, tacos, gyros, the usual grilled fast-food made-to-order fare. It is also within convenient walking or biking distance of my apartment, but I realize that's probably not a useful quality for anyone who doesn't live in the same building as me. But maybe you live on a nearby street and this is helpful to know. The best part though is the prices. The food is really affordable and good value. Two hot dogs, french fries, and a can of soda or pop or whatever you people call it in Chicago for $5.50. Their other prices seem to be in the same ballpark. So a person can eat a good meal for under $10.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 10, 7]}, "24": {"description": "Best Gyros in the City and very cheap.

The main reasons I love coming here is :1.) She is a professional. For a service at this price point, you want someone who knows what they are doing. Extensions is what she does all day every day of the week.2.) I did my research, and this beauty boutique consistently (over many years) has happy, repeat customers--myself included now. She has an excellent track record for good quality hair extensions that last and look natural. 3.) I leave looking like I have celebrity hair! It's not too over the top (very natural. In fact, no one has ever suspected my hair was not my own in the 10 months I had them on).My most recent experience: This was my third application of a klix hair extensions with Lesley. I came back after enjoying my full head of beautiful hair extensions for a little over 3 months. I originally decided to get hair extensions because I wanted more volume and and a dramatic change in length. I love that these extensions do not use glue or tape for application, which has caused extensive damage to my hair in the past. \u00a0I also love my klix extensions, becuase I can treat them as I treat my normal hair....I wash them regularly, dye them, and get them blown 2-3 times a week.Removal is a breeze; . After removal, which took maybe 20 minutes, my natural hair looked great still (healthy and as full as it was before I had extensions, what a relief!)! I had a new set of klix extensions applied, and I love them!Lesley is the BEST hands down! She's extremely experienced, does such an amazing job, and truly knows her stuff. She's smart and detail-oriented. I am soooo happy to have found herMy advice to those who try extensions, make sure you take care of your hair investment! Brushing and caring for them will let you enjoy them for a long time and your natural hair will not be damaged from matting/tangling! Mine definitely will last longer this time around now that I'm experienced with caring for them.*******************************************************************************************************************I see Lesley for hair extensions....which is why I decided to go for the eyelashes too!That's it...I will say it...Lesley is the eyelash queen!!! \u00a0I will be with her for the long haul!It was my first time getting eyelash extensions and was a little scared on the whole process. She was so patient with me and explained the entire process and gave me tips on how to keep my lashes in great shape. The application was so relaxing too. She has done a great job with making her space so comfortable, clean and welcoming. Lesley as a person is so sweet, considerate and a true professional in her craft.

The employees at augustines are nothing like that. I feel comfortable to ask questions and if I'm looking for something specific they're always ready to help explore all options that fit my inquiries. They have a ton of potions and oils as well as a nice little book selection. They also hold small workshops and classes and offer cleansings for an extremely cheap price. Their prices are about the same as other similar shops on the city however they constantly have different deals and specials to take advantage of plus they'll occasionally throw in special little freebies here and there. This shop has become like a second home to me and I am definitely a loyal customer now. Their location is very convenient. You have to pay for street parking but you can usually find a spot almost right in front of the store. This is a special place filled with people who I could chat with for hours.

It didn't have the right mix of vinegars, sugar, and salt. It was almost undercooked.The fish itself (e.g., tuna, superwhite tuna, yellowtail, and salmon) was fishy and unpleasant. It was cut nicely, but something was just off in taste.Lastly, why is it more expensive to dine in than order from grubhub?

When it comes to Han 202, I think the answer is yes. I am absolutely shocked that this placed isn't packed night in, night out. A friend had been here for a wine dinner a few months ago, and from that visit several of us have been chomping at the bit to come here. So, knowing that they are BYO, a bunch of friends and I came down here for a wine dinner.We all started off with a piece of Tuna sushi. This was cut beautifully and was a great little amuse bouche starter. After the starter, we got into the real fun. I chose the lobster tail with red beet and star anise mayo. This was an excellent starting dish with a lot of \u00a0subtle complexity to it. My next two courses were the shrimp toast and duck breast with sichuan hot bean sauce. The shrimp toast was one of those dishes that has left me thinking about it days later. It sounds weird as shrimp toast is normally just an appetizer that is deeply fried at a lot of Chinese restaurants. Instead, this was turned into a real delight and stand alone dish. The duck breast was just as innovative and wonderful. The heat from the sauce was just right and the duck breast was beautifully done. I ended things with the walnut tart and ice cream. This had just the right amount of sweetness to it and was a great way to end things. I can't speak highly enough of Han 202. The experience was a home run at every point.

The menu has a very weak theme of \"Chinese fusion\", which in reality is a hodgepodge of traditional Chinese offerings and classical French/American dishes with the occasional Asian influence. The menu items are painfully conservative in nature and have no direction or vision. Execution is unacceptably subpar given the rudimentary nature of the technical errors. Unless you are fixated on the concept of prix fixe dining and don't want to break the bank, there really isn't much reason to go to Han 202.A quick summary of what I had:- \"Tuna Sandwich\" amuse-bouche: completely bland and the texture of the bread was between stale and toasted. I didn't see the point of starting the meal off with something so lifeless.- Smoked salmon salad: the salmon was far too salty and tasted like it might have come out of a package.- Salt & Pepper Calamari: the calamari was seasoned well and I enjoyed the onion/bell pepper garnish (despite my confusion with what the chef was going for here) but the squid was not cooked long enough and was visibly under-fried. Why not just leave it in there for another 30 seconds to make it golden brown?- Rack of Lamb: more issues with technique, as it was clear that the pan used to cook the lamb was not hot enough. No sear whatsoever on the meat, leaving a fatty and unappealing texture to the crust. The lamb was served at room temperature and the bonito plum sauce was a complete afterthought; I tasted neither components of the sauce.- Hot Chocolate Souffl\u00e9: this was the only satisfactory preparation of the night. Nice presentation as the souffl\u00e9 rose quite nicely, and the dish was not overly sweet.

The snow fell as giant crystals, as I parked on a side street and walked over. I met my friend out front. The curtains were closed. Afraid that we had caught Han 202 on a night that they were closed, I pulled on the door. It opened.The host and waitress gave warm hellos and sat us down near the kitchen (per our request to stay as far away from the bitter cold as possible). Besides, I always like sitting next to the kitchen so that I can look in and see the artists at work. After warming up with some hot tea, we ordered from the $35 prix fixe menu. My friend began with an arugula salad, which he said was quite good. I personally have never been a fan of arugula, so I went with another option (there were three): Octopus Terrine. It was at this point that I realized how blended the cuisine was. The delicious purple arms of the octopus had been stuck together with gelatin to form a slice. The taste was a little fishy, but mostly it was savory. It was a filling appetizer that I would likely get again.Next came out the first entree. After explanations of the dish by our hosts (a little to formal for my typical yelp cell pictures), we chowed down. My friend received Shanghai Dumplings that looked mouthwateringly good. My own platter was less memorable...seriously, I can't remember it, and I ate there less than a week ago. With that said, I do vaguely recall it tasting good, so there you go!Then, it was time for the main course. Upon our waitress' recommendation, we both had their take on filet mignon. It was amazing. The sweet taste of the Chinese sauce mixed well with the caramelized onions and perfectly cooked medium steak. For those of you less in love with red meat, there were not one but two different fish options on the menu. Finally, it was time for dessert and coffee. Of all the good cuisines that I had at Han 202, nothing surpassed the decadent, yet light taste of my Hot Chocolate Souffle. I just couldn't stop eating this dessert until each and every crumb had been expertly slurped up. I also indulged in an organic French-pressed coffee. It was a little on the pricy side ($6), but after a meal like that I'll forgive that standard practice of the restaurant industry. Verdict: Han 202 ended up truly impressing me.

The capers were perfect not to salty not to briny the dressing was perfect it went so well with everything nothing was overpowering really filling and delicious Second course- crab cake with chive and green apple: u have to pay an additional 8 dollars but that's okay because this was so good! Best crab cake I have ever eaten. It is so crunchy perfect texture and it's not greasy at all. There is so much crab meat in it like its all crab no filler. The inside filling is so good. The green apple on top was perfect because it's tart and it cuts through the richness of the crab cake.Diver scallop with white chocolate sabayon sauce. You have to pay an additional 8 dollars for this course. The scallop was supper tender not overlooked had great flavor. The white chocolate sauce was really good really sweet the problem was that this dish is too sweet it needs something spicy really acidic or something bitter to contrast the sweetness of the white chocolate because scallops are a little sweet on there own already so it needs something!Salt and pepper calamari with diced onion and bell pepper- I didn't get to taste this there was a lot of calamari like slot the bowl was filled my brother ate this in like two seconds n my mom got a bite n said she loved itThird course: miso marinated Chilean sea bass with root pur\u00e9e. You have to pay an additional 10 dollars. Every time I'm given to eat Chilean sea bass I do because it's supper expensive at the grocery store one of the best tasting fishes. The texture of the fish was perfect not over cooked supper tender. All the condiments on the dish went well with the fish nothing to over powering. The problem was the fish was a little to salty idk what it was maybe the chef added to much salt.Ribeye steak with red wine hoisin sauce. You have to pay an additonal 10 dollars for this course.

This is the most tenderest steak I have ever eaten it was cooked perfectly did not even need a knife to cut it.

When it comes to Han 202, I think the answer is yes. I am absolutely shocked that this placed isn't packed night in, night out. A friend had been here for a wine dinner a few months ago, and from that visit several of us have been chomping at the bit to come here. So, knowing that they are BYO, a bunch of friends and I came down here for a wine dinner.We all started off with a piece of Tuna sushi. This was cut beautifully and was a great little amuse bouche starter. After the starter, we got into the real fun. I chose the lobster tail with red beet and star anise mayo. This was an excellent starting dish with a lot of \u00a0subtle complexity to it. My next two courses were the shrimp toast and duck breast with sichuan hot bean sauce. The shrimp toast was one of those dishes that has left me thinking about it days later. It sounds weird as shrimp toast is normally just an appetizer that is deeply fried at a lot of Chinese restaurants. Instead, this was turned into a real delight and stand alone dish. The duck breast was just as innovative and wonderful. The heat from the sauce was just right and the duck breast was beautifully done. I ended things with the walnut tart and ice cream. This had just the right amount of sweetness to it and was a great way to end things. I can't speak highly enough of Han 202. The experience was a home run at every point. Add in that it's BYO, and you have a real winner. I can't wait for my next trip here.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 7, 28]}, "17": {"description": "Absolutely nothing to brag about.

Han 202 is a wonderful exception, especially for the price. We did the PRIS FIXE MENU ($35 for 4 plates plus a bonus starter). We brought our own beer (a bottle of wine looks nicer in the ELEGANT, MODERN ATMOSPHERE, but we just filled up our large wine glasses and they took the beer bottles). My husband had: bonus starter egg custard tartelette, shrimp dumpling (he skipped the salad, and substituted this for $5 extra), the shanghai dumpling, the Mongolian beef, and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and poached pear. I had: bonus starter egg custard tartelette, smoked salmon salad, shanghai (pork) dumpling, ma po tofu (with ground beef), and the walnut tart.WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING! Everything was a surprise and a delight. Elegantly served and arranged too.Some comments: ON THE TWO TYPES OF DUMPLING: two men (one being my husband) liked the soy-vinegar-ginger dipping sauce on the shanghai dumplings so much that they drank the rest of it from the little bowl (including mine!). I thought it was really good, but would have preferred a less vinegar-y sauce. Obviously subjective.We both loved our entrees. IF YOU LIKE SPICY DISHES, those are good ones to get! (Mongolian beef and ma po tofu with ground beef--perhaps you can ask them to omit the ground beef (?) if you are vegetarian).We both REALLY LIKED OUR DESSERTS too, though I found it hard to eat the walnut tart with a large, thick edged spoon...I had to use my finger to get it on the spoon as it kept just sliding across the plate. The spoon was too thick to slide underneath the pastry. Perhaps an extra fork would have helped. My husband also loved the souffl\u00e9 and pear, but I thought the souffl\u00e9 would be more nicely presented in a little dish, rather than a paper cupcake liner (a minor point). The walnut tart by the way has a lot of dried fruit in it--the flavor is mainly dried cranberry, raisin and perhaps something like candied orange peel.

It upsets me to see people vomiting false statements on their computer screen about an establishment that serves high quality food in a neighborhood peppered with Pall Mall smoking degenerates (I can say that because I live 2 blocks away.) Also, who gives a restaurant one star for not being open? Yelp needs to add a filter.My friend and I decided to do an early dinner here about two months ago. There isn't a parking lot but there is ample, or, INFINITE amount of street parking. Valet parking downtown is much more expensive then the $3.00 street parking - so fork up the measly $3.00. You're going to a fine dining restaurant and count your blessings for it not being located on Michigan Ave where no parking is available.We entered the establishment WITHOUT a reservation and was seated at a open table. You do NOT need reservations if you are there early enough, or, if there are no reserved tables - which isn't likely. I highly recommend getting reservations but they are not needed unless you feel like gambling on an open table. Again, not uncommon in fine dining restaurants.The BYOB is definitely an attractive quality so we decided to purchase a bottle of wine before our arrival. Our waitress proceeded to open the bottle promptly (no cork fee, no fuss whatsoever.) In fact, the waitress suggested pairings to the red wine we brought. I'm unsure of why reviewers state they won't open the bottle, and even if they just provide the bottle opener and do not open, it's not like you have to run the Iron Man triathlon. It takes all of 10 seconds.Onto the waitress, YES, they do stand at the far side of the room facing the tables - but they are not staring at YOU. They are staring at your tables to make sure you are comfortable or ready for your next course, refill of water..etc. I'm SHOCKED to hear people complain about this kind of service. This isn't a negative. If you're embarrassed about having a waitress or waiter see you cramming an entire duck down your gullet, then learn how to properly use your knife and cut your meal accordingly. My friend used the bathroom and left her napkin on the table so the waitress came over and folded it nicely and laid it back on the table then left. Curse you, fine dining!We ordered an appetizer, entree, our main courses and dessert. Each was equally good as the last. Some portions were small but rightfully so. I do not like my appetizer to be larger then the main course. My friend has a very sensitive palate and she concluded it was of very, very good quality. I personally thought it was spectacular. I'm sorry my detail isn't great but it has been a couple weeks and I can't seem to find the menu online (which would have jogged my memory.)I found the price to be reasonable, but after reading other reviews you'd think it's Alinea. You have to remember this is fine dining in a neighborhood used to pizza places and Italian beef stands - where apparently $3.00 parking breaks the bank. Expect to pay for quality food. That should go without saying.Overall, I'm very pleased by this establishment and look forward to going again. Be smart. Either go there early for a table or make a reservation. BYOB it. If you go all out with a party of two (appetizers, entrees, desserts) expect $90.00 bill without tip. Not bad for great food.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 6, 19]}, "33": {"description": "After reading many good reviews of Han 202, my friend and I decided to have dinner there last night. The evening started out with promise and we were seated immediately without reservations. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive and the food was good. The prix fixe menu price of $35 was clearly listed on the menu at the table and, though the reviews we read might have been older and touted the prix fixe at $25, we didn't mind the difference and stayed. We enjoyed our meal and when our server asked if we'd like coffee or tea with our dessert, we asked if they de-caf tea. Our server said they did not and offered de-caf coffee instead, which we agreed on. The coffee arrived a few minutes later, with each of us getting a one cup French press. The bill arrived and we each threw in a credit card and asked our server to split the bill and when we looked at the final amount on our tab, we had each been charged $45. Needless to say, we were surprised and wondered how a $70.00 bill became a $90 bill. I was flabbergasted to see that the coffee was $12!! Even Starbucks doesn't charge $6 for one small cup of coffee. (There was no price for coffee on their menu and all the teas were a reasonable $2.50-$3.00)I called our server over and asked about the charge (which was after our credit cards had been processed.) I explained that we were surprised by the price of the coffee and had we known we would be paying $12, we would not have ordered it. I was very nice to the server and I explained that we would like the owner or manager to remove at least one of the coffee charges. This is where the evening took a real dive for us. The server immediately shut down, stonewalling our effort to mollify the situation. She refused to adjust our bill, refused to pass along our request to speak to either the manager or owner and she said the owner was not there. When I asked who was the manager on duty, she said she was the manager. At this point, I was still being very reasonable and I explained that we enjoyed the meal and the service, and we didn't want to punish the waitstaff for the restaurant's issue. However, we explained that we would have no choice but to leave without adding a tip if the situation wasn't rectified. I asked one more time nicely and said, \"if you are the manager, you must have discretion over this.\" She said the owner would \"punish\" her anyway. My response was an incredulous, \"Really? You work for a guy that would be that abusive to his staff?\" She got a glassy look \u00a0and started to walk away. Since there was a pen on the table with the bill, I wrote a note to the owner, explaining why we left without leaving a tip, which I felt bad about. And, suggesting that he pass the $12 on to the waitstaff and eat the couple of bucks it cost him for the coffee. It's unfortunate when an otherwise good restaurant has horrible customer service skills. In any establishment, a customer complaint should be met with compromise and there was nothing offered in this situation. In the end, they suffered far more than a $12 loss. First, because the situation drew attention from nearby diners. We warned them of the price of coffee on our way out and suggested they pay close attention to their bill before throwing their credit card on the table. We said the same thing to the dozen or so people who were waiting in line near the door. In addition, I am writing this review, which may dissuade some folks from going, and in the end, I will NEVER go back and I will only have a bad memory and a reason to diss this place. It all goes to show that bad word of mouth spreads 100X faster than good word of mouth....that alone is enough to give away a cup of coffee.The pros: Efficient Service, ample portions, tasty food and good location with plenty of parking.The cons: Very noisy with no sound dampening, inflexible management with a really bad attitude.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 11, 24]}, "43": {"description": "Definitely a twist to the Chinese food I grew up with - and about time!

The tortas are a hit and miss affair, I must admit. \u00a0I think the bread was toasted nicely but the most recent one that I had was with their Milanesa (breaded steak) and I was not too impressed. \u00a0The sandwich was dry and the breaded steak was very unremarkable and borderline bland. \u00a0Now, the Al Pastor torta was a much better experience and the overall sandwich benefited from \u00a0it. \u00a0 Because the pork is more favorable and moist, the balance of the toasted bread and beans was balanced out by it. \u00a0I enjoyed it. \u00a0The cup of soup they give you when you come in is standard but pleasing fare. \u00a0I jazz it up a bit by adding a couple of spoons of that great salsa and it's another treat I enjoy. \u00a0Right now, as I type this, I am enjoying their Horchata in a huge \"to go\" cup. \u00a0I enjoy it greatly. \u00a0It's got a nice smooth flavor and is my second favorite (Tio Luis is the champ in this category) in the two neighborhoods I go to for easy access meals when I'm not out and about.", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 12, 9]}, "23": {"description": "So cheap, so much food, so good.yeeessss !", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 31]}, "47": {"description": "Taqueria la Mexicana is a little spot tucked into a building just west of Halsted on 35th.

On the night we were there- there were only two guys working the place, the cook and the \"jack of all trades\" guy who was the host, bartender, server and manager all at the same time. We were told to sit anywhere and chose a booth back in the corner. The menu has alot of options of menu combinations to single items to specials of the house with nothing over $10. Chips and salsa were put down in front of us and were replenished when needed. We also got some complimentary soup (sort of a pasta vegetable blend) all before we ordered. We chose simply; the Tostada combination for my friend and Tres Amigos for me (I wanted to try a little of this and that and this combo had three different items). We also ordered a beer and one of their highly touted margaritas. The food was quick to arrive and was just as quickly devoured. While tasty- I think we were both hungry enough that anything would have been quickly put away. As for the drinks? I say stick with the beer. The margarita had that overly sweet taste of a premade mix, and while strong and big (there are two sizes and the large is LARGE!) I didn't really care for it. This place is really reasonable. Dinner for two with drinks was only $28 and they take credit cards which is always a plus in my book!

Heard nothing but good about it and wanted to give it a try, so I stopped in for dinner.When I walked in, I was the only customer in there. The waitress came to me within a minute with a glass of water. She was really nice. I figured out pretty quickly I would want the enchilada dinner and a diet Pepsi. It came with 3 enchiladas, and I got 2 chicken and one cheese. The Pepsi was in a can, so no refills. (And $1.50 seems like a lot for a can of Pepsi) A few minutes after ordering, the waitress brought me some chips and salsa and a cup of some really delicious soup. Not sure if the soup came standard, like chips and salsa usually do, or if it was part of my dinner, like the beans and rice. But either way, I'm not complaining. Not long after, my dinner came out. That's when it started going downhill. The rice wasn't bad, but the refried beans left a bit to be desired. I love refried beans but didn't care for these. And there was something about the sauce on the enchiladas. It was different, and not exactly something to write home about. But even still, I ate until I was full, then was ready for a carryout box. I must have waited almost a half hour for my waitress to bring me a box, and that was because I finally found her to flag her down. For it being so empty, I thought it would have happened a bit sooner than that. But after I got my main dish, she never came back. Didn't even have my check yet. When she brought the box, I asked for a milkshake to take home. She was quick enough to bring my bill then. When I got my shake I finally paid my bill and left, and drank the shake on the way home. I bit into an ice cube while drinking it. I've since been told that shakes are sometimes made with crushed ice, which I didn't care for. I like them with milk and ice cream.

From charging you for chips and salsa (complimentary in 99% of other mexican restaurants) if you order anything they have on special to a couple of waitresses that seem bothered by your presence and having to take your order, I have run out of reasons to eat here any longer. But the very last time I went, I noticed they not only raised their prices on most things but on a few things the prices jumped by at least $1 or more, specifically their burritos. I'm sorry but I'm not paying $7 for a burrito just because one or two nearby places have decided to extort people with their prices as well and you think you are worth upscale pricing. I could go to countless other places (including one place just 4 blocks away), in much higher priced areas and still get a GOOD burrito for $6 or less. It's not even about the money, it's the principle. I know gouging when I see it. I think Taqueria La Mexicana has either begun to take themselves (and their food) too seriously and/or, they are on the verge of shutting down and are trying to pull as much profit as they can in the meantime.

It's unassuming but does have a couple of parking spots.There are a lot of Italian places in Bridgeport and this place's menu immediately reminded me of Ricobene's which is just about a mile away. I got the breaded steak sandwich for a direct comparison to Rico's famed breaded steak. Mangia's breaded steak is definitely a cleaner version compared to Rico's. The breading is good, meat is tasty, much less messy than Rico's and mozarella and hot peppers are a must. However, I still strongly prefer Rico's breaded steak. You get a lot more steak, hot peppers, cheese, and overall food at Rico's. Plus, I think Mangia's is pretty expensive. $13 for a not-so-big breaded steak with cheese and not-so-many peppers. I'd rather get a king-sized Rico's breaded steak for that price.Mangia's food is definitely tasty. So if you're not a gluttonous pig like me and enjoy a smaller meal, try Mangia's for sure.

I was out hunting for a good diner breakfast experience. And this place is a few blocks away. And that is exactly what it delivered. They have a good selection of omelettes. The first time I went, I tried a Hawaiian omelette, which I had never heard of and I'm pretty sure they made up. It had pineapple and ham and swiss cheese and the combination worked. I also tried a thing called potatoes O'Brien. I realize mixing Irish and Hawaiian might seem kind of strange. But I have two counter-arguments. First, macadamia nuts. Macadamia nuts, which now grow in Hawaii, were brought from Scotland by John Macadam. Now, Scotland is not Ireland. Not at all. But they are NEAR each other. So there's some precedent for mixing Hawaii with stuff from the islands north of Europe. Second, it's diner food. It's not like I'm mixing poi with blood pudding. It's an omelette and potatoes.Anyway, the second time I had a different omelette. It had spinach and feta cheese and roasted peppers. It was also good. The food is good. The coffee is good. The service is good. It's clean and pleasant. If you need a good little diner experience, that's exactly what is inside. Now, I have to call attention to one oddity. I am a native New Yorker and only recently moved to Chicago. So, maybe this is a Chicago thing. Or maybe it is just an idiosyncrasy of the the Bridgeport Restaurant. I don't know. Both of my omelettes arrived with this fist-sized, bright green spicy-hot pepper just sitting on the side of the plate. It was just there. I'm not sure why it was there. I am not even sure if I was expected to eat it or if it was purely decorative. I did try a piece and it was extremely spicy. It isn't for me. I've noticed that Chicago does have a habit of sticking spicy peppers on everything, so maybe it's not unusual. I don't know. I only mention it because it might be a selling point for you. If you've been looking for a good diner breakfast that also gives you a fist-sized, bright green, spicy hot pepper, this is it. You've found it. Go here. It's everything you want.

Star Kitchen is a new Asian fusion place in the Bridgeport area and I thought I'd give it a try.Right when I walked in I was skeptical already. It was a Sunday night and the take out shop was dead. The one person that was working seemed so surprised I walked in--he really did jump a little when he saw me. This is more of a delivery place so I gave it a pass. Then I asked to see the menu and the guy didn't speak English. That was fine for me, because I speak Cantonese (which was what he spoke) but I'm not sure how they do business. I ordered a Combo A and tried to used the 15% off check-in that they offer on the Yelp. He quickly said that it was not valid and after a few times of asking why not, he called who I assume is his boss who finally gave him the okay. The food was made pretty fast, I guess.Combo A is supposed to come with an egg roll, hot and sour soup, chicken fried riced, and orange chicken. The serve gave me the food and it didn't have any soup. So I asked if I could get some soup, but the server grabbed a soda and stuck it in the bag. I again asked him for a soup instead of a soda, but he really used his hands and shooed me away like a little kid.I get home try to give the food a chance, but the food was 2/5 just like the service. Looking at previous photos, they have really started to skimp on the food. I got a total of 4 piece of orange chicken. They were actually not bad, but seriously? 4 tiny pieces? The egg roll might actually just have been fried flour with some strands of cabbage inside. The rice was tasty but it was all from the grease they put.Chinatown is a mile away and 1000 miles better than this place. I get it, they are the late night option.

Years ago I used to go to Iffergan on Oak, after a few years of it not being convenient for me to get to I did find a new place close to home within walking distance, score! So I had been going to the same place for quite a few years now, and was very happy with them, but now I was faced with the same problem I moved and it's just difficult to get there, between my being on the other side of town and her being so popular I just can't seem to get there. So I need to make a change.As I said, change is hard and the first place I tried wasn't a good choice. I didn't review it since it would have been a one, maybe two star review and I don't think it would have been fair after one try, however I did sense that it wasn't going to work out.So here is the break down..The staff - Very friendly, being that I was in the area I decided to walk in to schedule my appointment, as I started to walk past the window (door is on the side) the receptionist and I made eye contact and she gave me a smile, at this point there was no way for her to know I was even headed in. Today when I came in there were different people at the front desk, but they were just as friendly.The salon - Clean and inviting, they did offer me a beverage, the place is well laid out.Liz - One of the owner's and my stylist today. Friendly and informative, she took the time to listen to what went wrong with my last cut, without being being judgmental, we even both agreed that it can take more than one time to get the feel of someones style. \u00a0Perhaps this is true, however I do think it's a listening skill, because she nailed it in one try, I had this same experience with where I used to go too. She did an excellent cut, I love it, better yet my husband loves it, since he has to look at it that's an important consideration to me. The color, she did a color blocking technique, also an excellent job. She made it look easy, that's the true hallmark of someone that has skills, people who are pros always make it look easy. Parking and the White Sox - I didn't find this to be a problem and my appointment was just about the same time the game started. Here's a hint, don't take 35th. all the way there, take Morgan and while you're on Morgan park south of 35th. and walk. There are no parking restrictions on Morgan, and south of 35th. no meters. Okay, so you have to walk two or three blocks, are you telling me that when you go to your Lincoln Park or Gold Coast salon you don't have to walk? If so you're living life right and have some good Karma going on.Area - Someone said \"dicey or sketch\" you're kidding right? You know you're in Chicago? Maybe you don't. \u00a0If you're worried about it CC is for you.Price/products- I didn't think the prices were out of line for the expertise. I'm a firm believer of you usually get what you pay for. I didn't feel pressured to buy anything, Liz showed me a couple of products at the end, and I explained that I have plenty now at home and I've been using Aveda products which she agreed that Aveda makes good stuff, there was no pressure.I'm very happy I gave them a try, and I'll be returning.

Years ago I used to go to Iffergan on Oak, after a few years of it not being convenient for me to get to I did find a new place close to home within walking distance, score! So I had been going to the same place for quite a few years now, and was very happy with them, but now I was faced with the same problem I moved and it's just difficult to get there, between my being on the other side of town and her being so popular I just can't seem to get there. So I need to make a change.As I said, change is hard and the first place I tried wasn't a good choice. I didn't review it since it would have been a one, maybe two star review and I don't think it would have been fair after one try, however I did sense that it wasn't going to work out.So here is the break down..The staff - Very friendly, being that I was in the area I decided to walk in to schedule my appointment, as I started to walk past the window (door is on the side) the receptionist and I made eye contact and she gave me a smile, at this point there was no way for her to know I was even headed in. Today when I came in there were different people at the front desk, but they were just as friendly.The salon - Clean and inviting, they did offer me a beverage, the place is well laid out.Liz - One of the owner's and my stylist today. Friendly and informative, she took the time to listen to what went wrong with my last cut, without being being judgmental, we even both agreed that it can take more than one time to get the feel of someones style. \u00a0Perhaps this is true, however I do think it's a listening skill, because she nailed it in one try, I had this same experience with where I used to go too. She did an excellent cut, I love it, better yet my husband loves it, since he has to look at it that's an important consideration to me. The color, she did a color blocking technique, also an excellent job. She made it look easy, that's the true hallmark of someone that has skills, people who are pros always make it look easy. Parking and the White Sox - I didn't find this to be a problem and my appointment was just about the same time the game started. Here's a hint, don't take 35th. all the way there, take Morgan and while you're on Morgan park south of 35th. and walk. There are no parking restrictions on Morgan, and south of 35th. no meters. Okay, so you have to walk two or three blocks, are you telling me that when you go to your Lincoln Park or Gold Coast salon you don't have to walk? If so you're living life right and have some good Karma going on.Area - Someone said \"dicey or sketch\" you're kidding right? You know you're in Chicago? Maybe you don't. \u00a0If you're worried about it CC is for you.Price/products- I didn't think the prices were out of line for the expertise. I'm a firm believer of you usually get what you pay for. I didn't feel pressured to buy anything, Liz showed me a couple of products at the end, and I explained that I have plenty now at home and I've been using Aveda products which she agreed that Aveda makes good stuff, there was no pressure.I'm very happy I gave them a try, and I'll be returning. Next time I'll walk or just bike down, today I needed my car for other errands after.

Thirty3 Bar and Grill is located at 3304 S. Halsted St. in the heart of Bridgeport.Our group of 9 came in hot this past Sunday afternoon to checkout the joint. Many of us have passed by but never stopped in to check it out. As we tried to walk in, the door was locked and the place was empty. They seemed shocked to have guests on a Sunday late afternoon.This place gives off an intimidating look because it doesn't fit the culture and decor of the neighborhood Bridgeport bars. It definitely is a step up from the old school flare of typical Bridgeport bars, which we all crave at times.Now, on to the liquor. They offer $3 draft and bottle beers! The owner greeted us with buying our group a round of Irish Car Bombs, which we quickly accepted the kind gesture. Noteworthy, they are only $5 on Sundays. The liquor was very reasonably priced and even at a lower price than other neighborhood bars.The restaurant largely serves bar fare like burgers and fried appetizers. In our opinion, pizza must be done well if its on the menu or there is no reason to have it on there. In an attempt to soak up the alcohol from day drinking, we ordered a party size cheese pizza as several people in our party are vegetarians. After waiting, they delivered a steaming hot sausage pizza. They quickly realized the mistake and instead of tossing the pizza out, they were nice enough to leave it at the bar for our meat-eating guests to enjoy while we waited for the cheese pizza. Shockingly, we all thought the pizza was above average bar pizza. Based on the pizza, we will be returning to check out some additional menu options.Karaoke starts at 9pm every Sunday. I'm not sure if this happens every Sunday but two of the staff members gave us a Coyote Ugly inspired performance on top of the bar, which was a nice touch to end of our Sunday FUNday.Bottom line, it was a great time at Thirty3 Bar & Grill. Its a nice atmosphere bar that is clean and friendly and will not cost you an arm and a leg to eat and drink there. We still have Bohemian Rhapsody and Pour Some Sugar On Me stuck in our heads.

There were several things promised to us and replaced with something sub-optimum or not delivered at all. In summary, the dealings with the venue was fine up until 5 weeks before the wedding. Out of the 8 vendors I worked with for our wedding I unfortunately have to say that this vendor caused the most stress and was the most difficult to work with 5 weeks leading up to the wedding including the day of the wedding. Pro's-Some guests accidently came through the cafe instead of the side entrance. The doors were locked, so they unlocked the doors and let guests enter through the cafe even though we did not rent the space. -There was not a convenient place for the bridal party to reside before making the grand entrance to the reception, so they opened the Spirit Space for us to use temporarily even though we did not rent the space. -One of the maintenance men (don't remember his name) and the day of event liason, Kenny, was very nice to work with.Issues1) We were told just 5 weeks before the wedding that the Venue was going to charging us $400 to use the ceremony site for the wedding rehearsal. 2 hour minimum was required. At contract signing, Donna (event director), did not indicate there was any charge and indicated that all we had to do was give them a week's notice. When mentioning what I recalled to her, she indicated she was talking about letting us use the reception site. I may be totally off, but I would think that a wedding rehearsal would be done at the ceremony site. Her reasoning for needing to charge us was that she would have to pay someone to open the gates for us because the venue was not open to the public. When prompting her further her reason was...\"She is running a business!\". \u00a0The delivery of the $400 charge was via email. I was very upset to say the least. We were stuck and had no choice. I had to entertain ideas of having the rehearsal done at a baseball field or someone's backyard, but luckily ended up doing it at the reception space. This experience with the Director, who was also our main contact at the venue, made all interactions leading up to the wedding more difficult. 2) A private room was not available for the bridal party to touch up prior to the ceremony When signing this venue, the event director told us that the Bridal party could use a room in the building next to the life garden (the old space of Cataleya) to get ready and touch up before the ceremony. Upon the wedding we asked how we can access this room, and the event director indicated that the only room available is the Foundation room which is the gallery attached to the garden. This building is the only air conditioned space at the site, has the only on-site bathroom, and is also open for guests to enter. Traditionally, guests are not supposed to see the bride before the ceremony. The was impossible given the option the venue suggested. Guests come in and out of the building to use the bathroom and shelter from the heat. The \"powder room\" they suggested is actually the bathroom in the Foundation gallery which is the size of a closet and as mentioned, is also a public bathroom.What made it worse, it my opinion, was the director's attitude. She made it seem like this has always been the case and that what they offered was more than sufficient. I mentioned that I remember the building next door would be available which then prompted her to say \"well, Cataleya used to be there but has moved out since...\" 3) The event director refused to give a day of contact to myself or my wedding coordinator. As you know, it is common practice to contact all vendors before a wedding and also to have a day of contact in case of any issues, and especially access to the venue etc. \u00a0At this point, I had almost given up getting support/information from the venue. Luckily a friend of ours stepped in to be the day of coordinator and after multiple emails and calls, we obtained a contact number the night before the wedding. \u00a04) Guest Bathroom at the Life Garden: The bathroom was out of soap and didn't have a waste basket. My MOH luckily noticed this before most of the guests came and asked the event liaison to remedy the issue. They did promptly, however, these are bare essentials you would expect properly prepared for you. 5) We were also promised 2 security guards as part of the $350 rental fee of the parking lot next door which typically went for $500. My guests said they never saw security guards at the parking lot.To be fair, my rating is an average between 2 criteria.

We were looking for a unique and fun space for our wedding - something that was both affordable and classy and that's exactly what we got with Zhou B. The space is fantastic and can really be transformed with different kinds of art and how you dress up the space for your event. When you walk inside the space with no installation on the walls it can feel a bit cold and dark but that's mainly because of the old industrial feel of the warehouse building. However, this is exactly what gives the space character and allows you to change the mood and feeling when you put up an installation or house your event there.Just on its own, Zhou B is a great gallery to see art from local artists that have studios in the building, to the Zhou brother's great works to other famous artists. I believe the Zhou brothers own 9 buildings in the area and have a hidden gem on S. Morgan and 35th: a smaller gallery with more of their own work with a beautiful and serene attached garden space that you can also use for your even.Back to the main building on 35th. This is where my wife and I held our reception and it was really great. The main floor has two great spaces (Moongate and Spirit) that you can rent and also a huge second floor that can house around 300 people. Since we had about 130 guests we only needed to use the Spirit room which is what you see when you walk in the front door. Also, be aware that's there a nice little cafe in side the building that you can visit while you are viewing the current installation. \u00a0Anyway, the Spirit space was fantastic for our reception and worked perfectly with our floor plan and the ambience we went for. Our lighting team really did wonders in the room and our planners helped make the space beautiful. The art installation that was on the walls was perfect for our event and every one of our guests raved about the space and the art. \u00a0They all thought Zhou B was so unique.As previously mentioned, the garden/gallery space on S. Morgan is awesome. We decided to rent two spaces for our wedding so we could have our reception outside in the garden. The space was perfect for our guests and for our ceremony. Everything was set up perfect and our DJ was able to hook up sound so our music for the procession and recession and then for the short cocktail reception afterward was on point. \u00a0The garden space really is something you can't miss.If you decide you are interested in hosting an event at one of the Zhou B spaces (weddings, fashion shows, party, charity event, etc) you will most likely work with Donna Bliss. She really is a fantastic person to work with - really organized and on top of things. She truly cares about your event and what you are looking to do and will always help you along the way. \u00a0Donna really helped us feel comfortable and come to the conclusion that this was the right place for our wedding. \u00a0In addition, her staff are also great and were responsive and helpful in our planning and on the wedding day.I also need to touch on one other thing. The pricing for renting one or two spaces is very reasonable. \u00a0As with a lot of unique spaces in Chicago, just be aware that you will have to rent all of your equipment (tables, chairs, silverware, plates, etc). Zhou B does not own any of this stuff. They do have tables and chairs for the main space that they keep on site but you have to rent them from Tablescapes for about $4 a guest (another company we worked with that is pretty good).Having this experience at Zhou B allows us to have lasting memories and know that we have a place in the city to come back to for a variety of reasons.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 2, 13]}, "2": {"description": "Another gallery/event space in Bridgeport.

They were pretty dense, each the size of a mini burrito maybe.The al pastor tasted fine, nothing special. I couldn't finish it after encountering some weird crunching, which I suspected was cartilage or tendon. Not my favorite. The carne asada was slightly better, though pretty bland as well. At least it was just meat with no surprises. I had to douse both tacos with hot sauce, which was surprisingly good, since I hate tabasco.

Or deliver your food while you're throwing 'em back next door. If you prefer eating there but are hankering for a brew, good news ~ they are BYOB! It's a really chill & laid back environment so I can see the appeal of dining in.On my latest visit, I had their Mushroom & Kale royal pie for $7.95. The crust was flaky yet smooth, I'm sure slathered in butter to give it the delectable taste in every bite. My pie was filled with mushrooms, kale, scallions, herbs, parmesan and white wine. These aren't the huge full size dessert pies you are familiar with but rather are more like personal sized pies - perfect for a meal for one. It was just the right size for my dinner and I gobbled up every bit I could because it was so darn heavenly.My only regret - not trying their scotch egg. I didn't think it would travel well home with me...but I'm really wishing I just gave it a go anyways.

Anytime chorizo is involved, I expect a lot of flavor, and I thought the pupusa would only add to the flavor aspect and give the dish a different texture component as well. To my dismay, the chorizo was actually kind of bland! And the pupusa was WAAAAY too dense for me. It was hard to cut, hard to eat, and filled me up way too quickly. Side note, I've never had pupusa before so maybe it's supposed to be served that way..?

We tried to make a reservation for an hour later (12 PM), but according to the online reservation system, they were booked until 3 PM. Because Nana is in Bridgeport, we figured there was no way it could be totally booked, so we chanced it and decided to show up and see what we could find. Parking was free on Sunday, which was a major plus. Upon walking in, we noted that it was both charming and a bit cramped. The hostess was really busy talking on the phone, walking to and from the hostess desk, all while sipping Starbucks coffee. Even though there were people waiting in front of us and people who arrived after us, we were all able to be seated immediately. This surprised me because of the lack of online reservations. I guess they count on plenty of people showing up without a reservation. We were brought water right away, but it wasn't for several minutes until our waitress appeared. She was very friendly, and explained the restaurant's philosophy to us because this was our first visit. We were going to order empanadas, but she informed us they were sold out. So we started right with entrees. I got the coconut cheese french toast with mango syrup. It was good, but not as sweet as I imagined it would be. It was supposed to have coconut cheesecake filling, but none was visible when I opened up the two pieces of bread, which were put together like a sandwich. What I had was tasty (I LOVED the toasted coconut), but it didn't live up to what it sounded like it should have been. My boyfriend was still hungry after finishing his huevos rancheros. The portion was similar to tapas, not to a fullblown $13 entree. A complaint I have is how small and cramped everything is. At the hostess stand, there's no space whatsoever to wait before being seated. It ended up being fine because we didn't have to wait. But I could see this place getting backed up with people with nowhere to stand. Also, the bathroom is very, very small. I had to time myself perfectly getting up from the table to walk over because there were so many people (mostly staff, but also some other customers) walking around. Even though I did have some complaints, there's no denying the food is very good. Despite my three star rating, I do still recommend it, and we may still return.

Since I'm a little bit of an ass, we'll start with the negative.The sushi is not very good. It's what I consider sushi buffet quality. There is nothing inherently wrong with that; there are days when I want to just pig out and have some all-you-can-eat sushi, but when you're ordering rolls by the roll (and paying for them by the roll), it really does not make a satisfied customer of me. If you'd like me to nitpick further, well here goes: the fish didn't seem all that fresh, the rice was cooked all that well, and the rolls themselves were quite small. I ordered a staple of any sushi place: the salmon skin roll, and I was very disappointed. Usually, the fried salmon skin provides a nice crunchy contrast to the bed of fluffy rice around it; here, the salmon meat was not filleted off of the skin enough and so you ended up with a somewhat awkward bite. Crunchy, yes, but also quite tough to chew through. Color me disappointed. Another negative was the special dessert offered on Valentine's Day. Though given to us for free, it really wasn't very good. Matcha frosting and filling on a yellow-cake cupcake? No, that's okay, but thank you anyway.And now on to the good news:Tonkotsu Ramen. 'Nuff said. Delectable pieces of marinated pork belly swimming in a pork broth with handmade ramen. Fantastic! Truly the star of yesterday's meal. Friends and all raved on and on about that fantastic bowl of noodles. If I were running Kawa, I'd make the ramen the star of the show; hey! it's popular now, anyway. But that's just me, and my four friends, and an acquaintance who recommended your restaurant to us. Also, Olivia. Great job, lady. You're a great server, and truly a valuable asset to the Kawa team.

Since I'm a little bit of an ass, we'll start with the negative.The sushi is not very good. It's what I consider sushi buffet quality. There is nothing inherently wrong with that; there are days when I want to just pig out and have some all-you-can-eat sushi, but when you're ordering rolls by the roll (and paying for them by the roll), it really does not make a satisfied customer of me. If you'd like me to nitpick further, well here goes: the fish didn't seem all that fresh, the rice was cooked all that well, and the rolls themselves were quite small. I ordered a staple of any sushi place: the salmon skin roll, and I was very disappointed. Usually, the fried salmon skin provides a nice crunchy contrast to the bed of fluffy rice around it; here, the salmon meat was not filleted off of the skin enough and so you ended up with a somewhat awkward bite. Crunchy, yes, but also quite tough to chew through. Color me disappointed. Another negative was the special dessert offered on Valentine's Day. Though given to us for free, it really wasn't very good. Matcha frosting and filling on a yellow-cake cupcake? No, that's okay, but thank you anyway.And now on to the good news:Tonkotsu Ramen. 'Nuff said. Delectable pieces of marinated pork belly swimming in a pork broth with handmade ramen. Fantastic! Truly the star of yesterday's meal. Friends and all raved on and on about that fantastic bowl of noodles. If I were running Kawa, I'd make the ramen the star of the show; hey! it's popular now, anyway. But that's just me, and my four friends, and an acquaintance who recommended your restaurant to us. Also, Olivia. Great job, lady. You're a great server, and truly a valuable asset to the Kawa team.

I was a bit surprised but then he broke down why which gave me confidence in his suggestion. My previous bike had modern handle bars and I ride a lot. I would get tension headaches a lot too. With the bike Jerry sold me, they stopped. I've gone back several times for repairs, upgrades and such and he's really about customer service. He remembers everybody but has no clue what your name is. One big thing to remember is time is relative to Jerry. He opens when he feels like it, closes when he feels like it, and finishes when he feels like it. So just like with my uncles, I've learned to call him when he says he'll call, budget in extra time that he'll have my bike and call before I go to make sure he's there.

I wanted a women's road bike and a U-lock. Jerry (one of the owners) told me that he had the perfect bike in mind. It was a 1960's Schwinn road bike that used to belong to his wife. He and his wife took it out and showed me. Jerry noticed that it only had one brake and said he would put one on if I decided to purchase it. I was sold.Initially, they said that they could give me the bike alone for $175 instead of $190. Then they decided $200 for the bike and lock. It was a bit high so I asked for $185, we met at $190. I was able to get the bike and U-lock for $190 (a bit over my budget, but I still think it was a deal). After, they asked me how my bike was stolen and we had a conversation.

By classic, for me personally (a 39 year record collector who's been buying music since I was 11), I mean here places like Hegewish, Record Swap, Threshold, Rose Records, or the Crow's Nest. Other collectors who are bit older than me I know will use that classification for other places--Beverly Records back in the day, Val's Halla also back in the day, Rolling Stones back in the day, etc, etc. There just aren't many places left that have the \"presence and feel\" of those \"classics.\" This is not to say there aren't still great record stores left in Chicagoland--Reckless, Dusty Groove, Dave's, Jazz Record Mart, and Oak Park Records are all fantastic shops, in my opinion, and do a wonderful job serving the record buyer community. But although that's the case, the \"presence and feel\" of those places is not like the others I mentioned above--each has it's own quirks and differences that make them unique, but not in that \"special way\" the older places I've mentioned were like.Let's Boogie, a small but great shop in the Bridgeport area, is one shop left in Chicagoland that DOES take you back to the times of those classic record shops, and does so with style. Unlike Val Halla's and Beverly Records, two of the stores I mentioned above which are still open, Let's Boogie maintains that classic \"presence and feel\" while also NOT being a vinyl graveyard. They have also weathered changing markets better than say, Rolling Stones out in the suburbs, which has now become a bloated dinosaur with far too many CDs racks.Because of this fact, they have maintained the \"presence and feel\" of the old shops, and they continue to offer selections on vinyl (as well as other formats) that aren't just the picked over, fair or good records sold as being better quality than that, selections you find at places like Val's or Beverly these days. Meanwhile, they offer the better quality LPs they do have at great prices. You will find deals here that match, or are better than, what you will find at the current crop of \"great places\" like Reckless and Dusty Groove, as well. Finally, the store's owner also makes the place worth shopping at--a huge music fan who is very knowledgeable and who seems to be generally more personable than clerks at places like Jazz Record Mart or Dave's tend to be.One downside is that the place only takes cash. So, as other reviewers have said, come prepared. Another downside is that although the prices are comparable with places like Reckless and Dave's, the overall selection of LPs here is more limited. They do a great job stocking classic rock, pop more generally, and stuff like soul, funk, r and b, and new wave, but are less strong in areas outside these.

So I figured I was only 0.2 miles away and would do a price drive by. I was excited to see the low price and not the annoying sign that says price with car wash. Those should be illegal like false advertising. I pulled in and filled up. It was worth it to drive in when you are saving that much on a tank fill up.The location seems a little hidden.
