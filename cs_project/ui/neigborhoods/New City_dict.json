Pizza night. We have had pizza from Phil's a few times but each time had been delivery. It was a cool summer night out so we decided we would pick it up this time instead.I called in my order and spoke to a man on the phone. The time was 7:20 pm. A large special was ordered after a brief discussion. 30 minutes, he said. No, wait. He changed his mind. Better make it 40 minutes. I said, no problem.I showed up at 8:10ish pm and made my way to the counter. There was one family of 4 having their dinner at a table and 3 other customers waiting for their take-out/pick-up order. The family of 4 will come into play later.Behind the counter was a young Hispanic with her hair tied back in a pony tail. She looked busy as she called out an order for someone to come pick up. She asked me my name and I responded. \"Its not ready.\" she said and she turned away before I could even ask her how much longer it would take. She retreated into the kitchen where it looked like there was about 4 or 5 people making pizzas frantically. I decided not to wait for her to return and grabbed a seat in the diner. Customer after customer walked in and asked about their take-out and every response from the woman was \"It's not ready\". And each time, she would turn away as quickly as she could to retreat to the kitchen.Now, I've worked in a restaurant before. I understand that a kitchen can get backed up and things can fall apart pretty quickly. The woman didn't handle the customers very well but at this point, I just thought she was ill-trained and maybe a little rude. This would change later.After waiting for about 15 minutes, I decided to face the rude woman behind the counter. I walked up and waited for her to come back and asked her how long it would take. She asked for my name again and before my lips could even finish forming the last syllable, she responded.\"It's not ready.\"Here's where the family of 4 comes in. The father behind me must have raised his hand to signal for her because at this point she leaned around me and asked him what he needed. Apparently, he wanted another 2 liter of Pepsi because she went to go get it for him. I waited.\"I understand its not ready, but how much longer will it be?\"With an irritated huff, she went into the kitchen and looked on their table of order slips. Without even turning to face me, she shouted \"5 minutes\". Rude? What's worst than rude? Whatever it is, she's riding that border like a pro at this point. At this point, the dining room has 8 other customers waiting. I went back to my game of 2048 on my phone and just waited. At 8:40 pm, I finally heard my name called. Here's where the story actually gets uglier.There was an elderly woman there who had been waiting before I even arrived. She got up and very irately began to complain how people who arrived after her were getting their food before her. Rightly so. The young woman with the pony tail responded by saying her food wasn't ready and that phone orders were at 40 minutes. Remember, I got there at 8:10 pm and it was now 8:40 pm. This poor woman had to have been waiting for more than 40 minutes in that waiting room now. At this point, the elderly woman was visibly angry because she thinks she's being mistreated. In response, the woman with the pony tail laughs. Yah. She laughs. I was stunned. I look into the kitchen to see if anybody there was \"Phil\" or a manager or something had seen this. The closest man to the front was at the pizza oven. He had heard. And he was also laughing.Phil's Pizza is good. It is. But the employees/managers/owner there aren't rude. No, this isn't rudeness. It's contempt. They believe that they can laugh in an elderly woman's face because they're Phil's Pizza. They are hurtful and they are dishonorable. At some point, you have to decide whether good pizza is worth supporting a business that would hurt another person just because they can.We have leftovers. I think I'm just going to throw it away.

It's tiny inside, there was only one man manning the grill. \u00a0No AC either, which meant our stay was uncomfortably warm. It was also kinda busy, but we still didn't have to wait long, the grill man was very quite good at being a grill man. He was also pretty friendly, saying to us right after we walked in and handing us paper menus. They also don't bring your food to you, so just be advised that if you are not sitting at the counter you'll have to get up and get your meal. The place really has no ambiance or anything. Its in a simple room with simple signs on the wall and simple booths that are the kind that sit on the wall. Just a dive. The food is also served on plastic plates. The food was decent though. I very much enjoyed my gyro. It wasn't overly greasy, and the grill man actually put the meat on the grill for a few minutes which made some of the meat kinda crispy, which was a nice touch. The fries were also very good. Shoestring style. Aaron S. got the double cheese burger. Prices are quite cheap. Lunch only was eleven bucks for the two of us.

\u00a0Because there were DEAD flies. \u00a0During my walk-around, I considered moving us to a table by the window with chairs instead of the benches, and that's when I saw the fly graveyard. \u00a0Just tens of large dead flies, belly-up and sitting on the ledge by the window right by the table where people eat their food.And yes, I SAW this and still ATE my food a few minutes later. \u00a0And I waited until AFTER she ate and we left the restaurant to take her back to the outside of the window so she could look in and see what I saw.And again, I'm torn. \u00a0The service was friendly (that we saw). \u00a0The food was tasty (worth coming back for). \u00a0But the cleanliness and atmosphere? \u00a0Atrocious. \u00a0As I told her as we were walking away - maybe I'd consider coming back in the winter. \u00a0I doubt he'd have much heat control, so a seat on the stools by the grill would be warm, and the door would be closed so there'd be no flies.(Oh, and I should mention they're cash only and there's no ATM inside.)So I enjoyed the food and there's a chance we'll be back someday when the conditions are better. \u00a0And frankly, our stomachs are only stronger for what we've been through. \u00a0After all, the only way our bodies can become strong enough to fight off bacteria and infections is to give it lots of practice. \u00a0And that's why I'm still alive.(And if I die soon, someone can please posthumously update my review.)", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 8, 16]}}, "neighborhoods": ["New City", "Canaryville"], "latitude": 41.8091174215078, "longitude": -87.6454858481884, "rating": "3.0", "times": {"Mon": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Thu": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sat": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Wed": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Tue": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"], "Sun": ["9:00 am", "3:00 pm"], "Fri": ["7:00 am", "7:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Burgers", "burgers"]], "address": ["4653 S Halsted St"], "attributes": {"Take-out": "Yes", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "No", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "No", "Delivery": "No", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Attire": "Casual", "Waiter Service": "No", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Drive-Thru": "No", "Good for Kids": "Yes"}, "category": "Restaurants", "number_of_reviews": "3"}, "value-city-department-store-chicago": {"comments": {"1": {"description": "I do not recommend this service an products not even if they give them free!

At first glance, it looks nice and clean with has a lot of room for potential but once you get down to it, you leave disappointed with the whole experience. Day before leaving on a trip, I had to cheat on my reg nail place and get my nails done during lunchtime. I checked yelp and Celine's had the highest ratings. I called about an hour before and they said I *must* have an appt. I scheduled one for that upcoming hour, even though it felt pointless. I arrive and the space is huge. There's rooms going into another room that has another room. A lot of pink walls and really intricate ceiling decor. The room I was taken to had a scaffold that I prayed didn't fall on me and looked like it was still undergoing construction. The girl that helped me was nice and not chatty which is perfect when I'm feeling antisocial. Lighting was pretty horrible in this room. I understand wanting to keep the electric bill down, but these girls rely mostly on the natural light which isn't smart when chicago gets bipolar and cloudy. They have tiny lamps for them to work with but when I picked my nail color, it was dim and I picked what looked like a light red. She began removing the current no-chip and placed my hands in weird warm gloves. She said it was to speed up the removal but it didn't do jack. The girl had to scrape my nails like you scrape baked grease off a pan. She began the routine mani steps and I noticed there was 0 water for my hands to be placed in. I hate hate hate these \"dry\" manis. She ends up yanking and cutting hard skin and the results are kinda ugly. Once she painted the nails and asked to put my hands in the UV thingy, the UV apparatus was crusty with previous dried up polish or god knows what. The whole time I prayed I wasn't catching an illness and washed my hands asap. I later walked into my office (with bright lights) and realized I had a freakin' peach colored mani. Peach! I was short on time and couldn't go back to correct it but I looked pretty odd for a couple weeks with peach nails against my crazy pale hands. The price was cheap but you get what you pay for.

The only thing I didn't enjoy about the pedicure was that the technician's hands were very cold. Also the lotion she put on my feet was freezing! Not very comforting. I guess this was because the salon was cold to begin with..... During my pedicure another technician started cleaning the station next to me. I noticed she sprayed Scrubbing Bubbles on the bowl and then she sprayed it on the pumice and the other utensil she used to smooth my feet!! She then scrubbed them both with a nail brush. I don't think this is the proper way to clean utensils at all! This lead me to believe that the white water was left over Scrubbing Bubbles.  Then I was moved to the other side of the salon for my manicure, which was even colder!!! The manicure was great but I couldn't enjoy it since it was so cold. And then add on the technicians cold hands and cold lotion. I actually had to ask the technician to stop for a minute while I put my jacket back on.

Granted they did state on their website that they support local \"vendors\" AND local farmers so it's a blend. I suppose I should have thought it out more when I saw I was getting avacado's and such. It's not like we have a ton of options when it comes to US grown produce during the winter. But Mexican-stamped \"organic\" is not exactly reliable in my book. I lived in Latin America and I know how ethics will be compromised in the name of earning a dime. (sorry, Latin America! love you! besos...)The cost for the Door to Door service is pretty high, too. I think you're primarily paying for the delivery service. I had a total of 18 veggie/fruit mix (\"bitty mixed\" box size) and the original price was $26.99 with delivery. That's about $1.50 per veggie/fruit. I can get organic from Stanley's for a fraction of the price (granted, Stanley's shelf-life isn't as long but it's still a good deal for me). Fortunately I had a Groupon for $14 that I used towards that purchase, so it was a better deal for me. Still, for $14 I could have gotten much more produce at Stanley's so maybe I'm spoiled to have such a fantastic produce store right behind me. So is door to door friendly, reliable and convenient? Yes. But due to the reasons I stated above, it's just not a good fit for me. A little too out of my budget.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 1, 21]}, "24": {"description": "I love D2D Organics - so convenient, and saves me time and money.

I mean, there aren't many bakeries around me if I'm not in the mood for packzis. I was so excited to try this place out. I woke up early on a midweek day off, started a pot of coffee, and headed over in my pj's to get some sweets for my morning. The place was busy. A good sign right? The lines were moving quickly and the staff was super nice. I stood perusing the pastry case and finally settled on an almond croissant and a cheese slice. As I gave the gal my order, she told me it was buy one get one for the croissants. Sweet! I'll take the chocolate croissant as well. She bagged up my goodies and forked over $2.73. Man, this place just kept getting better and better. Free sweets and cheap?!? I'm in. I got home, poured a cup of coffee, and sat down to watch \"Now, Voyager \"(for the millionth time). Sat down with my cheese slice that looked so pretty, and dug in. bleh! The crust was rubbery. RUBBERY! How the hell does that happen in a bakery? In my kitchen, yes. In a bakery, hellz to the naw! The cream cheese filling was alright but the top layer was some weird, gelatinous, lemony stuff. Just ick! Strike one. On the the chocolate croissant. The pastry wasn't as light and buttery as I expect croissants to be and the chocolate wasn't very, well, indulgent. Kind of tasted like a melted Hersey bar. It wasn't bad - but wasn't as good as I had hoped. I ate it though, but that's because there's a fat girl trapped inside of me that's dying to get out. Strike two. Lastly, the almond croissant. By this time, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. The pastry was flaky and buttery. The almond filling was rich and tasty, and the sliced almonds on top gave it a nice crunch. I will give this joint another try. I mean, they only got two strikes, so they're still in the game. This time I'll try lunch.

The free service of reducing the bigger pieces to smaller bits was swift and available in a brief wait time.

I finally had the time today so I pulled into the rutted parking lot and walked toward the building. As I got closer i saw a guy who looked like me - a little thick - dark hair. He was a bit younger - \u00a0he could have been my kid brother. He was wearing a white lab coat and a white helmet. The green patch n his jacket read \"Park Packing.\"I asked if there was an actual butcher on the premises - what the deal was - etc. He smiled as if he was inviting me into his own backyard to grill up some steaks and talk football.This guy seriously loves the place he works. He walked me into the large cooler/retail space. There before my eyes where tables and bins and buckets full of butchered animals - mostly pig from what I could see. \u00a0\"We have whole pigs - sucklings - whatever you need. This is Disneyland for meat lovers,\" he said to me. \"If you need anything else - you can ask. I'm always around.\" Then my pithy meat merchant was gone.There were all variety of ribs. There were pigs' heads and cow's tongues. There were whole catfish and other types of scaly delights. There were buckets with hearts and stomachs and other vital organs from pigs and cows. There was a great bucket of ham bones (ten cents a pound.)I set about getting my plastic gloves on and began with four beautiful pork necks which I will use to make a nice pasta sauce next week. Then it was the saw back ribs - two large slabs - by large I mean I would have trouble eating just one of these slabs. (Side note: I am the guy the \"all-you-can-eat\" rib joints are afraid of. Oh the humanity!)Then two packages of pork chops and four packages of rib tips. They had beef and fish and all variety of fresh butchered offerings but I was set (for now) with my pork selections. I walked through the wrong door - and then back through the right door to the cashier. Apparently this happens on a regular basis. I set my food on the belt for the woman to ring it up. The entire order came to less than $20.00. (Another guy boxed up my order really nice in a solid box and sealed the box shut.)To be clear this was enough pork products to feed four normal people three normal meals. \u00a0(For me this is about - ah don't ask.

I ordered them with avocado and extra rice. When the food came, they sent along 3 medium sized containers of salsa. The salsa doesn't have much flavor aside from tomato. It would be much better if they spiced it up, and offered both red and green salsa. They also included a small bag of chips. The chips were a little stale, but I can't really complain about something I didn't ask for. The burritos were so-so, and would have been improved by some more flavorful salsa. They could have also improve the burritos by adding a some more re-fried beans, pickled carrots, pickled onions, hot peppers, and that sort of thing. I also couldn't help but to be a little bothered by how much tortilla was left over, though the burrito is pretty filling.Vista, do the following and you have a fan:1) Don't worry about the chips and salsa, people don't usually expect those to come with delivery2) Pack a little bag of spicy carrots, onions, and peppers with tacos and burritos3) Start making spicier salsa - red and green - feel free to make the containers smaller if it cuts into your profit margins.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 10, 2]}, "12": {"description": "My husband ususally orders parrilada's to go.

I also usually don't eat around the Back of the Yards area. I was a little nervous if I would be able to find this place. It's next to the tire shop, on of the few buildings on the 4200 Ashland block. The inside decor is a mix of simple and quaint. I sat in the middle facing the front door. The view of the walls and door from the inside was cute! Blue with white trim. One wall was blank, and the painted other wall was covered with curtains. Not sure why. Servers are quite attentive. Our main server was being trained so another server watched her as she took our orders. I ordered the Combinacion Vistas Hermosas for our appetizer. The Piquaditas were delicious! The queso Fresca was absolute delicious and fresh. I originally came because I was craving chorizo, and therefore had the Huevos Cochina (spicy cactus sauce, chorizo, pinto beans, rice, and eggs). The other order was grilled shrimp with salad, rice, and fries. I didn't see this on the menu on Yelp. The shrimp was crispy and flavorful. The rice was yellow rice with bits of potatoes and onion. The salad had a slice of avocado, but did not come with a dressing. We also received a basket of corn tortilla.On the menu there is a line that says something along the lines of, \"Our service may be slow, but it's not because our servers are slow, everything is made to order.\"It's a great place to slowly enjoy your food and chat. The salsa that came with the perfect amount of chips was more watery than I had expected, but had the right amount of spicy flavor (it was orange). \u00a0I enjoyed the music. The TV screen, however, is like a Spanish version of MTV, but the music on the screen didn't match what was playing on the stereo speakers. I would definitely come back for the Piquaditas.

While I really longed for the tactile response of an acoustic piano, city/apartment life isn't particularly conducive to owning a grand piano. I walked in the store with my heart set on the Yamaha Clavinova series of digital pianos, but Steve demonstrated several hybrid pianos, which combine the versatility of digital sound with the touch of an acoustic piano.

No matter what time of day or night you pass this place there will always be tons of kids with less than a promising future hanging out, people with a very limited budget, as well as police having dinner.The menu is limited, greasy, unhealthy, and not very good. You can get 2 hot dogs, fries, and a Pepsi for under $2.00. The pizza by the slice is available at $1.00 so they actually limit how many slices you can buy. I guess they are worried about a family of 10 coming in and feeding their whole family on slices. The service is ok, no wait staff just a counter where you can place your order. Nothing notable or difficult about ordering slices and dogs. The staff is mostly comprised of Hispanic people in red shirts. Washing your hands before you eat is not necessary as this place lacks the level of cleanliness you would expect from a food service establishment. Forget about using the bathroom unless you want to boot up, snort something, do a drug deal, hide a dead body, or roll a blunt. They do deliver until about 3:00am. If you are hanging out in Canaryville for the night you will notice the delivery cars racing around the streets as this place is actually very popular.

Every time I visit for either business or pleasure I am completely intrigued. One thing to comment on is that this part of the world is comprised of mostly white, Irish, White Sox loving born and bred Chicagoans. This is where real \"salt of the earth\" people live. You can actually see hard life on the faces of the people, even children and read them like a book. What is strange is that people that grow up in Canaryville seldom ever leave or move away. When you speak to a resident more times than not they will put down or degrade their own neighborhood, but on the other hand will fist fight or do murder to protect a strange feeling of pride they have. There are gangs here and although they remain in the shadows you may from time to time encounter tactical police officers performing a shakedown on a group of men all around a beat up car. Police scanners are very common place in homes and everyone knows everything about everybody. They do not like outsiders but will tolerate them. This includes black, Hispanic, even me as I am an Italian/English, east coast talking stranger. Driving around this part of the city you will certainly be noticed and accounted for.

It had a nice smoky tabasco scent to it. The chicken was juicy, the sauce was slightly sweet and slightly had a kick to it. It was addicting.

So, great reviews are totally fitting for this place where lunch can run you 12 m'f'n bucks. Where the hell can you get non highly processed home made coffee, sandwiches, and desserts that don't cost your left gonad? And on the South Side? Hmmm.... no brainer: this place.Being a native of the South Side I have resented the Yelp-er and usual transplant belief that anything of cultural value and good taste resides on the North Side. This place is an oasis amongst fast food joints (i.e. DD and MCD's are a block away) on the fringe of the old stockyard industrial sector where the local lardery emits some quite nasty fumes on hot summer days (yeah, that sucks, Back of the Yards). Parking is available on the side of the building on a gravel lot -- probably waiting for some other development to swipe it. There's also Ashland, but that is limited.Place is family run. The service is quite friendly and helpful. The coffee is great. Espresso and cafe con leche for under $2? Hook me up please. I got wired and jittery on just little cup of the former. Great taste, bitter and strong. The only thing is that speed is an issue. If you're in an absolute rush it might help to call in a larger order. Drinks come fast, but the sandwiches take a few minutes. So, is that really a deal breaker? Hardly. The sandwiches are quite well seasoned and fresh. The steak is marinated and well cooked. It could be trimmed of the little globules of fat for those who have a hard time dealing with that kind of thing, but frankly if you're expecting health food you can order the veggie empanada which is pretty damn good. If you feel like you need to sneak in some Irish Creme, don't you can just bring your own bottle of anything -- It's BYOB.Enjoyed studying (they have WIFI) and sitting around this place with its great seating, not the biggest place, but it definitely deserves a shot if you're in the area and want to avoid fried crap and the high fructose corn syrup diet that is the bane of much of the South Side.Come here and give it your business so I have a good place to study and munch of goodies, dammit!", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 6, 23]}, "12": {"description": "Discovered this place through Yelp and its definitly a hidden gem in New City.

I knew from the minute I walked into this place my search would continue. The owner (Mai) isn't warm at all. She's cold with cut n dry comments. On my first visit it was 3 of us and we were told it would be 30 minutes. We decided to wait, as I looked around I noticed Mai is the ONLY nail tech. And there's 2 techs that does the pedicures. There's 4 nail stations and 3 pedicure stations. 3 hours later I was satisfied with my service. Not impressed but satisfied. They do have OPI and Essie but the colors are VERY limited. They have a verity of colors for the NO CHIP manicures (which is the in thing) tho. But that was ok by me because I've learned to bring my own polish. I decided to go back for my 2 week maintenance and figured out how Mai operates. Because the place is so small and tucked away she doesn't get a lot of business and she remembers her clients. Because on my first time we were new she didn't turn us away but as I sat there and observed her I noticed that if 2 or more ppl came in together she would tell them they're busy and they would need to make an appointment. But if you come in alone she would take you and give you a 20-30 minute wait time. On my second time again, I was satisfied but not impressed so I came back for a third time BAD MISTAKE. Because I've decided to go stiletto after 15 years of wearing natural nails and she's the ONLY nail tech she does my nails while another worker does my pedi. I like one person working on me per visit. Mai doesn't buff the nails enough so no matter what I have dull spots on them. And the pedicure ladies (yep I've had both of them service me) give rush jobs. The polish is sloppy (all over my skin). I had to ask them (all 3 times) to wash the pedi tub. They reuse the toe separators and the pedi shoes (I spoke up and made them open new materials for me). But you BETTER know as soon as you speak up for yourself they speak in their native tongue and all 3 look right in your direction. No shame or discretion at all. Because she turns people away and it's so small that it's quiet and if you like Metv (all throwback shows) then this can be a place for you but if you're a stickler for perfect service DON'T waste your time. And please believe the people raving about this place is more concerned about the $30 Mon-Thurs mani/pedi special.

Awesome deal. Now the vendor who had been selling this item had a store going out of business in the city. He wasnt able to sell all of his inventory at his location but he had to quickly pay the rent of his store. So he came to the flea market, the vendor sold all of his items. In spite of the fact, people dont carry huge sums of money with them at a flea market due to possible theft. Buyers would get contact information from the vendor and make a time frame for a future transaction. This RC Helicoptor has an easy value of $400 to $500. I saved $300 to $400. Today, I had ventured to swapa-rama on a mission to find effective bug spray, paint, and some hardware tools. Now I am going to be 100% honest. 98% of the people in this swapa-rama are mexicans. Basically, you save alot of money in airfare to a foriegn country even though it may be cheap. Yes. You landed yourself in Mexico as you set foot into this location. Who cares if you can speak spanish or not because green money is everyones language in this little market place. They are not using pesos. I can tell you I ran across three to five non-mexican vendors at this swapa-rama, \u00a0so diversity prevails here as well. Why do you think I had written 98% \u00a0and not the other 2 %? \u00a0Today I had an Italian-American guy sell me some roach gel chemical that has 11 ingrediants to kill those bugs for a year. And I bought a T-Shirt from some Indian Hindu guy on the front of the swapa-rama building. I spent a total of $40.00. An arabic guy runs the computer-security-fix it shop in the back. Not far from mexican cheesemakers, you will see African american vendors. The vendor who sold me the RC \u00a0Helicoptor was a Uzbeki. \u00a0Those are the 2% ers. There is an American guy by the spanish magazine section next to the jewlry items who sells collectible coins and stamps. He has some bargains if you are a coin/stamp \u00a0collector .Anyways, vendors come and go. I had also looked for appliances. Since I manage properties , I had been looking for a bargain \u00a0air condition. Having some mexican tenants, tenants sometimes would sell their stove for a cheaper one so they could pay difference in rent. Why do you think I now go to swapa rama for the appliances? I buy the same item for a cheap price and not lose a dime from them ripping me off from buying a newer item from a place like ABT appliances/electronics. Anyhow, I didnt need to buy a stove. I found out you could get a stove here for $125.00 instead of $450.00. Swapa-rama can be LIKE A GIANT CRAIGLIST UNDER THE FREE SECTION OR SELL MY JUNK SECTION. Instead of driving to a location from craiglist, you have all of the inventory layed out for you. Today, I saw some people selling those large power generators used to power a home in case of an energy loss. The vendor requested a price of $2100.00 for one large generator. Who would want to pay for this amount of money if you dont have manufactures warranty? Lol. Haha. \u00a0If you can fix it; you can haggle him the price for a lower amount. I also saw refrigerators, lawn mowers, air conditions, stoves, snow blowers, jack hammers, and cement cutters. They had alot of expensive used hardware tools. And of course, you will discover mexican fashion and cuisine. I feel the biggest con would be keeping the produce in a not controlled environment because you have so many flies around the sweet fruit items. They need large freezers. Sometimes I think the produce can attract a rodent population if not in control. I also saw the famous bicycle yard. And I didnt see any expensive bikes but older 10 speed models from 15 years ago . There was alot of kids bikes....A few years ago, I heard some people were busted at this swapa rama for pirated software. Now we dont have to worry about pirated software because of open source code software availabilty for free on the net. Lol. Haha. In the back, I saw something of interest. They had cute ponies in the back parking lot area. The little horses were cute and precious. It made my day at this swapa-rama seeing them. The mexican people were charging parents for their children to get a ride on the little ponies.... I wish I was a kid .....I am not going to fit riding those little ponies. Lol. Ha. Anyways, I didnt get a chance to try some of the cuisine in this market but next time. Oh if you are worried about someone robbing your car as you leave to the market place, put alot of unappealing junk around your dashboard.

A 2-pack of camouflage tank tops for $2 (I bought a bunch of them as gifts for members of our morning YMCA boot camp class). Very cool Lady Gaga-esque Virgin Mary-meets-Death statue for $25 which I really, really wanted but found out that Santa Muerte or \"St. Death\" is used in satanic rituals and that scared me a little bit! Plus, the 8 year old kid trying to encourage me to buy it was way to excited about the satanic connection. His dad was a little creepy too. Siiiigh, so I passed. It would have made a really cool decorative piece in my living room, though. However, I didn't want to encourage demons to enter my house a la Paranormal Activity! So, I stuck with the fun stuff: a kitchy Jesus bracelet (to reverse some of that Santa Muerte vibe), cheap sunglasses, and a cute little parasol ($4) to protect myself from the sun since it was so friggin hot that day. The cute little Asian lady in the middle of the market has the cool parasols and cheap tank tops. She has a whole bunch of cheap mass produced stuff.

Most importantly, there is comfortable seating scattered all over the place - we're talking cloth and leather seats and couches. This is fantastic.

I found a couple of guitars that he was kind enough to demonstrate the performance with one of his own songs. Wow! And, again, this was done because Drew has a passion for music and wanted to share that with my gf and I. Thanks Drew!! Oh, and Drew can play, play, play guitar well. His playing was inspirational as he passed me the model and I carefully placed my fingers to slowly strike a C chord lol. Well, gotta start somewhere so I might as well start at the beginning with a great sounding guitar with a great resource like CME to back me up in a time of need. Thanks Drew and CME!!

Every time, I went to the Starbucks next door and two times I used that Starbucks bathroom without buying anything. Once I walked by at night (really deep in conversation about Neko Case for two people who never listened to Neko Case) and waved to the empty store. At this point I feel I transcended from \"customer\" to \"maybe worst customer ever\" and I'm here as a form of penance.May 2013, I turned into two windows before walking into the actual entrance. I'd sincerely like to know if anyone else has done this. It is a very big store. I was with a boy who let me join his band, which I found on craigslist, even though I had no experience playing bass or being in a band. I asked a guy where the basses were - at that point they were not in the \"bassment,\" a concept I found clever - and he brought us to a back room where, he explained, he was filming a music video though he seemed very confused about it. He handed me a thing & I didn't know what to do so I said \"maybe something much less expensive\" and he took back the thing & said something about how \"this one's made in Mexico\" which seemed super seedy to me but my friend nodded & I took the bass and said \"thanks\" & plugged it in but still lost so I stalled until he'd run through 12 iterations of \"can I help you with literally anything else\" and left & I played a self conscious version of \"Tiger Lamp,\" the only song I remembered for the band I was suddenly a part of. My friend played every Joy Division song he knew while the confused guy popped in habitually as if we were hospital patients, and I self-consciously felt like a hospital patient. He said I could have a black guitar or a sunburst guitar, and my friend said I wanted the sunburst, but I wanted the black one very badly and when they put it in a box, I carried it all the way home and this was a metaphor for our relationship. We walked for three hours trying to find the zoo and it started raining. We ended up kissing but that was the only time. I do not recommend kissing a bandmate, especially if it's just because you're confused about your feelings for your ex-boyfriend. That is not to say I don't condone following your heart, though. I condone following your heart.September 2013, I was dropping off my Orange Crush after it started making noises like it had a cold. The guy with the ponytail downstairs said he could not fix it because the individual parts were cheaply made in China. My mouth became dry until he continued, his back to me as he walked into the dark part of the repair room, \"so I'll just grab you a new one.\" And he said I'd wait upstairs, where a guy was playing the same Joy Division songs from May & I took a picture, and they carried the new amp to my mom's car, and Chloe said \"Caitlin did you know there is actual dirt on your back seat,\" and we listened to a mix CD from 2011 that had a Led Zeppelin song on it that Scott Cortez later made fun of in the dirty back seat.February 2014, the amp was having problems again. It is gray outside when the sun is even out and I'm sleeping only in three-hour intervals - I don't look forward to practice until I get there and I'm daunted by everything on the internet. I wanted to forget my Orange Crush, buying something else on craigslist, but I thought maybe I would just take the dead amp carcass back to the practice space to deteriorate. The ponytail guy was working and said, Caitlin, right? With the Orange Crush. This happened a lot. Caitlin, right? I talked to you on the phone. Caitlin, right? I'm the sales manager. I feel this was bad news and I was probably being talked about snidely. Ponytail guy said he'd get Alex, and a guy near the dark part of the repair room started playing a Mark Kozelek-ish song & making forceful eye contact with me while another guy off to the side shifted his glances between the two of us. I watched upstairs as Alex & other employees, including several managers, including a guy in a deep V who repeatedly asked me if I was okay, seemed to orbit in an augmented pace around the store looking for my amp. \"I can just come back...\" But the manager gave me this look like he was about to cry and said he would \"hate for that to happen,\" in a way that seemed non-negotiable. Just wait 5 minutes, just give me 5 minutes, here's what we're gonna do, he told me. We're gonna give you the 50 watt, it's about the same speaker size... is that okay with you? And we're going to get you a nice t-shirt for your troubles. I plugged a Mustang into the (much larger and much nicer) Orange Crush in the bassment as my hands shook fiercely like the day after I bought my own Mustang when I learned all about following your heart and rounded out all nine of those months by playing \"Tiger Lamp\" as confidently as I had ever done a thing in my life.

I've taken over a dozen guitars there for re-setting, re-stringing or re-habbing. A recent doubleneck purchase was given 4 new pickups at the recommendation of the staff, and they sound fantastic. A bass repair required an innovative fabrication that solved a serious problem without damaging the vintage quality of the instrument.

Yes, this is a place where professional musicians spend their days off and music aficionados from abroad (i.e. Italy) show up out of the blue in awe.

I found a couple of guitars that he was kind enough to demonstrate the performance with one of his own songs. Wow! And, again, this was done because Drew has a passion for music and wanted to share that with my gf and I. Thanks Drew!! Oh, and Drew can play, play, play guitar well. His playing was inspirational as he passed me the model and I carefully placed my fingers to slowly strike a C chord lol. Well, gotta start somewhere so I might as well start at the beginning with a great sounding guitar with a great resource like CME to back me up in a time of need. Thanks Drew and CME!!

I took my 1976 Fender Quad here when I first moved to Chicago. The turnover was about two weeks, nothing crazy, but when I got it back, the thing ROARED. I'm not one to write a yelp review when I'm high on my own satisfaction, so I wait until I can be more pragmatic about the place.September 6th, I dropped off a '72 Electro Harmonix Small Stone just to have it true-bypassed and eliminate the volume drop. It took 2 months and eleven days, when I received it back on November 20th. Ridiculous. I hardly had contact and was really frustrated. Every time I called, I heard they were working on it, but that the year of the pedal was hard to do the simple mods I wanted. I get the pedal back to being the most MIND BLOWING pedal I've ever heard. It really is so unique and beautiful sounding. The quality was so fantastic that it outweighed even the ridiculous wait I had. I later found out that the pedal was very hard to mod due to the age and once I plugged it in, all was forgiven.

Even after I had given them the money for the amp and guitar, they were still cool with me just hanging around and playing tons of pedals through my new amp.When I was only spending a few bucks on a pedal a while ago (probably 1/20 of their monthly revenue) they were more than willing to help in whatever way I needed (they even let me play of vintage 57' Fender Stratocaster for shits and giggles).

I emailed them ahead of time and had it somewhat worked out. I probably could have made more money by selling them on Craigslist or ebay, but I honestly tried for a long time, and I had no buyers. So after some thought, these guys were willing to step up and make the trade for an item I wanted, so I went for it. So when I arrived they checked out the items I brought and all was well. It took awhile because it was on Saturday and they were busy. I got my paper work and they shipped me the item (It was out of stock everywhere). They also shipped me a gig bag for free. Zero money was exchanged. I was very happy with the deal, I initially felt like I could be getting ripped off, but no one was making me do the deal. I could have said no, and again I tried to sell the items but they were just not selling. So I felt I got a good deal, because I wanted the item, and they made it happen. The next time you want something there, try doing a trade? They maybe able to help you. Also, just a word on the store. WOW. I mean WOW. You do not see collections like this anywhere. It is really unbelievable and overwhelming. Everyone I dealt with or spoke to was nice and polite.

It's also the former meat packing capital of the country up until the 1960s (and not in the N. Halsted way). The Union Stock Yards were founded back in 1865 and were the inspiration for Upton Sinclair's bestselling novel \"The Jungle\". The original stockyard gates still stand + there's a large plot of stacked old rail cars ...On a humid/rainy night you can still smell meat.Isn't that charming? We passed by a handful of Mexican restaurants, in the predominantly Mexican neighborhood. The most promising being La CeCina, located @ 1934 W. 47th St. ...Full of neon, black gates over the windows and signs I couldn't read (aside from \"pollo\" this/\"pollo\" that) ...I said \"promising,\" right? Well, it was packed ...Generally good sign.We found parking right away + went inside where we were greeted by Amy Winehouse's Mexican twin who quickly showed us a table amongst the blaringly bright blue walls. Within seconds we had chips and a mortar of red salsa. The chips were warm + the salsa had a nice kick. We were impressed + I chose to overlook the Costco-sized bottle of Heinz ketchup by my side.I ordered the \"burrito vegetariano\" which promised \"rice, tomato, lettuce, beans, avocado, pico de gallo\" and per request no queso or crema. I added a horchata + Mike ordered the same but with carrot juice (which he was happy about since the last burrito spot didn't offer it). The menu was surprisingly extensive ...Everything from breakfast options, pastas, soups/salads, fish/whole fish, carnes rojas, aves, cocteles (shrimp, oysters + a combo of both) + the usual standards (quesadillas, tacos, tortas). The house specialty is CeCina Estilo Guerrero: \"grilled thin steak served w/ guacamole, pico de gallo, whole pinto beans + homemade tortillas\".Quick tip when ordering horchata: Always ask for a LARGE ...Otherwise, you'll get a standard plastic Pepsi cup. Though oddly enough when ordering carrot juice this rule doesn't apply because it automatically arrives in a Big Gulp sized container.That said, always ask for LARGE when ordering horchata at La CeCina because it's honestly the best I've had ...possibly ever. It was what horchata should be: homemade/fresh and with flecks of spice.La CeCina promotes itself as a \"family restaurant,\" and while we waited for our food we couldn't help but notice that every other table was full of just that, families. Kids were dancing in front of the jukebox (Let's just say that someone was a little heavy handed with the ol quarters + their love for Selena).Senorita Winehouse arrived with our food in good time (I had tamed the lions in my stomach with my horchata + warm chips).Ok, do you remember as a child being in any sort of required school recital? For me I was in kindergarten showing of Stone Soup. I played \"Villager #2\" or \"potato girl\". Dressed like an extra from \"Little House On the Prairie. Afterwards, a horribly shy child way back when, I remember my Mom fawning all over me as my cheeks grew hot + I wanted to cry into my bonnet.\"You were great, honey!\" my Mother said ...In that somewhat wavering tone. The same tone she would use years later when I got my first pimple ...Smack-dab in the middle of my forehead, like some angry red third eyeball. \"I can hardly notice, Mandy!\".La CeCina's burrito: \"It was great ...\". Honestly? It sufficed ...I couldn't find the avocado (though Mike later swore it was there), standard iceberg lettuce (namely the white parts), the tomatoes were fresh and the beans were a pale purple w/ the consistency of toothpaste. The tortilla was the saving grace: homemade, warm and crisp with a nice chew. Bonus: No Grease.Mike \"loved,\" his burrito + commented that he preferred the setting, \"It looks like they really put a lot of work into this place to make it their own.\" We sat for awhile (Mike had a lot of carrot juice to drink) ...Senorita Winehouse cleared the table + asked how everything was ...In unison with phony grins, Mike + I said \"It was great!\".It was ok and luckily the price was right, our meal totaled under $10, without tip (And yes, we did tip).Before leaving, I ordered a LARGE horchata to go ...Which I happily slurped down amidst fireworks, car horns honking, torrential downpour + the bright lights of Chicago's skyline.I would go back for the LARGE horchata on even the most humid, rainy + meat-reeking day.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 7, 10]}, "3": {"description": "*Note* They took the awning off so you might miss it like we did.

My boyfriend and I tend to drive out here randomly when the mood strikes, it's even been known that on days where I've had flailing job interviews or am generally feeling down in the dumps, taking a trip to Cecina makes me feel better. I'm crazy for chile rellenos. I tend to gauge my favorite Mexican places on if they have that or how good it is. La Cecina has my FAVORITE chile rellenos EVER. I don't know what it is, but it's just the most perfect plate of food I have ever laid my eyes on. Better than Nuevo Leon in Pilsen, which is another go-to when going down to the south side can't cut it for the day. The service is fantastic, I speak spotty/sad Spanish and I've always had waitresses who make me feel welcome even if I'm speaking English/said spotty Spanish. They're very professional and generally excellent, the owner of the restaurant should feel lucky to have such commendable staff. It is notable that one time I came in here with my boyfriend and his family and ordered mole enchiladas, which is generally the opposite direction of where I usually go when I eat but hey, why not. When the enchiladas came out to me there was a waft of burnt-smell. The mole sauce was torched, like insanely burnt it wasn't even edible. The wondrous servers I mentioned took it back and replaced them with red enchiladas no problem, but I suppose the chefs might wanna think twice before trying to get away serving burnt food.
