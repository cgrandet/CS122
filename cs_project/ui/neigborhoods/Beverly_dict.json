One of the employees stood with us by an open chest refrigerator in the back and allowed us to try practically every mead they sell. That was cool. There were a number of unique flavors, my favorite being the Pirate's Blood, which has a deep color and is infused with hot peppers. The combination of sweet and heat works for me. Their \"tasting room\" is also their office, and it was very small and crowded. The employee who was helping us with the tasting told us they are moving to a larger space with a warehouse, a real tasting room and possibly space for a banquet hall.Wild Blossom was very hard to find. They are on the East side of Western Ave. between 100th and 101st street in Beverly. There is no sign out front. They share space with the Bevart brewer supply company, which has it's name on the door, but there is no awning or anything to alert a driver passing by that they are there. \u00a0Better signage at the new location will go a long way. Also, Beverly is a dry neighborhood, so when we asked to purchase wine, we were directed to the sketchy liquor store on the other side of Western, which is apparently in a different neighborhood. Parking is free on the street and was plentiful, at least on Sunday.Enjoyed the afternoon, but probably won't make a return trip. If I find them in a local liquor store I would buy their mead again.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 8, 20]}, "1": {"description": "Went yesterday to do a tasting with the ladies. The wines were amazing! We were able to each sample about 6 wines. The tasting itself includes 5 but if you wanted to sample another they were completely okay with that. It's recommended you don't try too many because the flavors tend to blend together. I'm looking forward to the tasting room opening which is close to this location but your able to purchase the wines there. The downfall was if we wanted to purchase any we have to go to either binnys or the store which was near.

Chicago has a meadery, its name is Wild Blossom, and they make a damn fine mead, or two, or ten.Wild Blossom Meadery operates out of the brewing supply shop Beverage Art on Western Avenue in Beverly. I'd read about their mead (honey wine) in a couple of \u00a0places within a short span of time and was stirred to find out whether they did tastings or anything of that nature. I called to find out; it took a couple of calls to get in touch with Greg, the master brewer/vintner, and we set up a tasting (he apparently does all kinds of them, even for bachelorette parties etc.) A friend and I decided to truck down to Beverly to check out the goods.Greg walked us through the wares, offering us samplings of varieties \u00a0including Blanc de Fleur (a dry mead), \"Prairie Passion\" (a traditional sweeter mead; this is what I am accustomed to), plus meads flavored with pomegranate (a nice, tart flavor to offset the honey sweeteness), blueberry (a bit too intense to me), mulberry (better balance of berry and honey), hibiscus (I couldn't taste the floral note, but I'd just drunk the blueberry, so this probably needed to be done in a different order is all), chocolate (an unexpected hit with me, and he said it's good warm, which he discovered after leaving a bottle in his car where it heated up!), and \"Sweet Desire\", which is aged in bourbon casks so it attains a complex, smoky, vanilla-y accord (I LOVED this one). It was too bad that they didn't have the cran-nectar flavor in stock, but we tried a whole raft of others, so it was hard to be disappointed. They can't sell the meads in-store (due to some weird liquor zoning in the area), but a liquor store literally across the street sells the products, and they helpfully have a list of other stores (plus bars and restaurants...including Medieval Times!) in Chicagoland that carry them too. They're also available online through their web site. Prices are not sky-high, as one might expect, since they have a corner on the market; $14-18 was about average at the store across the street we went to (the one higher-priced one was the Sweet Desire, perhaps due to the longer aging? Even that one was still in the range of an affordable wine.)Greg's knowledge of his wares, mead in general, as well as honey and wildflowers is quite extensive; we learned more than we expected to on this visit. I for one do not think about the fact that beehives are on rooftops around the city; many of these bees are patiently gathering local pollen to create local honey for Wild Blossom Meadery's amazing array of products.It was a pretty casual set-up (we were just standing around in the shop's back room), and it wasn't the most relaxing experience (there was a dog barking its head off further in the back, and the phone was ringing a lot), but we did get an informative session and tried something different! My knowledge of mead has definitely been expanded. Greg said they have a mead club (you can get in on short-run meads only offered to those in the club), and they also have mead dinners paired at different local restaurants.Overall, this was quite an unusual way to spend a Monday!

When I went here there was literal HUMAN feces, excrement, bodily waste, waste matter, ordure, dung, manure, excreta, stools, droppings; dirt, filth, muck, mess, a deuce, night soil, poop pooh, doo-doo, turds, poo, caca, dookie, boo boo, sh** , \u00a0number 2 on the floor. \"Please explain the Yelper I know as Dennis B.\", you might say. \"Well I'll be more than happy to\", I reply.In order for restaurants to make as much money as possible, they'll squeeze as many tables that'll possibly fit into their dining area. At this restaurant the mens and womens bathroom are literally right off of the dining area. These geniuses decided to place a table directly in front of the bathroom entryways. So not only do you get that beautiful bathroom atmosphere, but you get to watch who goes into the bathroom, \u00a0and then look them in the eye when they exit, as well as smell what they did every time the doors open and close.So me and my wife got the privilege of sitting at this table placed directly in front of the bathroom. While I was at the table lollygagging \u00a0in daydream land, my wife tells me to help this elderly gentleman who can barely walk, with opening the door to the bathroom. But by the time I leave daydream land he's already thru the door. But then I start to smell something. I look down on the floor and their's a fresh, moist, brown with a hint of green, perfectly cylindrical human turd on the floor.I had to stop 2 waitresses, who didn't see it and later walked off in disgust, from walking in it. After about 5 minutes of that beautiful turd smell permeating the smell of my meal, the manager has a dishwasher come out from the back to clean it up. Because of that they lose a star on my yelp review. The manager should of cleaned it up himself, out of embarrasment to his customers. And I use to be a dishwasher, so out of respect for my fellow dishwasher brethren they lose another yelp review star.After all this, here comes the elderly gentleman out of the bathroom. Of course, I looked him in the eye and smelled what he did in there as I did with all the other bathroom patrons, because I didnt want anyone to fill left out and I believe in equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion, age, creed, nationality, or beliefs. From the bottom of his shoe to the top of his socks was the skid marks from the turd. So obviously he had no drawers on and that turd slid all the way down his pants leg. Someone should of been with him due to his mobility issues and he should of been wearing adult diapers. Because I had to look him in the eye upon his exiting the bathroom, and not only smell, but SEE what he did in there due to the proximity of my table to the bathroom, they lose another star.Now you'd think my meal would've been comped. IT WASNT. All I got was an apology from the manager. I still had to pay for my food even though I couldnt finish it for obvious reasons. Thats another star they lose.The food here is nothing special. They'd lose a star for that to but Almighty yelp doesnt allow that or half stars for some unexplicable, the yelp CEO must be a huge idiot, reason.I wont be going back.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 12, 29]}, "14": {"description": "This is your typical pancake house, although I would not recommend ordering anything too fancy.

First of all the only reason why I do give it 2 stars is because the drinks on off nights are more than reasonable. Other than that, if i could give a half a star for the fact that they remain open, I would. So on that note let me give you some insight into a night leading up to brewbakers. Drinking at one of the many well established pubs along western avenue so much that you don't realize that you will be encountering such shenanigans. And the only reason why you are going to Brewbakers is because all of the other bars close at 2am. Before you know it, you're stopped at the door in order to give five dollars (weekend) to the doorman. Which pains me. Then you are asked to produce ID so that they can look at the extensive blacklist they have. Now that should be the first warning sign that you may not know what you are getting yourself into. When the blacklist name list has more names than mccarthy did, there may be a problem. So after your cleared to show that you don't have a tendancy to get into a fight, you walk through the second door to get your hand stamped. And once you get past the stamper, it's a lead zeppelin from there. It's very loud, very hot, very smelly, and the music doesn't help. The guys in there all feel as though they have something to prove, which they don't. If I wanted to talk shit, or shit get talked to me I would wear a Cubs jersey to \"the cell\". The girls over there are in their own little world. And that has a double meaning. A majority of them are the size of a world. I know that the burrito station is right down the street, but that doesn't mean it's part of a nutritious breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The dj can't really be considered a \"dj\" per say. You hear a lot of repeats and songs that just utterly suck. When you just click songs off a laptop, I can't consider you a dj. I can only hear that shitty grease song one time in a night before I wanna rip someone's head off. But I digress. Go there if you only have a couple bucks in your pocket, on a weekday. Other than that your on your own. But weekdays can be sketchy too. One day I went out afterhours because I didn't get out of work till late, so I just wanted a couple of beers. Low and behold I was there for only an hour and a half, and what do I get. I walk out to go to my car and drop my buddy off, and in the middle of the street is my sideview mirror. Now come on. Who does that? My mirrors are supposed to sway as well. So that just means someone purposely ripped off my mirror and threw it in the middle of the street. If you're angry, fight a person not a car. I think this person was pissed off because the only chance of getting laid from that bar was by some chick that looked like a shaved buffalo.

I waited in line for at least 15 minutes! Once I left the store I realized there was a 40% off coupon posted on their site. So I went back into the store with my receipt and the coupon on my mobile device and waited in line yet again for another 15 minutes. Once I reached the counter, I explained to the cashier that I wanted the 40% off on the Rainbow Loom I just purchased since it was a regular priced item. And the cashier looks at my receipt and then tell me I need to bring the item back into the store. And then he said I would have to get back in line. So at this point I'm highly pissed! I go to my car to get the item and waited in line for ANOTHER 15 minutes. As soon as I reached the counter he then tells me that the Rainbow Loom is excluded from the offer. And once I read the very fine print it did state that the Rainbow Loom was excluded. I couldn't argue with that. But my issue was that when he first saw my receipt he KNEW I was inquiring about the Rainbow Loom. And the fact he made me go get the item and wait back in line just to tell me it was excluded was unbelievable!!! So now at this point I'm beyond pissed and ask to speak with a manger. I waited 45 minutes to speak with a manger! Her name was Estella and she was the night shift manager. So at this point my blood is boiling!!!! Once the manger approached me she said it took her so long because she was working with two customers in the framing department which takes time and she's the only person that can do that task. She apologized repeatedly and that wasn't enough for me. She explained that even if she tried to give me 40% of the Rainbow Loom it wouldn't go through which I believe she was lying! So she asked if I wanted to purchase anything else and receive 40% off. I immediately let her know that I would not spend another dime in that store and that on Monday morning I will be calling customer service to file a complaint.

When I called to order, I was given my total and told to give them \"a good 30 minutes\" I arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes later and gave my name to the young lady at the counter. She couldn't find my order. She asked me if I was sure that I ordered from the Beverly location, to which I answered yes. She then proceeded to ask me to tell her the phone number I called. Since I've been ordering from the place longer than the girl has been alive, I had no problem telling her that I called 239-2312 as I STILL know the number by heart. She then asked me 3 more times how to spell my name and if there was a possibility the order could be under another name, to which I continued to say NO.Thankfully there was a young man at the counter who was able to figure out what the error was on THEIR part. They sent my order out for delivery. Since I don't live in the area, I asked how that could be possible and he rattled off an address. I said \"oh yes, that would be a bowling alley where we previously had a party for one of my son's sports teams, I don't live there.\" Side note: I did order about 10 family size pizzas for that party and the parties held there previously.The young man informed me that the driver just left and he would call him to tell him to come back. They seemed to be disinterested in me any further until the young lady offered me a free 2 liter of pop which I declined. \u00a0I conversed with other customers in the waiting area who were also shocked at their nonchalance of their error because at this point, no apology had been provided.

NO!\" I asked the young man if I could speak to the person in charge and he said he would get the manager.The woman came to the counter and as I attempted to explain what happened, she interrupted me and said she was aware. That's funny, if she was aware, why didn't she address ME?? Why did I have to ask to speak with her?? At any rate, I asked why there was no offer to make me a fresh pizza. She responded that they were busy and that would take at least 30 minutes. She then issued the first apology and asked me, \"What do you want me to do, give you a discount?!?\" I said NO. She then rang up a total which was about $5 less than the initial total I was provided over the phone. At this point, the driver came in and plopped my pizza on the counter which was 15 minutes AFTER I walked in to pick it up. \u00a0I said to the manager, \"Now I'm paying for a cold pizza.\" Her snippy comment was, \"it was in a box.\" Why didn't I walk out without the pizza?? Because I had two hungry children with me who already waited 45 minutes.

They also didn't come with dipping sauces. That was more a surprise than a disappointment because I had plenty of sauces. The pizza was tangy with plenty of chicken and barbecue sauce.

On the night we were there- there was some kind of a \"girls night\" out thing going on- which made for some really drunk women wandering around the bar, which could have been tragic if they hadn't been just so darn funny! One girl walked around the bar with her boyfriend's hand down the back of her jeans. Wasn't sure what he was doing but I'm going to chalk it up to him trying to keep her vertical!!

I disagree that I was angry as you assert in your 10/31/15 post. I simply suggested that customers learn from my mistake, and research their purchase before buying items at a higher cost. I do not own a pair of Jordan's nor a $2500 handbag, but should I find myself in the market for such, I will definitely do my research as you suggest. I work hard for my income, as I'm sure you do as well, and I am not inclined to spend 70% more for an item if it can be acquired for less. Fair pricing is what the dispute is regarding. Just because an item is offered online, does not automatically mean the establishment is not brick and mortar(B&M). There are numerous B&M shops that utilize online services, be it minority owned or not. Nubian Nation, a minority owned business on Vincennes, carries many of the same items at a far lower cost. I'm sure his overhead is equal to, if not much higher, as this is a standalone building with more square footage than Alpha to Omega(A2O). Although price matching is not posted, when asked, he stated he would work with the customer to make the deal a fair exchange for both.  Again, as stated in my previous post, I was at an out of state conference where A2O had a table set up. The opportunity to do \"Legwork\" was not available. I was assured by the vendor that this was a sale price, offered for less than what was available in the store, because I inquired if the item could be purchased at the store, so that I would not have to carry it through the conference.As price is a deciding factor in my purchases, I will do my due diligence before purchasing in the future.

Stores are not obligated to price match. Stores that do this are usually larger retail chains (i.e. Best Buy, WalMart, Target, etc.). A small business such as Alpha II Omega does not have the benefit of spreading overhead cost over many locations so this makes price matching very difficult for small businesses to do. Also, he mentions that he saw the product online at a cheaper price. Everyone knows that overhead for an online shop is much lower than that of a brick-and-mortar store. I am certain that the pricing structure at Alpha II Omega is not set up to \"take advantage of customers\" as this gentleman so hastily accuses. They have to charge the right price so that they can pay their the rent and their employees. Alpha II Omega has a 25-year track record of serving the community. Myself and the many other \u00a0devoted customers will continue to support this amazing business. Also, if price is so important to this gentleman \u00a0he should use his energy to do the legwork to find items that meet his price-point expectations and not bash a great business.

Then again, it was early on a rainy Monday morning. Our server was a bit slow to greet us after we seated ourselves and seemed kinda grim. That took some of the joy out of returning here after so many years since I would have preferred fireworks going off when I walked in the door... but whatever. Nothing was gonna stop me from enjoying this burger.THE FOODI ordered my all time favorite burger - the Patty Melt. I first fell in love with this burger down the street at the Walgreen's in Evergreen Plaza. Those were the days when some Walgreen's had a diner attached. But it was here where I became addicted and I couldn't wait to get my fix. My family order breakfast items.* The Patty Melt (3.75 stars) was perfectly sandwiched between two grilled sliced of rye bread, two glorious slices of American cheese and the perfect amount of grilled onions. Ahhhh, heaven. \u00a0The french fries weren't that great but my main reason for coming was the burger. It was delicious, but I seem to remember it tasting better back in the days when I was a regular.* The pancakes were HUGE (4 stars). Unbelievably thick!!! My kids split a stack of three that could easily have been 6 at any other restaurant. I don't normally like pancakes this thick, but they managed to make me a believer.* Egg & Cheese sandwich on grilled rye bread with turkey bacon gave my wife pleasure (4 stars). She really loved the pancakes too and said she would love to come back here on our next visit. This type of praise from her is rare. \u00a0 THE VERDICTAlways a great choice, just not as much of a favorite as it once was. Too bad we didn't arrive on Friday as we originally planned. I was told by the store manager the Food Network was here filming a new series on that day which highlights America's famous burger houses around the country. What an amazing experience that would have been for my kids as I rediscovered my childhood food addiction.

My boyfriend and I went, it was held at the Marriot in downtown Chicago in a ballroom type area. In the beginning, you mix and make your own wine (red) and get to do a tasting. After that, they let you bottle it, teach you to cork it, and even put the top plastic part on it by using a machine to melt it. It was pretty cool to learn the bottling process. They also had several other wines available (red and white) to drink, as well. So people were drinking and getting loosened up prior to the actual wine making. After that, we went inside to a classroom type area and learned how they made wine and about where they actually grow their grapes. It was cool, a little too informative, but that is only my opinion, several people enjoyed the process, however, a lot of people took advantage of the drinks in the beginning and didn't have the patience for it. So that could go either way. The concept, i will say was very cool. After the presentation, we started making our own wine (we got to pre-order whatever we wanted) we chose a pinot grigio. We used water and followed the instructions, pour in ingredients, stir etc. It was pretty cool. This lasted about 30 minutes. People were continuing to drink and the couple next to us was really fun so the experience was getting even better.Later, we moved back into the room at the Marriott and had a grape stomping contest. At this point, you could kind of separate the classier people vs. a few of trashier people that attended (it was mostly classy, young couples looking to have fun) but during the grape stomping, a few drunk girls were falling out of the bucket, being dramatic, crying. I mean, c'mon girls, keep it together. I felt bad for Bev Art's staff. I would have done this before we did the wine making, as people weren't as drunk yet and things wouldn't have been so out of control (not the companies fault, just the timing and the people not being able to control their liquor). This is my only critique of the night. They also gave us boxers that we could put on to stomp so we don't get dirty and boas and were able to take them home which was cute. As we moved on to dinner, there was extra wine that they actually let us take home. There was one wine of theirs that I loved and I was able to take it home which I thought was very cool!

Drinks werent included but for the price of everything, this was okay and totally acceptable.This was over by around 10:30 pm so we were still able to meet up with another couple afterwards. The best part about all of this is that it cost us (for two people the entire night) a total of about $350-$375. This included the drinks, four course meal, wine tasting, wine educational portion, and the wine we made. The wine we made will make 25-30 bottles of wine that we will get to keep once it is ready and bottled! The wine alone, pays for itself, not to mention everything else we got to do!At the end of the day, I would definitely recommend this company and their activities.

Being understaffed wouldn't be that big a deal if these two, along with others helped their coworkers. Keep in mind after these incidents we witnessed both these employees helping with running of drinks, clearing tables & running food. Our server seemed to be the only one on the floor with at least 12 tables. \u00a0He was weeded and needed help and his coworkers or manager (if there was one working at the time ? ) were MIA.

We went on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm to try their beers and have some dinner. I had the Kitchen Sink and an IPA. I thought both were decent, but nothing over the top. We had ordered our beers and dinner at the bar before deciding to move to a table to eat. So we got to our table with half of a beer each and our food came shortly after. My husband had ordered the Fat Chef with fries and ranch and I got the Gastro flatbread with a side of mac & cheese. Our fries and mac & cheese both came cold. Which was disappointing. My flatbread was really good. The pork was only ok, but I'm a sucker for goat cheese, pickled onions and arugula so it was likely going to be a winner for me no matter what. OH!! And their ranch was probably one of the best ranch dressings I've ever had. And I'm obsessed with ranch, so that says a lot. However, our server Mark was nowhere to be found through the whole dinner. We both needed another beer and had eventually moved our empty glasses to the end of the table before he came around. By the time we got our beers we were basically done with dinner and ready to go.

The bill came, we signed and were ready to go. 10 minutes later still no growler.... 10 minutes later still no growler... finally I had to flag Mark down as if our growler was ready yet.

The service is great. The food is great. It's pub food, but some dishes have a nice twist. And it caters to the needs of any crowd you decide to bring, your parents, your friends, your S.O. or the kiddies. Some people may not like kids in a brewery, but I like that I can come with my friends and sit at the bar some days and also bring my nieces for lunch when I need a break and a brew. Let's break it down.Booze: You may not like all their offerings, but you will find the beer for you. You can look on the chalkboard, or read the menu for a more comprehensive profile. I've had their \"fruity\" beers. \u00a0They're not weak soda/juice like beers. The purple cow they had a while back packed a punch, and the Pink Pom Pom was tart and bubbly and I love it. It's just so good when it hits your lips. I appreciated them making a beer brewed with cherries and not one that was brewed and later mixed with cherry soda flavor. You can tell the difference. Have a Bloody Martyr, their take on the Bloody Mary. It's spicy and comes with a salami, pepper jack garnish.Food: Crab. Cakes. CRAB CAKES. They're doing it right. It's a ton of crab with a light breading. \u00a0Thanks for not making a ball of dough with a bit of crab sprinkled in. The sweet tomato jam and honey mustard aioli it was dressed with was on another level. The salads...meh. I like a salad that's properly dressed. I get that people like their dressing on the side, but they are stupid, so don't cater to them. Toss that lettuce in a bowl with a vinaigrette and call it a day. I had the Norcal. Nice combo. Chicken was juicy, blue cheese had a great nutty flavor, but my dressing was a glob of garlic on garlic on garlic. It killed it. The dressing needs an intervention. And salt your greens! I know I could just salt my food, and it's better to underseason than over do it, but I wanna take a bite and say yum, not take a bite and start adjusting. \u00a0Service and Ambiance: The brewery is obviously pretty big, you won't get lost, it's a wide open space, but the high ceilings and table set up may overwhelm someone on their first visit. So thanks for having a friendly greeter. They've got alot of great artwork on the wall and this week's theme was horses. They. Were. Every. Where. Which is cool. I mean, it is called Horse Thief Hollow. Speaking of art, \u00a0check out the map in the parking lot (free parking) of all the Chicago neighborhoods in neon. \u00a0Very cool. And thanks for having a great bartender. So many places have surly guys who couldn't be more annoyed with you when you order a cocktail or they never look up to take your order. They just stand their making an old fashioned with a pained look on their face wishing you'd go away. Not here. Our bartender was attentive, \u00a0polite and helpful. I wish I knew his name. He had an awesome beard and 'stache. I'll get it next time.So sit at the bar with a buddy, sit at a table with your kids, you're gonna have a good brew, good food and an overall good experience in Beverly.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 16]}, "1": {"description": "Waiter messes up flights of beer - have no idea what you are drinking - resulting in miss order pintMedium burger burnt to crispIce cold crab cakesWaiters snotty nose inserted into each beer sample as he tried to figure out each mislabeled beer sampleGo bullfrogs!!", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 11, 27]}, "55": {"description": "As a consumer of craft beer, I appreciate HTH a lot because they still maintain normalcy in a scene which has gotten creepy, weird, and too big.

My theory as to why the surrounding neighborhood loves this place has to be the fact that they see their friends/neighbors/family there and can catch up with them. Quality from top to bottom is less than any significantly more casual Italian chain. Starting from the moment we walked in the hostess stand was not professional. I mean they take reservations written down on a yellow legal pad. The gentleman taking us to our seat was preoccupied with the valet attendant whom had some sort of issue with the vehicle ahead of ours. Nonetheless the host was not very inviting nor enthusiastic. We were seated upstairs which was bright, very loud due to poor construction of the room, and looked like a small reception room. It was not very aesthetically appeasing and had zero ambience. Our server came over quickly with menus and said he'd be back shortly. When he arrived I asked for a drink menu so he referred to the food menu with all the wine and beer selections. The wine list was by the bottle only and had no mention of selections by the glass. I asked about a martini list and his response was \"we don't have any martini's but I guess we could make one.\" That sort of threw me off since the Yelp review pictures had several posted of martini's. Anyway she decided on a glass of wine instead. On to the food. I started with a Caesar salad which was ok. The romaine for the salad was left in stalks and the croutons were the size of blocks-way too much work for an average salad. Entrees were Gnocchi and Chicken Marsala. Our plan was to share. She tasted the chicken first which yielded a less than pleasant facial reaction. \"Here taste this\" she says. Never the question you want to hear at a restaurant when someone's face looks borderline disgusted. Well I taste and inmediately understand why the facial contortions occurred as I did the same. The chicken was old/bad/rotten whatever you want to call it. And they used canned mushrooms for it. That's cheap and lazy.

Seriously picture perfect, exactly what I wanted, couldn't have been better. Maybe one of my favorite parts of my wedding.However, my bouquet was all wrong. When we had our first meeting with The Blossom Boys, I brought in 6 pictures of bouquets I liked. 5 of the 6 were of tight, mounded style bouquets, and 1 was a looser garden-style. I explained, I wanted the mounded style, but I included the other picture because I liked it's colors. I said specifically I don't like bouquets with alot of green leafy filler in them. When we went back for our second meeting to hear their proposal, they had me down for a loose garden-style bouquet. I corrected them, and watched him make the change on the paper. Months later, when we made our final payment, I checked AGAIN that they had me down for a mounded-style bouquet; and they did. However, when the flowers showed up on the wedding day; my bouquet was in a loose garden style with all sorts of extra green buds shooting out of it. My dad and one of my bridesmaids spent a few minutes snipping all the green things off, and it helped ALOT but I still didn't really care for the overall look of it.Additionally, the shop could be very difficult to get a hold of at times. They also made a mistake and tried to double charge us the delivery fee. Also, our wedding was two weeks ago, we made the final payment two weeks before that, but TODAY they replied to a month old email asking when we could come by to drop off our last check.

But there are a lot of inspiring items here, including droves of cookie cutters. I don't even make rolled cookies, but I wanted to buy all of them. So if you're into decorating and you're not an old pro yet, check this place out. I've always found the staff (who I'm pretty sure is just the owner and her husband?) to be very helpful and friendly. They offer classes here, too, including an \"adult cake\" class you won't find at Joann's.", "rating": "4", "date": [2006, 11, 26]}, "1": {"description": "This review is solely related to the chocolate making class. I saw a Living Social deal for $27 (regularly $55) for a chocolate making class and thought that sounded like a really cool idea. Unfortunately, the chocolate making class was more of a chocolate dipping/chocolate molding class with most of the time devoted to waiting for our chocolate to harden in the freezer. I'd say there was one good thing about the class: the woman who taught the class was really sweet. We had a few people in our group who waited too long to buy the Living Social deal, but she allowed them to join anyway. The same problem has happened to me in the past for other activities in Chicago and I thought it was super generous of her to let the rest of our group in for the Living Social price. That is why this review gets 2 stars instead of 1. I knew I was in trouble when she started \u00a0the class with \"I've never done this before.\" I wanted to hope for the best at that point, but I felt an ominous sense that things were going to get worse (spoiler alert: they did). Following this revelation, she spent 20 minutes talking about the products they sell to make chocolate and then verbally telling us how to use them to make chocolate, but we NEVER made any chocolate. Instead, there were several crock pots filled with melted chocolate that we used for the class. It was also disappointing to know that they sell 4 different kinds of chips to make chocolate (white, dark, milk, and mint), but we only used two during the class. Following the verbal demonstration, we filled 6 small molds, dipped a pretzel and twizzler, and made a cracker and Oreo chocolate confection. We also learned how to make a turtle, which was the coolest part of the class. Unfortunately, we were provided with mixed nuts rather than what turtles are normally made out of (e.g., cashews). They say the class is 2 hours, but the class (with the 20 minute instruction) takes between 45-60 minutes. What do you do the rest of the time? You wait your turn to put your molds into the freezer because they don't have a big enough one for the class (this would have been true even if the extra people were not let into the class). I think that this is a REALLY neat idea, which is why I bought the deal. Unfortunately, they need to seriously consider how to present this in the future if they want to continue offering this class.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 6, 29]}, "9": {"description": "I've been there twice for cake toppers that they didn't have.

Suffice to say, we'd probably eat there every day if humanly possible. No, really. It was THAT incredible.I figured a plain sweet potato would curb my hunger but otherwise be...boring. This place makes sweet potatoes so good, so tender, so creamy that with the hint of brown sugar, I thought I might've died and went to food heaven. Oh, and the size of the sweet potatoes? Giant. No, really. They are enormous. And they are luscious beyond words.My husband is head over heels with the loaded sweet potatoey goodness. For one, it's absolutely a dish worth sharing (if you both consume meat and dairy, that is) or at the very least, it will serve you well for two separate meals. He's been meaning to try both the sweet potato stew and the steak sandwich on sweet potato bread, but he hasn't been able to let go of this loaded sweet potato desires.

I was wrong, you guys. I was very, very wrong.A month (or so) ago, my husband wanted to try the \"loaded sweet potato with chicken\", so I decided I'd grab a plain sweet potato with a little brown sugar on the side. Suffice to say, we'd probably eat there every day if humanly possible. No, really. It was THAT incredible.I figured a plain sweet potato would curb my hunger but otherwise be...boring. This place makes sweet potatoes so good, so tender, so creamy that with the hint of brown sugar, I thought I might've died and went to food heaven. Oh, and the size of the sweet potatoes? Giant. No, really. They are enormous. And they are luscious beyond words.My husband is head over heels with the loaded sweet potatoey goodness. For one, it's absolutely a dish worth sharing (if you both consume meat and dairy, that is) or at the very least, it will serve you well for two separate meals.

I purchased the famed honey cream cheese sweet potato pie for my friend, and the sweet potato bread pudding and banana rum cream cheese sweet potato pie for myself.

I will never dine here again! Don't get me wrong, the deep dish pizza that we ordered was good (just as good as any other Giordano's restaurant). The wait staff was lousy, nonetheless. I had to ask my waitress to refill my drink three times before she brought my first refill. When it came time for the check, I gave the waitress a Giordano's gift card and told her to put the rest on my credit card, so she took both cards. She gave me a receipt, which I signed and gave back. Then, she tells me that she needs her manager to input the gift card, at which point I should have just left since I had already paid my bill in its entirety how it was presented to me. However, the manager asked for my credit card again, and I complied. I thought he was just going to verify the signature on the back of my card, but what he did was swipe my card again. He then gives me a new receipt with a higher amount and no explanation. So, being a careful and conscious consumer using a credit card, of course I wanted to know why there was a difference in the amount. The manager started stuttering while he tried to explain (with a very heavy foreign accent) and from what I could understand of him, the waitress put in the wrong amount when closing out my bill. I would've had no complaints if the waitress or even the manager would have admitted the error and informed me that there was going to be a change in the bill amount due to said error instead of swiping my card again without my permission, however that didn't happen. I understand that everybody makes mistakes; adding and subtracting numbers was obviously not this particular waitress' strong point, but if she would have admitted her error instead of trying to hide it, things would have gone a lot smoother. (By the way, no one from the restaurant's staff ever apologized for the inconvenience, even though the mistake was made by one of the restaurant's employees.) At first, I refused to pay the difference because I was given a receipt with one price, which I paid with my credit card, and then the manager increased the amount on my bill without explaining, admitting, or even apologizing for the waitress' error! I checked my bank account using a mobile banking app, and of course the last two transactions were the two separate charges from this restaurant for the two different amounts! I asked the manager to cancel both transactions and I would pay cash, which he refused to do. I asked him to call the restaurant owner because I was sure he would resolve the issue. I WAS WRONG! He failed to ensure repeat business, lost a loyal customer and provided very poor customer service. I told him I would pay the difference even though it was not my error, but I would never come back to that restaurant. And his reply was, \"Good, because we don't want customers like you!\" Again, I got no apology for the inconvenience by either the restaurant staff or owner. I've worked in customer service a very long time; I know there are ways to talk to customers in cases like this and then there's unacceptable, rude behavior toward customers. This restaurant's staff (including the owner) exhibited the latter. I would encourage anyone who dines here, to inspect their receipts very well before paying. This restaurant's employees are con-artists, especially the restaurant manager, and they are exceedingly unprofessional, including the restaurant owner! In closing, I just want to send a message to Giordano's. If your employees make a mistake with your customers, it's okay! Just own up to it and apologize to your customers.
