If you're headed to Solider Field it is a really close walk, which is nice. I got the prosciutto waffle sandwich. I was feeling wild, you know. I wasn't really sure how it was going to turn out because it seems like the flavors wouldn't work together. I was very happily surprised. It was very tasty. The waffle wasn't so sweet that it took over the flavor of the rest of the sandwich. My guy got the turkey Rueben and it was pretty tasty as well. I was happier with my order because his little sandwich just fell apart in his hands. I got a coffee and it was just fine. I'm not going to give it more praise than that because it was just a cup of coffee. He got a hot toddy and was all about it. \u00a0I was super bummed with the sides. If you have those tasty sandwiches, having a sad little pile of Lays potato chips on the side was just underwhelming. I expected a bit more from the taste of the sandwich. It's a little odd when you walk in. You walk in to a pastry counter, but you don't order there. There's a giant chalk board with their menu on on it. We didn't know if we were supposed to sit, if we ordered up front, or what? It was just odd. We walked in to a crowd of other people who didn't really seem to understand what was going on either. You order sort of around the corner and then they bring some things to you and other things they just hand you...? I don't know, maybe I'm being a baby about it but it seemed a lot harder than it really should have been. I didn't like how I was treated when I was in. We both got treated like we were stupid when we asked if we were meant to order up front or sit first. I get that they were busy, but rudeness isn't okay. I also HATED being scolded by the waitress. She brought us a hot toddy and said \"Where's your number?\" I didn't have a clue what she was talking about. She said \"You HAVE to have a number.\" And I said I didn't have one and she rolled her eyes and went and got me one. I don't understand why I got in trouble for your weird system falling apart. Don't scold me. There's no need to ever be mean, especially in the morning, so I left with a bad taste in my mouth. All in all it was fine. The tasty sandwich saved this from being a 2-star review because of the treatment and the confusion. Convenient for a Bears game but I won't be back.

I didn't know how this place got any business because it's hidden inside Tower Residence Condos on Indiana Ave where there's little parking.

Their menu has a variety of breakfast, sandwich and drink items. I had the Banana Batter pancakes & the Red Velvet waffles on another occasion. Let me say, it's the best breakfast entree's I've had. I don't mind that I'm paying a few extra bucks for great food. There's plenty of Subways & Starbucks to eat cheap. I also liked their Happy Hour drink specials. The $5 Mint Jelups on Thursdays beat other neighborhood bar specials.The Little Branch Cafe is a prime example of what word of mouth can do for a business. Obviously, the locals are aware of it.

She said \"You HAVE to have a number.\" And I said I didn't have one and she rolled her eyes and went and got me one. I don't understand why I got in trouble for your weird system falling apart. Don't scold me. There's no need to ever be mean, especially in the morning, so I left with a bad taste in my mouth. All in all it was fine.

Well, the good coffee/food isn't worth the bad service. Here are a few things that happened and you can call it for yourself.1. I wanted a half-caff small coffee when I was preggo and they made me purchase 2 small coffees (one caffeinated and one decaf) that I could mix together myself. I'd understand if they brewed each cup individually, but we're talking pre-brewed carafe's here, so why all the extra ridiculousness?2. I ordered a hot panini that included roast beef, cheddar, horseradish and pickled onions. It came without the onions or cheese- the bread was hot and the roast beef was as cold as the refrigerator. When I asked the waitress if the order could be fixed, she brought me out some raw red onions and a cold piece of cheese on a plate.3. The owner is rude. 4. I ordered a latte that was supposed to come with 3 shots of syrup. I only wanted 2, but wanted one shot of vanilla and one of blueberry. The owner rang up each part of the drink a la carte-totaling more than $2 in excess of the listed price. I figured it was a mistake, but when she tried to justify charging me almost 2 extra dollars for my latte, I realized that some major logic was being lost. It was at the point when she raised her voice to a disrespectful \"Do you want it or not?!\", that I decided not to come back. 5. Refer to #3.

If i had not been contaminated by Basia who was careless and unprofessional enough to cough around customers and make them sick while denying she is sick, i would not have updated this review. i remember i had a 70+ year old Esthetician long time ago whose husband was literally dying from cancer and who was always incredibly professional and nice everytime, even after he passed away....We all have worries in our lives, and when i go there i have my own worries too, and you do too. it does NOT justify taking them out on your customers, ESPECIALLY a long time one. This is just entitled, spoiled behavior. When you are unable to deal with stress and work at the same time, you stay at home. When you are SICK, you wear something to cover your mouth or you inform your customer, or you stay at home. This is all just so unprofessional and ridiculous.

Anyway, after this back and forth for what seemed like forever, we stuck to our guns and got our own flights.There was a chalk-written sign, so I thought I was safe ordering from there. (I mean, when most places sell out of something, they simply cross it out or wipe it off.) Anyway, I ordered my first beer of the flight. She snaps at me \"we don't have that.\" ...um..OK... So I order my second choice (technically my first now). \"We don't have that either. We only have what's written on the board.\"...Read your own frickn board. I'm only following what you put out to me. Anyway, she then proceeds to yell across the bar to some guy \"Yo, why the hell are there things on the board we dont have?\" ...it was just abrupt and awkward/could have been handled a lot better.We finally order our beers and they aren't bad. A guy plops down to me, orders a stout/porter (didn't pay attention, just saw her pour) and finally can't take it and says to her, \"Can I just teach out a better way to pour?\"...And then, all of the sudden her attitude toward us changed!I don't know if it was embarrassment or what - she started introducing the brewery, etc....only like an hour too late.We had 3 rounds and left. I will say that while their beers generally were mediocre (they aren't \"terrible\" like some here have said), their INFUSED beers are actually quite good.Truthfully, I probably won't be back - despite the nice decor, there are a plethora of breweries with better service + brews north of the South Loop.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 9, 10]}, "18": {"description": "Good beers.

As a South Loop resident for a few years, there are a woefully few number of bars in the area, so it was exciting to see that a brand new bar would be opening up, literally across the street from my apartment.The Bureau is a cozy, intimate bar. The decor is retro-modern, with ornate incandescent bulbs, cozy furniture, and non-intrusive background music that really completes a pleasant atmosphere. There are two large TVs mounted in the bar as well.Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, during their first couple of weeks in business, things were a bit rocky. Drink service was a bit slow with only one bartender, coupled with the fact that the venue was completely packed for the first few weeks (the new business rush). However, the timeliness was never a glaring issue, and the staff has been nothing but accommodating, polite, sociable, and competent. I went into the Bureau the first day they opened, and have been regularly returning since, and those 'growing pains' The Bureau experienced their first few weeks should not be held against them. A few months in, it has become my favorite neighborhood bar, not only because of the proximity and convenience, but the neighborhood feel of the establishment, their unique tap selection (Kentucky Bourbon Ale, extremely delicious), and the overall positive experience I have had every time I've been in. The proprietor is a very nice gentleman who constantly makes his rounds through the bar, interacting directly with customers, thanking them for their patronage, and just generally making them feel like their business is valued.If you gave the Bureau a chance after opening and had a bad experience, I would urge you to give them another shot.

And it's very small and cozy, where I would expect people to be sipping something a little more special and more-profitable for the business.Inside, I did find it to be pretty comfy, though we only stayed for a drink. I think the trendy little stools would have made it difficult to stay for too long. The waitress we had was very friendly and attentive, though she mentioned up front that they didn't have a drink list. Very strange if they're going for a lounge feel. One big plus: mixed races and ethnicities, both clientele and staff.

I anxiously anticipated its debut last fall, and I've walked by it countless times because I live down the block. I've peered in the window from before it opened until now. Yet I only went inside for the first time last night.Why? I think it's because I haven't been able to figure it out. At first I thought it was a lounge, and I guess to some degree it is, but they have TVs on the wall that almost always seem to be playing sports.The decor looks lounge-y and they have an excellent beer selection, yet the chalk sign on the street advertises macro beers. (Miller? Bud? Coors? Who remembers--I don't.) Right under the name, \"The Bureau Bar,\" which once again connotes \"lounge\" to me. And it's very small and cozy, where I would expect people to be sipping something a little more special and more-profitable for the business.Inside, I did find it to be pretty comfy, though we only stayed for a drink. I think the trendy little stools would have made it difficult to stay for too long. The waitress we had was very friendly and attentive, though she mentioned up front that they didn't have a drink list. Very strange if they're going for a lounge feel. One big plus: mixed races and ethnicities, both clientele and staff. We need more of that in this otherwise great city, and some places in the South Loop are at least trying.In the end, I guess I thought of The Bureau Bar as being in its adolescence: it's at that awkward phase where it doesn't yet know exactly what it wants to be and is a little uncertain of itself. I plan to go back; but I hope it leans toward what I first expected--more of a lounge, even if they occasionally turn on the sports for a big game.

They wear sweats and look like total bums. Second, they're completely clueless and don't know what the hell they're doing!! They need to go through some extensive training in the tanning salon industry and also sign up for some customer service seminars.

After waiting in line for about 20min (there was another person in front of me) the 2 girls at the front desk finally asked for my info. I gave them my coupon and my ID. They then tried to tell me (with an attitude) that I couldn't use that coupon because it wasn't valid anymore. I pointed out the date and said that I was told at the location I signed up that I could tan until \"today.\" Then they both talked in confusion and seemed really stressed out because a longer line kept forming. I think maybe they were both new or something. Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the girl put me through the computer and told me what room I would be all set in.My then-bf asked for the new customer special (1-week free tanning) and they told him they didn't have that.

There was no manager there at the time. I was very calm with the girl about it but let them know what happened and politely asked that the owner and manager to be notified and for someone to talk to me.The girls were sweet and apologetic and passed along the message to both the manager and the owner.

We opted for the dining half, promising ourselves that we'd get several drinks regardless.The food & drink here are both ridiculously good. I'd never really experienced that whole 'explosion of flavor' thing people talk about, but I definitely found it here. Everything that they cooked for us was fuckin' ridiculously delicious. The food was so good that I didn't even care what the price tag was going to be, i just wanted to taste all of it. I can't remember all of what I ate, because of all the drinks that we had last night. I remember eating a really juicy skirt steak with onions at some point, at another point I had this delicious salmon, some time before that I had this dish which was like artichokes and other vegetables in this creamy tomato sauce. The drinks, with the exception of the 1st and the last are a complete mystery. The first one was this cucumber martini, which was just insanely good. Skip ahead like 4 or 5 drinks, I had this delicious horchata martini for desert.I would have gotten desert, but we were both full. So, we paid the bill, and took off down archer avenue.

The two sliders were cooked to our liking, the egg whites weren't elastic, but soft; almost gelatinous. Once you pricked open the egg yolks, they spewed out and complimented the sliders so well. On top of that, you have an assortment of seasonal fresh fruits to finish your plate. At $11.95 a plate, it was well worth it for a good meal that did not send you over the edge.I'm very happy that we stumbled upon TV and would love to come back to try more of their drink specials and tapas on hand.Parking is available via valet ($6) or around the corner next to the daycare.", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 2, 7]}, "18": {"description": "My roommates ordered tapas here before I came home.

This amazingly was my first time here even though I've lived on the South side for years. I walked into a bright, spacious place. The only patio I observed was in front of the place and it has like 2 or 3 tables that were of course, full. Place had an energetic vibe. Music was a bit loud but hey, it's a bar! My server engaged me promptly and my first brew arrived shortly thereafter. I asked about the 3 alarm wings and she said they were so hot that only one patron she knows of finished an order. I've heard that before;) anyway, decided to go for 2 alarm. They came out and they looked like the mini wings you get frozen at a grocery store. They tasted fine and were surprisingly spicy. Their scrawny size of 8 puny wings would prevent me from ordering them again. Main entree was fried cod. It was lite and crispy although it was quite heavily breaded:/ the cabbage coleslaw was good. The fries were large, bland steak fries that were not seasoned in the least. I didn't eat them. The beer & specialty cocktail list were fairly robust. Wine list is minimal. One obvious negative for me was the tiny glass of bourbon I got! I swear if anyone can open a spot on the South side where they know how to pour a drink, it will be a gold mine! My drink came in one of the smallest cocktail glasses I have ever seen! It's was filled to the brim with ice. The Bullet bourbon in the glass looked almost as clear as water?! Of course it tasted ridiculously weak as well. This disappointing drink of course cost me $8:( This practice of crappy drinks seems pervasive in the SLOOP?!The Scout pours a crappy \"micro drink\" as well. The Firehouse & possibly Krolls are the only place down here that I've received a reasonably normal drink. All in all the place was fine. Food was decent for the price. It's a good place to watch sports or drink beer. It's certainly not a wine & cocktail spot IMO. I do prefer this place to Scout for more of a mature vibe. I would tell folks who are in the area to stop by and check it out", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 7, 20]}, "29": {"description": "Just ate dinner here tonight and had a very interesting experience...

Asked to sit at a table that was marked 'Reserved' to have a modicum of privacy from other diners. Normally, I wouldn't ask, but the restaurant had multiple tables and booths open, and this was just a regular two top table, nothing special. The busser, doubling as a hostess was shut down by the waitress, and refused to seat us there, so we were sat in between two other tables not spaced apart at all, and able to hear every intricacy of their conversations.For some reason, whomever was managing that night had our waitress serving a wedding party in the back, and three regular table in the front. Which meant the busser dropped waters off immediately, but then we were not greeted by the waitress until about 10 minutes after being sat. Either the waitress was rude, or overworked, or both, because when we were greeted, it wasn't really warm or inviting, just \"Do you know what you want to drink?\" in a very flippant tone. When I ordered a vodka club soda, she for some flashed me this weird, quasi-dirty look. Uh, alright.Food was ordered. Ordered a burger without a bun, medium rare. Food took quite some time, and was cooked well-done. I didn't send it back as I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for the kitchen to make a new plate.Once we got our check, we realized that our call drinks (Vodka Club Soda, and a Gin and Tonic) were poured with top shelf liquor, which is absolutely bogus. Call-drinks at any bar are poured with well/rail, or at the very least, the waitress should ask for liquor preference. What should have been a 5/6 dollar cocktail, became an 8 dollar cocktail. I'm not going to lose my shit over 2 bucks, but this is also a bullshit move by the waitress to pump up the check amount.Overall, there are better options with better food and better service in the South Loop. I appreciate a good neighborhood dive bar, but this place left a really bad taste in my mouth.Also, that 'Reserved' table?

And so were the wings. And so was the burger patty. Which may have been OK, but at that price point ($3 for a side of fries), I had very different expectations. If you own a restaurant, just don't serve frozen wings. It's no better than what we could have gotten at a skating rink.

It was this spongy, almost cake-like mess that tasted like nothing and had no crunch or good consistency to it at all. The sauce was decent but the artichokes we ordered were diced up and almost non-existent. I don't know what we would have gotten had we ordered one of their \"gourmet\" pizzas.

You don't know what you're missing out on!\" However, when I'm just hanging out and the group says they're hungry, I won't hesitate to throw it out there as a quick option. Other perks: open year round, no delivery charge, multiple locations, and most importantly consistency. I've ordered from 5+ locations and got the same quality pizza every time.

I explained to them that i would rather sit at a station for the nails to be painted (the second time) but they wouldn't have it. The reason they make you do this is so they can get in as MANY people as possible. Furthermore, they do pedicures in 25 minutes. When i asked her to keep scrubbing (she didn't even smooth them out!) she said \"no, that is all i do\". WHAT?!?! A pedicure done in under 45 min (AT LEAST) is not a pedicure. They barely buff the heals and ball of the foot, the massage consisted of her pounding my calf's for a total of 25 seconds and i won't even go into the paint job.

TOO BAD.\" (with their arms crossed and staring at me all dumb... mind you there were 4 of them just sitting there with no clients) When i explained that i asked for them to be done separately and the woman on the phone confirmed it would be done as so, they said \"noo, too bad. you go somewhere else.\" It is POOR business to: a) promise people appointments on the phone and then change them when you arrive b) have someone taking appointments who doesn't care what the client is saying c) have someone taking appointments who DOESN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH.

Unfortunately, this place not only failed to live up to my expectations but was actually downright disappointing. To begin, the woman (whom I assume is the manager) at the entrance was cold and brushed off my husband's question about the Enomatic wine dispenser. My expectations were beginning to lower. Once we were seated, we ordered wine and the caprese salad. My husband ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon, and when it arrived he was shocked by an overwhelmingly astringent taste. Clearly, the wine was corked. Strike 1. My husband, who is a certified sommelier, ask the server to provide another class. The server went to the bar, talked to the bartender, and came back to the table with this to offer: \"Both I and the bartender, who has lots of experience, tasted the wine, and it seems fine to us. Also, the bottle was just opened, so it couldn't have gone bad.\" Now, I am certainly no expert on wine, but I know 1) wine can go bad before being opened, and 2) the Cab that was served was definitely corked. Regardless, we didn't come to a restaurant to argue over a glass of wine, so my husband just ordered another. However, we were shocked to see the first glass on our check at the end of the night. Strike 2. After about 10 minutes of waiting for the salad, our server informed us that the kitchen was out of tomatoes, so they could not serve the caprese. We said that was fine, and just to send out some mozzarella and meat. Another 10 minutes passed, and someone from the kitchen personally came to our table and informed us that he was not comfortable serving the mozzarella, as he suspected it, too, had gone bad. I understand that their focus is more on spirits, wine, and beer, but don't put food on the menu if you can't deliver. \u00a0That said, I did appreciate his informing us that the food wasn't up to standard, but I just wish I had known 20 minutes before. Instead, we ordered the meat plate and a side of olives.After another 15 minutes, the meat plate arrived, but our server had apparently forgotten about the olives. Again, not a huge deal, but compounding that with everything else makes me doubt the professionalism and preparedness of this restaurant. Strike 3.

The staff were unattentive towards me compared to the other customers (there were only 2 other parties present, with two maximum at a table), and questioned and tried to elaborate on what I ordered, thinking that I absolutely had no clue of what I was getting into.My visit today however, was a completely different story. When I came in, I felt like I wasn't exactly welcome -- there was a large delivery order in place. I feel that I was fairly patient with this incident, however; the staff this time seemed to be very aloof towards me, who presumably was the only other customer in the room at that time. The waitress I got this time kind of gave me the same treatment as I got my second time here, but with less skepticism but more snark. As other customers trickled in during the half hour that I had my dinner, I see the staff being more attentive and friendly to them rather than me, which at the same time is somewhat understandable, yet questionable when it comes to customer priority ethics. To be honest, the only thing consistent with the place is the amount of fruit flies within the establishment.Not to mention, I came home with a really upset stomach, and to spare you the gruesome details... yeah you know what. strange since all of the 'raw' items I've ordered were all blow-torched to the point where it shouldn't be.

I went once, was a bit scarred but wanted to use the other part of my groupon. The first time I went, the girl who did my service (pedicure and no chip mani) worked me over like it was her first time. It was embarrassing for her and for me. She treated my feet like they were made of porcelain. I'm a server, on my feet for 8 hours a day, my feet need a rough, yet efficient hand. They are beat up, and she barely you touched them. My manicure was shoddy and messy, chipped 2 days out. The salon was cold and empty. It was awkward all around.The next time I dreaded my appointment. I get there and the salon is dark and no one is there. I was the first appointment of the day and I had to wait 30 minutes is drizzly cold weather to get in. I was peeved and wet. I had the same technician. This time she was, well not great, but more experienced. Much better results. She is uncomfortably silent though. All attempts at conversation were clipped and painfully awkward. Again, I was the only one is the salon. It's a miracle they can afford to stay open when I'm sure I'm always the only one there.

Especially since its black owned and I want to support the efforts of the underdog in the business world. With that said, let's start at the beginning. From what I can see, the downfall of this place is the customer service. Management needs to make sure that the people working there have some aspect of what true costumer service means. The people who should be picking up the phone are NOT picking up the phone and when they do - they aren't 'smiling' while they speak. Someone has said once to me, call back in an hour or 'hold on' and I was put on hold for 12 minutes before I hung up and tried again, with no answer! Today the woman at the front desk let the phone go to voicemail 3 times while I was standing there waiting for my appointment - was she busy you ask? NO, she was shopping for shoes online! The phone should NEVER go unanswered, that's clients/business calling on the other end! With 5 employees present, the phone should never go unanswered! Well today, I get there on time for my appointment and I'm made to wait while I can clearly see my technician talking to another tech in the hallway. Another thing, which just happened right now as I am typing this, the tech should not be picking up their cell phone while filing my toe nails or what happened during my pedi last time, the tech walking away to pick up the phone while in mid filing. Or the way they dress: sweats, T-shirts and flip flops sometimes dirty - they should dress according to the type of clientele they want to attract. With all the walkaways from my technicians (both times) my Mani/pedi has taken over 2 hours. It should under NO circumstances take that long! Here I am again waiting for my technician to return. The shitty thing is that I've met the owner and she seems really awesome and customer service minded. I don't understand why she doesn't demand the same from her staff. There should be rules, no phones while with a client, no visitors while with a client (yes my tech just had someone visit and stepped away for a moment), no letting the phone go unanswered, no walking away from clients, treat clients well, talk to clients (its been about 25 minutes and my tech still hasn't given me a name! One more thing: you need to demand that your staff clean the salon thoroughly and the stained towels should be thrown away - that's just nasty - use paper towels when painting nails so the towels don't get stained. I shouldn't have to ask for a clean towel every time I'm here! ...which unfortunately, today will be the last time I'm here.

I've had plenty of manicures and pedicures in my life and this ranks as the absolute worst. I can't speak for the other staff but my nail technician -and I'm being kind even referring to her as a \"tech\" because she was the most overconfident, unskilled person I've ever dealt with- was the worst. She was lazy and lacked any nail care skills while surprisingly boasting that \"she was good at what she did.\" Here is how good she was: She clipped my nails haphazardly. She lacked any deft of hand in clipping my cuticles, leaving them in pain and now they're peeling back. She used an old, weathered nail file that couldn't file my nails. She didn't clean off the nail file dust from my fingers before painting my nails. At no point did she use polish remover to clean my nails. And to top it off, she lazily painted my nails, constantly leaving color on the edges. I immediately removed the polish and repainted my hands when I got home given the terrible paint job. While taking care of me, she also complained about having another client following me and said she would call to see if they could reschedule. I was so turned off by her and the service that I opted to have a regular polish instead of the no-chip manicure I paid for with my Groupon. I thought perhaps she was just a lump of coal in a diamond mine but the place itself was also disappointing. The location was dirty, the nail polish selections were minimal and almost all the polishes were clogged and thick. I hesitated getting into the pedicure tub as the one next to me looked like it had never been cleaned. In short, I will NEVER step hand or foot into this place again, not even if they paid me.

I should've written 2 separate yelp reviews, as both of my experiences were vastly different for the same service and with the same tech. I purchased a Lifebooker (another type of groupon-like site) for 2 no-chip manicures. First off, this place is impossible to book an appt. I literally called for weeks and was never able to get someone on the phone. I thought the place had closed down for a second because I couldn't comprehend how a nail/hair/salon could not answer the phone during regular business hours. Anyway, after weeks of trying, I finally got someone on the phone. They then told me it was going to be about 3 weeks to get an appointment for a no-chip mani. Extremely upset, I scheduled the appt anyway. I wanted to just get my money's worth and move on. I had a family emergency (a big one) and wasn't able to make it to my appt. I called the day before and they said I wouldn't be able to get another appt for another few weeks. I decided to call back at a later time as I was too stressed to deal with this A month later, I call and they answer on the first try. Remarkable. I made an appt on a Saturday morning. I get there and easily score a parking spot right outside. I walk to the salon and have to punch a code on a metal box for someone to buzz me and open the door. Is tight security really needed for a salon? Anywho, I walk in, mention I have an appt and was told to wait. They started looking for the person to perform the mani and couldn't find them. Then they realize they didn't come in today. This would've been nice to know beforehand, especially since they had my contact info on file. I was then instructed to sit with another individual that could perform the task. I was shown the wall of no-chip polish and liked they had Opi, Sheliac and Gellish varieties.I then sit down with a really young (she probably just graduated out of high school) girl and started taking off my nail polish. I immediately notice there is no water to soak my hands in. Nails 101: You never cut a cuticle or polish/buff a nail before soaking, as you have to soften the skin and wash the gunk off. This was not done here. She quickly went through the cuticle-cutting and buffing and did not cut the nail as short as I described. A lot of cuticle and rough, dead skin (that annoying, corner skin) was also not adequately or thoroughly removed. She then proceeds to paint my nails. Again, no hand-washing or water soaking after all this dust and debris was on my hands. As it was really early in the morning and I was exhausted, I didn't pay close enough attention to the nail tech. She started on a THIRD coat of polish. If you know about no-chip, you know in essence, there's 4 coats: 1 base, 2 color and 1 top. This already makes the nail look a little thicker than regular polish if not done correctly. With globs of polish and an unnecessary coat, it looked like I had little helmets on my hands. Seriously, someone thought I had fake nails, even though they're real. The coating was ridiculously thick. This is a massive pet peeve of mine and I brought it up immediately. The nail tech argued that the color was very light and needed an extra coat for it to be visible. I let it go. Once it was done, I was extremely upset and really never wanted to step foot in here again.After about a week or 2, the polish was all messed up. This is unusual for no-chip as I have easily gone a month without having to touch-up my nails. About a month later, I realized I was out of money but needed a mani badly. I took my chances and went back to Marimarshe' for the 2nd no-chip purchased. This was a MUCH better experience. The same nail tech assisted me and remembered me. She said she hopes my nails were ok the last time and has \"been practicing really hard to get better.\" This broke my heart. I must've been such a bitch to this poor girl, I can only imagine how hard she was working on her craft after that day. The mani this time did include a hand washing after buffing but again, no water before. This is still very strange to me. I picked a cool white polish and she did a free design on my ring finger for free. She did improve in the sense of placing the perfect amount of polish on the nail but I still had bubbles in one nail, a hair stuck in another, and after a week, chips again. I see this as not the tech's fault. She probably just started and needs more practice. I see this as the salon's fault for placing inexperienced staff to do services on the busiest salon days. I really liked the girl that helped me. She was genuinely sweet and I'm sure she tried her hardest to do a good job. I just feel that this salon should know better than not to have water for any mani and to put staff that still require training wheels.

We finally got the chance to try them out two weeks ago to celebrate our parents anniversary. Our reservation was for 6:30pm on a Saturday and we had been a little worried that parking might be a problem. But, we got lucky and found a spot in the parking lot out back. Others from our group found parking on the street. It also looks like they have valet parking for those who do not want to search for a spot on their own.We walked in through the entrance from the back of the restaurant. We saw a couple of waiters who just glanced at us, but none attempted to direct us to where the hostess was. After looking around the crowded place for a bit, we finally figured out where the front desk was located. We had reservations, so we didn't have to wait long to get seated. The ambiance was lively and pretty upbeat with constant chatter....what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. It would be a bit noisy for intimate conversation, but our family was fine with it and the kids loved that they did not have to whisper through dinner. We had the zucchini/calamari combo as well as the steamed mussels for appetizers. All of us loved the fried combo...crunchy, light and seasoned just right. We would have ordered another one if we weren't afraid that we wouldn't finish our entrees later on! The mussels were only ok though. The meat was not tender and didn't taste all that fresh. The wine sauce that it came with was just ok. A bit on the salty side. Definitely could not compare to the mussels from Cafe Iberico.After a wait (they were pretty busy that evening), our food finally came out. My Gnocchi Romano was delicious! The gnocchi was soft with just the right amount of chew and the sauce was not overly thick and seasoned very well. I could have done without the peas, but the mushrooms were really good and the \u00a0spicy sausage gave the dish a kick. My kids shared a spaghetti and meatball dish which they both said was yummy. My youngest normally isn't the biggest fan of marinara sauces, but he actually asked for a second helping! Others in the group also seemed to really enjoy the food. I had a bite of my mom's veal marsala and it was tasty and tender! The only gripe was that it may have come with a bit too much sauce. I also had a bite of the linguini with shrimp and broccoli and let me tell ya, the shrimps were pretty big! The linguini could have used a slightly bit more salt & pepper, but in all it was a nice light dish. My sister's chicken parmigiana and my bro-in-law's Linguine Vongole (baby clams) both got thumbs up. You should have seen the amount of baby clams in the Vongole dish. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and tender. The salads we ordered (the baby arugula and one other which I forgot) were pretty huge! four people can probably share one as a side. We had brought in our own cake, so ended up not trying any of their desserts. All in all, a great place for a decent Italian meal down near the south loop area. Plate sizes are decent, service was also decent tho I think it would've been nice to see more jovial/friendly wait staff. They all looked a bit on the sad side and some were a bit huffy. The owner/manager did come by our table to check and see how we were doing and said a few words to us which was nice. I would definitely go back and would recommend others to at least try the place.

Maybe the non-Italian dishes or something fancier would have been better but, hey is it unreasonable for me to expect them to nail the basics? At the prices on their menu (no entree under $15 and very few under $20) I certainly expect a lot better than what I had. The stuffed shells ($19) doesn't even make sense. It is essentially a huge plate of cheese. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cheese, but this was just crazy....Jumbo shells filled way too much with boring, barely seasoned ricotta, then covered in a vodka cream sauce (yay... more cheese...) and topped with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella (because cheese). There was absolutely no presentation of the food either. It was served on an oblong, roughed up off-white plate and just looked like an angry lunch lady ladled it on. It was sooooo monotonous and a huge chore to eat. I ate half just for something to do and the other half was wrapped up and the multiple attempts that have been made to eat it at home (because $$$) have been mostly unsuccessful. It wasn't a good dish served poorly, it was a bad dish. I always thought Gordon Ramsay was being crazy picky about stuff on his myriad shows but I get it now. Chefs sometimes have terrible ideas. This was one of them. My recommendation to Cafe Bionda on this dish... 1) spinach in the ricotta or at least some (more?) fresh herbs. 2) a very fresh, simple marinara would have made this a LOT better. vodka sauce is not the answer. 3) don't stuff the shells that much. do a google image search of stuffed shells. no one is stuffing them that much. and bland stuffing is the last thing anyone wants more of!(an afterthought... I also had the tiramisu... it was also very bland.

She delivered your drinks! What do you need her for?\" WHAT? Seriously, WHAT? I need her so we can ORDER! I just responded, \"It has been 45 minutes. We would like to order.\" It was then that we realized that the woman who brought over our drinks, the bartender, was ALSO the waitress for the 6-9 tables in the room AND the entire bar!

When we finished eating, the waitress/bartender came over and asked if we were finished, we all said yes. She walked away and 25 minutes later we asked her for the check.

SALON!!!! \u00a0First about my stylist:Cori is a true master of her craft and the only one I trust with my follicles. \u00a0I love the fact that she is an artist and uses your hair as her canvas to create works of beauty that even Matisse and Monet would admire. \u00a0I give her absolutely no instruction. \u00a0I simply sit in her chair and allow her to create. \u00a0Each and every time the results are absolutely amazing and render compliments from the time I leave her chair until I return for my next appointment, usually months later. \u00a0Specific things that make her one of the most talented people in a smock:1. Cori is EXTREMELY punctual and attentive. \u00a0In the 7 years that she has been my stylist, she has NEVER stacked a client on top of my appointments which can last anywhere from 2.5-5 hours depending on my color needs.2. She has an amazing gift with color. \u00a0She once told me that she dreams in hair color and it totally shows. \u00a0The way she combines base/natural colors with highlights is completely unmatched in this city. \u00a0My hair is a kaliedescope of colors that compliment one another and my complexion. \u00a0She also takes the time color your brows to match your hair. \u00a0My favorite color job from her occurred in October 2012 where she colored my hair to look like the colors of the trees as the leaves began to fall. \u00a0My head was full of vibrant brown, red, and gold tones that slowly faded (as color does) \u00a0to honey/amber tones as winter set in. \u00a0It was simply gorgeous.3. She is the ONLY stylist I have met in my entire life who can cut my natural hair PERFECTLY without having blow dry/flat iron it first. \u00a0She had me at \"hello\" with this one.Now the salon itself:This is, by far, my most favorite salon where Cori has worked. \u00a0Justin has an amazing and warm personality, that invites you into this family-oriented space. \u00a0You're greeted at the door by a smiling and hospitable woman, I do believe her name is Verna, who immediately sets the stage for the service to come. \u00a0Justin, too, is a master of his craft. \u00a0I've only seen him create sew-in weave extensions and perform sew-in maintenance, but that man is working pure unadulterated magic with that hair! \u00a0A few things I love about the space include:1. Intimate feel - It is a smaller, loft-style space that is extremely well planned and used. \u00a0The flow from the chair, to the bowl, to the dryer, back to the chair can happen without roadblocks and twists and turns.2. Location - It is centrally located in the South Loop and easily accessible from a number of main thoroughfares and expressways. \u00a0Traffic is forever free-flowing and metered parking is ALWAYS available.3. Decor - The decor is simple with clean lines and warm, inviting colors. \u00a0Browns and blues with silver accents and photos of the amazing Chicago Skyline make for a relaxing trip to the salon.4. Sanitation - I don't think I've ever walked in and seen a piece of hair sitting on the floor. \u00a0Even when I get my hair trimmed, by the time I remove my smock and grab my coat to leave, my hair magically disappears from the floor. \u00a0Each stylist's station is well organized and aesthetically pleasing. \u00a0The bathroom is also impeccable.If you are looking for a salon and stylist who truly takes your hair seriously and has your follicles' best interests in mind, THIS.

Self-service checkouts removed: \u00a0One of the previous highlights was the ability with self-checkout to zip in and out of the store when coming come from work and needing just a few things. Granted, there were the occasional novice shoppers who jammed up the lines, but for the most part you could be in and out with minimal fuss. Today, those self-checkout lanes are removed and replaced with shortened express lanes with inattentive cashiers. I am all for giving folks cashier jobs (my single mother supported us with her grocery clerk job), but rarely are all of these lanes open and when they are, they are staffed with employees who clearly don't want to be there. Further, there is scarcely enough counter room to place your handbasket to empty it and then you don't know where to put it afterward. \u00a0And of course having the cashier take it for you would be too courteous. It's just a logistical hassle and makes me avoid shopping there for quick trips. Erratic pricing: \u00a0It used to be you could assume Jewel had the cheapest prices in the neighborhood. But now with Target and Mariano's within a few blocks, you have to be very careful and comparison shop. For example, there is a common frozen food item that has an everyday price 60% higher at Jewel than the everyday price at Mariano's. Truly exorbitant for no reason. And trust me, that is just one example. Don't get me started on non-food items.Questionable quality of \"fresh\" items: \u00a0If you like spongy nectarines, kale that wilts in two days and \"fresh baked\" pastries so stale that they actually crunch when you bite into them, head over to this Jewel. \u00a0For me, the straw that broke the camel's back was this morning when I bought a tray of cinnamon rolls with a purchase by date two days from now.

Asked the salesguy for my size and he said they had them but it was going to cost $250 which is $90 over retail. I told him he could keep the pair and left the store.These guys are straight up hypebeasts. $250? Good luck with that! I took the bus over to Footlocker on State. Walked in, asked for my size, walked out with my pair. For $160. The FTL salesperson said the store received 300 pairs. Wowzers! This is how every release should be.

The Not-So-Good:The owner would not honor my Groupon for a spray tan because I had used a Groupon for a wax on a previous visit. *** This was not listed as a limitation on the Groupon. *** Very disappointed. I had to shell out another $41 for my tan on top of my Groupon. Not great customer service.Also, they missed quite a few spots on my wax. I had to go to another spa to get cleaned up. I recommend going to Cleise, Trim, Exhale or Bliss for waxing.I don't think I will be back - Ortanic is better and honors the deals they give us clients, and the waxing is better at many places around this great city.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 2, 1]}, "32": {"description": "Victoria is awesome.

I was disappointed but I still ordered it. It was good but nothing to write home about. The eggs were tasty and the breakfast potatoes were deliciously seasoned. My first visit was slightly disappointing but overall tasty. My second visit was match with even more disappointment. I went the morning of Valentine's Day with my girlfriend. I ordered the corn beef hash and pancakes. The pancakes were decent but the problem came from the corn beef hash. IT WAS CLEARLY FROM A CAN! It definitely was canned corn beef hash which is deeply disappointing since I love fresh made corn beef hash. They didn't even bother to crisp up the hash. So incredibly disappointing!The last visit occurred last Tuesday, so late June. I tried to go back to the chicken and waffles and still received chicken tenders instead of actual chicken legs. I also ordered potatoes that were unbelievably bland. The first time I had the potatoes they didn't need any sort of salt or hot sauce but this time I couldn't add enough salt or hot sauce. Those potatoes were absolutely flavorless. My girlfriend ordered a ham and cheese omelet with added spinach and it was greasy. Yup, she had a greasy omelet. It also had an overwhelming taste of artificial butter. We will no longer visit this restaurant again due to its immense inconsistencies in its menu and way of cooking the food. Decent food but don't expect to get exactly what the menu says. One day it'll be delicious and the next it will taste like cardboard.The service is also very nice just to add but overall terribly inconsistent restaurant!", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 6, 29]}, "48": {"description": "In short, the food was pretty bad.

I was very nervous going in as I have had the same hairdresser for years and was very nervous about entrusting \u00a0my hair into somebody else's hands. Megan looked at my hair, asked a few questions and I felt she knew what she was doing and it made me feel better. She assured me she is very good and I won't have orange hair or anything like that. She also said she does very thin highlights so that they look very natural. Perfect I thought! She washed my hair and walked me back to the chair. After I looked at myself in the mirror I got goose bumps - my roots did look too \"warm\" or simply orange. I started calming myself that once she dries my fair, it's going to look better. I was patiently waiting, preying inside that I will look good. For a moment I made myself think my hair looks good, I need to be open minded and need to stop comparing everything to what my previous hair stylist used to do. I walked out of Spa Heaven feeling all right, but as soon as I came home, my boyfriend said \"you look...... nice\". And I know it meant \"not so nice\". I stared at myself in the mirror and almost started crying. My roots were too golden, instead of having blond highlights, I couldn't distinguish the highlights and the streaks of my natural brown hair. I never thought that highlights can be so thin that they look like single a color! Everyone I saw that day thought I had my hair colored, \u00a0not highlighted. I was so upset about the color that I completely forgot the fact that she also gave me a haircut. I always had the most beautiful layers and all I wanted was to have 1-2 inches taken off. \u00a0When I was blow drying my hair the next day I noticed that the hair cut looked awful! \u00a0Looked like she chopped 1 inch off and didn't do layers at all! I just want to cry. 4 hours of my life and almost $200 wasted. I can't wait to go to a professional stylist in a couple of months, probably male, and have my hair fixed, even if it will cost me a fortune. There is no price tag on feeling fabulous.

Very convenience location from the red line transportation.Having got my eye lashes done before I was sort of dreading laying there for an hour, but she played such good music I was almost able to fall asleep. I like that she did one eye at a time versus having both eyes taped and going back and forth between lash applications. Somehow that made a big difference in my comfort. (I'm a contact wearer) I love the results! Not too long that they look fake, but they do make a huge difference. I have very large eyes and you have to use a longer length in order to make them really stand out.As a side note something I will probably need to take up with Groupon, but she said that the deal where you get one full set of mink lashes and a follow up 4 week appointment is not correct. The follow up appointment is more so a filler appointment, but after four weeks you'll probably only have two lashes left and require a new set (which she is willing to charge a discount on).

Ok in march a purchased some hair from the salon which I communicated with Tony, the owner of the hair line. He refers to the hair as lavish hair smh. At that time I purchased what I believe to have been 4 bundles of Brazilian deep wave, 22inches. I paid $400 at that wish they made seem was a discounted price. I didn't mind at the time because I figure good quality hair is a lil more expensive. I've been wearing sewins since 2006. So I know about good quality. All my previous experiences with hair had been great. My sisters a stylist so she's always made sure I had the best hair which a the minimum lasted atleast 2yrs. I heard about salon heavens hair through social media so I decided to give it a try. So I co washed the hair mildly and had my sister install it. It was ok.

So instead of leavin my hair out I purchased a closure which was $125. I called bac this week to set a appt only to find out that stylist was no longer with the salon. I did my research and found him. A couple of days ago I wnt to him for a shampoo and style with the same Install he did jus 3wks ago. As soon water and a small amount of shampoo hit the hair it immediately started to tangle. It gotten so bad he set me under the steamer before the second wash. We tried so hard to untangle but the more we brushed and comb it startin shedding etc. We untangle the one side and it was about 2 bundles of hair that came out. We came to the conclusion this was not Virgin hair at all. It was synthetic blend which seems to be happening more and more these days. I immediately went to the salon heaven and let tony know happened after only two months of purchasing this hair. I just wanted to compromise tell him that the hair was professionally washed he jus so me bad hair and I wanted my money back. He was a complete jerk and did everything but admit his wrong. This was suppose to be a good investment for me. Instead it was a nightmare. He offered me $50 off my nxt hair purchase. Like who in they right mind would buy some more hair after experiencing that?? He is a fraud. I'm a young hard educated mother of two. I make sure I spend my money wisely. Because if this night mare I had to purchase more hair from a good reliable vendor.

(You can get a preview of the view from the 'Sky Eye', Adler's webcam.) There are a number of free telescopes inside, along the windows facing the city... people really enjoy checking out the skyline through them.Galileo's is run by Food for Thought catering, which operates about thirty venues throughout the city.

It's always much busier then. It can also get kind of crowded when shows from the two theaters let out, especially right around noon.

This was not the case at DMK Burger Bar. I was at Soldier Field for the Ravens-Bears game that got delayed for over 2 hours while we waited for tornado winds to clear Chicago. My buddy and I evacuated our seats in Section 126 and DMK was the first concession we saw. We knew we'd have a lot of time to kill so we went and stood in line. The line moved pretty quickly and the menu looked surprisingly good. We each ordered a burger, which came with fries, which I was not expecting. Even if you go to places like Smashburger or ZinBurger, fries don't come with the burgers. Burgers at those places are anywhere from $6-13 and fries are $3-4 separately. So when I saw that the burgers at DMK were going for $13 WITH fries AT a professional football stadium, I was thrilled, but still not expecting much from the quality. We picked up our order maybe 10 minutes after placing it and we were lucky. We were just about the last customers in line before the stadium concessions were forced to close due to the heavy rain and wind... This made for 60,000+ pissed off football fans who weren't able to overpay for food and beer even if they wanted to, while getting wet on the concourse without any indication as to when the game would recommence. Oh, and the Bears were down 10-0.When I tell you the burger and fries I had for $13 at a football stadium were among the best I've ever had in my life, I'm not kidding.

The restaurant was 10% full when the two of us arrived for our first time. January, on a Sunday 2016 at about noon. We were interested in trying a new brunch restaurant since we go out for brunch weekly and most of my friends get together for brunch often. Unfortunately, this place was not a good idea. The hostess had an attitude because we didn't have reservation for this empty brunch spot. We have never been before but I think it's odd to have been asked for a reservation and responded to negatively for not having one as there are many brunch restaurants in Chicagoland that are constantly busy and do not take reservations. This was a mostly empty spot on the south side. The outside looks like an abandoned commercial space complete with bars on the door and a pad lock. It is cafeteria style seating so any reservation is not going to have your party sitting at your own table. Speaking of which, the table was wobbly and the sofa chairs were white and some point but are now a dirty grey. The lighting is also very dim for a brunch restaurant. We were seated and told our server would be with us. We were then brought drinking glasses that were completely wet. It was about 15 min later (still no server), and my man asked the hostess about the food that was sitting out in trays on a table. We had no idea if we were to just go fix our own plate or if our orders were to be taken as there were no menus given to us. The hostess simply said \"it's a buffet brunch\" and walked off. Zero customer service and no update on our server. Another party then came in and was seated next to us. A server immediately came to them and provided service.At this time we decided to leave and felt it was best that we continue to spend our money else where. I don't recommend this place at all.", "rating": "1", "date": [2016, 1, 18]}, "9": {"description": "Some of my girlfriends and I went here in November. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this place. \u00a0The food... was DELICIOUS!

That's a long list if you ask me. There might have even been more food that I'm missing. Ohhh, yeah, mac & cheese too.

Alas, my experience didn't match up to those loves. I've been to Fleetwood on two prior occasions for non-dinning events. As a South Loop-er, woke up the morning and said \"why not\", time for me to give this black owned venue a try in terms of dinning. I purchased the groupon but since reservations have to be made 48 hrs in advance, I decided to go ahead with my girlfriend sin the groupon. We figured we could use the groupon on another occasion. Strike One, the hostess originally tried to sit us at the front of the restaurant at the unclothed high tables \u00a0immediately by the door instead of the nicer low tables that populate the majority of the restaurant. The nicer tables were empty but were apparently reserved for reservations. After asking kindly to move, we were able to. Seating in the front felt like second class seating. Not nearly as nice. Strike two, there is no printed menu. We had to prompt the waitress to explain the offerings. At no point was pricing for the Buffett even given. We informed the waitress that we did not want the bottomless mimosa option.The food was decent. The shrimp and grits were the best thing on the serving table. The waffles were excellent, though it's hard to mess that up. Omelletes, had to tell buddy to cook it a little bit longer--no biggie. The food, overall, was solid. Nothing less and certainly not more. Strike three, When we received the check, we noticed we were charged for a mimosa per person. Apparently, the non-bottomless mimosa buffet choice comes with one \"free\" mimosa. The waitress never explained it. We brought this to her attention, she apologized, and brought mimosas to the table. Strike four, the mimosa was 90% OJ. Even the table next to us scoffed at the taste. Strike five, they do not have coffee. At the end of the experience, I promptly cancelled my groupon. It certainly isn't worth the full price offering, let alone the groupon. As a S.

Called, left several messages - nothing. Called, texted \"owner\", nothing.

I had some drama over the dye process about my extensions I brought into the shop, nevertheless I got them installed anyway by personal choice. That wasn't the best idea.I went back the next following week to get my hair issue resolved in hopes of getting it redone with their hairline in which they sell. \u00a0Sha who was my stylist was very apologetic about the service as well as my dissatisfaction about the overall outcome. She was helpful in trying to assist the issue to the best of her ability. She informed me that she wouldn't be able to do my hair until the next following week which is understandable. So I agreed to purchase the same hair in which I saw the owner as well as staff wear. It was a Italian brand weave. I was informed they only had a loose Italian wave pattern of this particular hair. So I agreed. I bought 2 bundles. I know how to sew hair in myself so I installed. I went to get my hair done professionally just to treat myself seeing I got my hair colored and cut earlier why not do it up all the way. Anyways after installing it I noticed it was wavy even after I flat ironed a section the tips where wispy looking very thin. So I decided to wash my hair, I use excellent shampoo and conditioner \" Joico.\" I let it air dry because even before I washed it it looked wet. As if somebody slapped Vaseline in my hair. The washing didn't work. It looks jet black and slippery, not realistic as the employees hair. I know weave I've been wearing it since forever. It's always about the quality. This hair appears to be some wet and wavy bull mess. It holds no curl. It looks greasy even though I didn't add any oil to my hair when installing or after. All I can say is I wasted so much money. Maybe you will get the correct hair if you work with them.

I guess it's one name, but whatevs. Let me state that I am giving her 5*, but the salon as a whole 4. So here's how things went...I was in a state of disarray. I got my fist ever sew-in today done by another lady. The sew-in job itself was amazing, but the lady doesn't do styling and her business partner that does styling wasn't in the shop today. I left this afternoon feeling a little unsure that this sew-in was a good idea. I felt deflated. I had looked up places on Yelp last night that offered affordable cuts and style in preparation for having to get my hair done since I knew in advance that my hair wouldn't be cut/styled at the first place. That's when I saw this place. Their website says that on Sundays they are by appt. only. Sad, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to get in.... Well, I called post sew-in, they said, \"Come on in.\" SUPER!That's when I met Shantell... Nice, sweet, YOUNG lady. I had no idea what to expect, but there was no way I could leave looking worse than how I looked walking in. I had nothing to lose, and the price was right. Shantell did my hair whilst we chatted and she gave me some pointers on hair care and products. She started by first straightening my hair. I was already impressed. Then she cut. THEN, she made magic happen. She curled my hair in to lovely ringlets using her flat-iron. I loved it. She even showed me how she does the maneuver so I can try to copy it at home. Fast-forward til the end.. I am so happy I got the sew-in once Shantell brought out it's greatest potential. So, in conclusion, the shops' alright. They're remodeling, but it's got potential. I like that it's intimate and it could have that 'beauty shop' feel where women go to get beautified while sharing gossip. ;) And Shantell (have I posted her name enough) was my saviour today.

The final product is why I used to like it so much. I have been three times before this incident occurred. I went to the shop, loved my hair, and went on my merry way like any other time.Three days after my appointment, I had noticed that my all white over-the-ear headphones were turning a blackish-blue color on the ear cushions. I assumed I was being careless and not taking care of them well enough and shrugged it off. Not thinking that the hair that was provided by the Remy Hair Shop could be what was destroying my $200 headphones. Two days later, I noticed a black rings on my white scarf. I knew it had to have been my hair. I called the shop and the receptionist believed that since it had been almost a week, it wasn't their problem. Even though they provided the hair and I spent $250 on my appointment. I told her that the dye had leaked onto my belongings and that still had not caused a different reaction. They did not offer to correct the problem only \"I mean, you can try washing it.\" was all she kept interjecting. Frustrated I asked to speak to a manager and come to find out she was the manager. I told her that it was their responsibility to correct the problem. They sold me a defective product, and they should try to rectify the problem. \u00a0At least wash the hair for me to give me some kind of peace of mind. Alas, this did not happen. I wasn't even asking for compensation for my damaged belongings, but for them to wash the defective hair. Moral of the story, DON'T GO HERE. The receptionist doesn't care.

When he went to remove the polish he looked at me and said \"wait this is OPI, why didnt you tell me\" ummm im sorry I didn't realize I had to. I hate places that do not soak your hands before cutting the cuticle. Basically you are getting your cuticles cut with just some soap and all this acetone on your hands. The next thing he says is \"who did your nails before. The cuticles are cut poorly and the shape is not good\" Oh sorry about that yet again. I will make sure to tell the last tech what a horrible job they did buddy. The last straw for me was as my nails were drying I lifted my hand to cover my mouth while sneezing and he scolds me for moving saying If I mess it up he has to do it all over again so do not move.

Around 11, the place seemed to fill up more, so it might be wise to book an appointment on a Saturday afternoon at least. The pedicure received here was okay. I got the impression that my nail technician was a beginner due to the lack of time she spent scrubbing my feet, and messing up one of toes (she re did it thankfully). She also didn't apply lotion, which was unusual to me. When my feet were drying, the host asked how my pedicure went? I told her it went fine, but I needed some lotion. She gave me some, and I applied it to my dry feet. I am totally ok with paying $35 (normal price) for a pedicure, but this pedicure was missing some essential elements of an amazing pedicure.

One of my pet peeves for nail salons is that they sometimes use cheap products on customers. Even though with the nail polish you can't see the damage, it always shows after you remove the coloring. But here at Spa O I don't have to worry about their products. Last time I was there, I recognized most of the products they used on me, and the standard mani-pedi included a vitamin E capsule. My nail lady cut it open and the oil inside flew right onto my hands, then she gave me a short hand massage. That felt really good! I wish she could keep massaging my arms and hands.The only reason why I didn't give it a five star is because of the noise. It's understandable that they're very popular and it's hard to keep the salon quiet with all the customers coming in and out. Also, they have a sign on the wall that customers should tip their nail ladies in cash. I don't usually carry a lot of cash on me, so every time I come here I have to make a trip to an ATM first.

I hate places that do not soak your hands before cutting the cuticle. Basically you are getting your cuticles cut with just some soap and all this acetone on your hands. The next thing he says is \"who did your nails before. The cuticles are cut poorly and the shape is not good\" Oh sorry about that yet again. I will make sure to tell the last tech what a horrible job they did buddy.

My days start early and end late. I needed a nail salon that was close to the condo and offered flexible business hours. Spa O was my first stop. On my first visit, my nail technician was pretty crabby and wasn't very attentive. I was convinced after that appointment that I wouldn't go back. However, I had one hour available on a Sunday and Spa O was the only nail salon in the area that had an opening for a no-chip manicure. I was reluctant, but it was my only chance to have my nails done that weekend. It was a completely different experience! Clearly, I just caught the first nail tech on a bad day. I have truly come to love Spa O! Their location, flexible hours, rewards program, shoulder massages and attentiveness are the reasons I continue to give them business.

You earn 10% for each dollar spent and once you spend $150, you would have racked up $15 that you can use towards services. For better or worse, since everything is so darn expensive it's pretty easy to spend $150 after a few visits.- Well, well, well... I just noticed on their website that they have official guarantees on service: \"We guarantee 2 weeks for No-Chip, 1 week for weekly polish. We free to fix chipped nail within guaranteed period.\"Cons:- It's too darn expensive - $45 mani/pedi, $45 no-chip mani- Their promotions are not consistent.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it serves delicious, mouth-watering Mexican food. And just like everything Mexican, the place is irresistible and unforgettable. I came here on a weekday, after a long day at work, with a friend after she highly recommended it. The setting is charmingly dark, cozy and the tables are wonderfully situated to fit groups of 2 or 4. But what is fascinating about this place is that it merges the best of both worlds -- while it has a distinct Mexican feeling, the music and the drinks selection are decisively Caribbean. Picture this: trying to decide which Mojito to drink, while Celia Cruz or Hector Lavoe are playing on the background, while the rest of the menu is peppered with your favorite Mexican dishes. We ended up having the Mango and Raspberry mojitos. They were nothing short of \u00a0spectacular. As for food, there was no way I was not going to have the Grilled Arachera. It was soft, tender, beautifully prepared and accompanied by a nice selection of rice, beans, pico de gallo and even asparagus! The mojitos were so good, we had to have them again. All in all, La Cantina is the type of place you can go to impress your date, take a group of a friends for, or even enjoy it on your own. Terrific place. Highly recommended.

After these 2 years, that's just impossible to have that many bad days..... Also VERY consistent throughout the staff of unfriendliness attitudes! Definitely not a service with a smile place!!!!!!!! Vibe is awesome, coming from the patron's that is!!! Very cool atmosphere, live bands and very good bands at that! Although the staff is in need of some guidance and most definitely some manners, or perhaps guidance on just plain being friendly! Most of them (not all, but most) look and give off such an uneasy and just downright rude attitude towards patrons, it's hard to believe the place stays in business! I'm born and raised in Chicago and we are pretty friendly approachable people, I expect to feel comfortable and happy when coming here.....nope, doesn't happen. Always feel like I've walked into a time warp and I'm in another State.....A State of unfriendliness and full of ass*#%*s! :/!!!!! We were there for drinks a few months ago, sat at the bar with a good friend for a few hours. We literally just wanted to have some drinks, chat, forget about some problems for awhile and laugh.....well humongous damper was brought on by the female bartender! With every single drink order she brought her bitchiness....couldn't believe what was happening!!!! Well, her tip reflected this! She did look cool with her bandanna and all!!!!! LOLBut her attitude sucked!!!!! I'm a huge tipper, definitely at least 20 perc, usually always way more.... I know a lot of server's get treated poorly and it's a shitty job at times, but if someone is greeting and treating you with a smile and respect shouldn't the server react in the same manner?!!!!! Tough job, but each customer is different, these servers should try and remember this. Maybe their tips would reflect with a new change in their NEW attitude! Patrons usually pay a cover at the door for the live bands. Going here to eat and drink and just looking to unwind and have a good time, only to be met with the uppity attitudes of the servers! Just Sucks, any way you slice it! Upstairs bartender, front door guy with long hair and the bus driver are always very nice, informative and welcoming! I wish I knew their names to give them the credit they deserve!!!!!! Place needs more people like this!!!!! Mostly for the past 2 years of living right around the corner from here the experience is always the same....poor and very unfriendly. The staff acts as if they are being put out when you ask for a beer at the bar, or if they have a certain beer etc. Had dinner and beers as recently as last night, took 25 minutes for our waiter and he was so busy he really never came back until we had to flag him down, also had to go to bar for our own water, never got our order of onion rings and 3 of us were sick to our stomachs an hour after eating there! :/ Looks as though the place has now become under staffed, think our waiter was actually a guy that helps set up the stage etc..... Poor thing, looked like he was totally out of his element. So, just because you're a \"COOL rocker type venue\" doesn't excuse the fact that you're treating your paying customers like CRAP! Lastly, one good thing about this place was the wide beer selection.... Basically this is what has kept us coming back, not to mention plain convenience, although last night they were out of a few of our first selections off the menu. Then after ordering our beers, our server handed us a smaller beer menu with the beer options. I'm thinking that now the ONE great thing about this place has been removed! Not a great beer selection, so why go back?!!! :( ATTENTION: Manager or owner should take note or the doors will close forever and that would be a shame because the place has potential to be a long standing staple in the SouthLoop! This is of course is if only the owner would wake up from his slumber and take note of his rude and unfriendly employees!!!! Please make some much needed good changes to this place....

They had live music and charged a cover fee of $5 a person, but it got you a beer. The catch is, you have to buy an additional beer to get the wing special price of 40cents per wing. Lame, if you ask me, since we didn't come for the music and wasn't planning on drinking that night. We just wanted to eat some wings! Anyways, we got buffalo wings and buffal-q wings. The buffalo flavor is a bit spicy but delicious. The buffal-q isn't too bad either. It just tasted like spicy bbq flavor to me. We got side orders of fries, cheese fries, & mac and cheese.

Never have I dealt with someone so shitty in service and he comes up to me asking why I left him a poor tip. On top of that he tried to get in my face.

There were no seats available first off. We went up to the rooftop but they wouldn't let me in because they thought my out of state drivers license was fake. Since time was running short I said whatever I'll pay double the rate, which is the original price and take it to go. We finally found an outdoor table. I came back to the bar to see if the food could be taken to the table once it was ready. The bartender started giving me attitude saying that I already ordered to go. Then when I said I was aware I simply wanted to get the order placed ASAP and now I had found a table she said that I should've waited with to find a table, with a terribly rude voice. I am paying double the amount and still dining in, as well as ordering plenty of drinks for my group at the table like the special requires. I wasn't asking to receive the half off special price anymore I simply wanted it brought to the outdoor table. She made a big fuss about it and when I asked to speak to the manager, it turned out she was the manager!

In tow were our two kids but almost every other table there had kids of some age or another, so I felt comfortable having our kids in what was otherwise a sit-down type establishment. Our wait in line was pretty quick, altho the host tended to walk off to check on various staff instead of standing and taking names. But it's busy, I understand these things, so I was just happy that we got to the front, told him we were two adults and one high-chair and were off to a table instantly. Now he confirmed the whole high-chair thing with me so imagine my surprise when I was left standing for five minutes waiting for someone to bring one by. I ended up asking a staff member if I could go grab one from recently vacated table and was told, \"sure\" in passing as that staffer rushed on to do something else. So I did. And we sat. And we waited.We waited, as aforementioned, and finally after about ten minutes we asked a different passing staffer if we could order. She asked if we wanted our server and I replied that I didn't know we had one, but yes we would. She walked away and a couple minutes later our server arrived for the first time, took our order and walked away. He returned with our drinks, which was promising, so we sat, fed my son some snacks and waited for our food. And waited.We waited, as aforementioned, and finally after about twenty minutes we asked a different passing staffer what the hold-up was. He informed me our server was \"bringing it over right now\" so we left it at that. And we waited. Finally five more minutes passed and most of our food was brought over. Most, but not all. So still we waited for our full meal to be delivered. Another five minutes and we were there. Not once were we offered refills on our drinks or any apologies offered for the delays. Just a lot of waiting.So Matt, you're asking, surely all this waiting was well worth it! Your meal must have been delicious, nay sumptuous and satisfying. But eh, it really wasn't.

Ordering is counter and food comes out in a jiffy.My go-to is the gyro wrap, decently priced with a heaping of Sysco-frozen, elementary-school crinkled-cut fries. The gyro meat isn't the best, but isn't the worst either. I like it far better than the kabob meat and bifteki, which are both too dry without being flavorful enough. Pita Heaven loads up the pita with a pileful of delicious tzatziki, so if you're a sauce fan, this pita is for you.The chicken wraps come, somewhat puzzlingly, with dijon mustard instead of tzatziki, which provides some insight into this place's target consumer base. If you weren't already tipped off by the Italian beef and hamburger offerings on the menu, that is. That said, the tzatziki is easily substitutable on the chicken shawarma or kebob wrap. Just ask.The baklava is packaged and available on the counter and always looks enticing, but so far I've managed to resist.

The buffet quality is actually pretty good, although a limited selection (only 8 choices of cooked/prep food, and some cold/dessert choices as well). They also tend to offer the same dishes for there buffet each time, or they at least keep 6-7 out of the 8 dishes the same.I really like the tandoori chick and lamb curry the offer, but as mentioned above, if you come here often, the lack of variety can get dull. Buffet goers also get naan but from all my times coming here, it takes like 20 minutes before it arrives, for fast eaters like me, 20 minutes is a lifetime. Service can get inconsistent if its busy.

There were a few customers in there and they have a lunch buffet. The buffet is small, with not too many choices. We decided to take the buffet. The first odd thing was the choice of plates at the buffet. It was a small shallow bowl-kind of plate, good for soups and such. I thought that the regular plates needed to be brought out and I asked the waiter for regular plates. He gruffly said - these are the plates for the buffet. Okay, then! It was impossible to eat from that plate. Every curry mixed in with the next one, super messy and a VERY BAD way to eat an Indian buffet. We sat at our table with our vegetables and curry waiting for over 10 mins for the naan to arrive at our table. I had to flag 3 ppl down to tell them that we were waiting for naan. Terrible service and people skills. The food was ok - definitely not the best out there, certainly not the worst.More ppl walked in for the lunch buffet - the restaurant was still only two thirds full at this point. At 2:10pm, the host came and told us that we should load our plates up because the buffet was going to close in 5 minutes. Who shuts down a lunch service buffet at 2:15pm on a weekend? Its like they don't want to do business. I hate to say this about this South Loop restaurant, but this place sucks!!

He leaned against his best friend and they walked together to a bike shop named Cycle. This bike shop is close making it an obvious choice as Rapido could barely roll. Sarah cried to the mechanic, 'it's his wheel! will he ever dance again!?' 'Don't fret,' the man replied, he fixed the wheel in a jiffy and after a $17 exchange the two were on their way...But then... oh then, a terrible, TERRIBLE thing happened. Sarah took Rapido out for a spin- a ten mile spin. What happened when she finally reached her destination?! Yes, another flat. So the girl returned to Cycle to get Rapido's back tire fixed yet again. The man was very apologetic, 'sorry- so sorry,' and he fixed it in a jiff! Sarah said, 'thank you,' and the two merrily rolled into the sun light... but soon enough- another flat. THIS TIME Sarah (...and Rapido too) was not happy. She had all the intentions of yelling at the mechanic telling him 'what is up' but cat caught her tongue and the man called for a new tube ($44). What did we learn from this excursion you may ask? I don't think it was Cycle after all that gave Rapido his reoccurring flats. However I don't think I should have paid the initial $17 when it didn't help the situation in the least... I would have rather them gave me the new tube in the first place.

The place is small, has 4 tables that seat 2 per table. They have a fountain drink dispenser and also fridges with bottled soda, water and other drinks. Since I was in a slight rush to eat before the show, I just ordered mozzarella sticks and a regular size drink. The food did take quite some time, I think close to ten minutes, which Im not sure why it took so long, was it my order of the sticks? Or are they just slow in general? IDK. Anyway once I got my food, I sat down and boy is the food fresh. It was hot when I got it, I had to force myself to eat the food quickly while it was freshly hot, i didn't burn my mouth, because I had come ice cold coke with me. The mozzarella stick cheese melted when I took a bite out of them, but they did keep their shape before I took a bite. A large layer of fries was underneath the mozzarella sticks. I would say about 8 sticks were in my order and then the bottom of the fries plate was full of fries. I just ordered mozzarella sticks but they threw in the fries too? Wow I have never had that happen to me. More food for the same price! Their only drinks out of the fountain dispenser is either Pepsi OR 7 of their house BMG lemonades, fruit drinks and coke. Its all their own homemade drinks in the dispenser which has 8 drinks, aside from pepsi. Anyway, the guy at the front seemed a little off, he could barely hear me and I was talking in my normal voice, he seemed annoyed and was like \"what??\" I had to speak up more which was unusual but whatever. Long story short, I avoided talking to the guy here the rest of the time I was here. Its a nice take out place, it was my first time here, aside from what I got, they have burgers, chicken, gyros, chicken gyros, gyros burgers, chicken burgers, rotisserie chicken, vienna beef hot dogs, etc etc. I would come back again if I am ever in the area with a friend or two, again there is not much seating, so its more of a take out place. The parking is street parking, you must pay the ticket/valet box in front of this place, unless you plan on taking out or eating very quickly, for the parking meter is $2/hour.

The girls I've worked with have been sweet, but just haven't been as diligent with their work. Well perhaps that's not fair. The first time I came to get a pedicure and my technician treated my poor battered feet as if they were made of glass. I need a firm hand to remove calluses. The massage was nice but I'd rather have the callouses removed than the massage. I feel like I shouldn't have to choose. The polish was pretty and I admire that they carry zoya but polish is secondary when it's mid fall, early winter...I thought she'd removed the calluses with the tool that looks like a cheese grater (sorry for the imagery), but in two days time my heels were rougher than before...which apparently is common...with that tool...a vigorous pumice stone rub down is what I needed...sigh.The no chip manicure is what really let me down. I had a two week old no chip that had to be removed. They don't do just a polish change, you have to purchase a full no-chip manicure (every time, which seems excessive when you get it changed bi-weekly). Either way, there are all kinds of frills that I don't believe are necessary but are appreciated by some. What the tech did that unnerved me is she filed the existing polish so far that it felt hot on my nail. She was filing on top of the polish before she applied the foil and acetone, which isn't uncommon but how far she went down was painful. She brushed off my concern and assured me that what she was doing was normal. I should have stopped her there but I did not want to tell a person how to do their job. My bad. It looked fine, but chipped 2 days later. It can happen, I get that. What didn't surprise (but did disappoint) me was over the next two weeks, 8 of my 10 nails broke, split, or ripped off...you know why.

I can't go more than 2 months without it. I thought, how can I go wrong by going here. I can. It's by going without an Asian friend in tow. First off, I placed over an hour on the meter, dim sum is typically fast so... should be enough time. This place wasn't so fast though. We got there around 2:40 which is the end of dim sum and I asked them if they were still serving (this after waiting over 10 minutes to be acknowledged, even thought there were 4 people walking around in the dining area) one young lady said yes and showed us to a table. Tea was brought out immediately which was a plus but then we waited another 10+ minutes for them to take our order even though the sheet was completely filled out! 15 -20 minutes later, all the food came out at once. Mind you, we were starving and now it's about 40 minutes that we're here. Half the food was cold. I was so disappointed but were so hungry that we just started scarfing stuff down. We were adventurous and tried the quail egg and pork siu mai (not so great - very eggy, e-yu! The deep fried shrimp ball, ah, where's the shrimp?

Whatever, I'll eat cold dim sum at home too but going out, I expect things to be at the correct serving temperature. That's what we get for showing up late! Darn the stupid bathroom break on the Eisenhower.The plus: taro root puff was just wonderful (even when cold!). The shrimp rolls were decent and the rice crepe with crispy skin was very unique. I'm trying to have at least one new thing each time I go for dim sum so we had the fried lotus root cake which was different and OK. As far as the cost, it was decent, $32 for 2 with a 25% tip. Not sure why I tipped so much if they really didn't even care that we were there. Darn these server ethics of mine! It's not like they were even busy! The rush was already gone.

Dim sum comes in standard portions and with tea (we usually get chrysanthemum, though they brought me Lipton once which I thought was rather funny though slightly rude) and crystalized sugar. They generally leave chopsticks at the table and don't ask if you need a fork if you're over fifteen, which is really quite nice (I've used chopsticks since I was six and can peel oranges with them), and the servers tend to treat you as competent. If you know how to order you'll be just fine. I'd recommend the salt and pepper softshell crab, which has been a little salty on occasion but is usually well balanced. The curried squid is the best I've had, though the portions for vegetable dishes are a little sparser than I'd like.This is family-style, so order a variety of dishes and experiment.The prices are lower than the nearby Ming Hin and tastes about the same, making it a better buy if you are looking for a meal, however the atmosphere is considerably less formal. If you don't like being packed in it may be best to visit later in the afternoon as the mornings and evenings get rather busy with families.Bonus points for the lack of moronic tourists in paddy-hats (it's Chicago, not Shandong).OVERALL: This place is worth a visit if you're looking for a good place \u00a0to grab a bite.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 7, 29]}, "7": {"description": "Best place for Dim sum always top notch.

Worst shampoo/blowdry girl ever. Jacinta showed up an hour and half after my appointment time, took breaks to talk on the phone, didn't explain pricing, and ignored request. Explanation Let me begin by saying I am not a salon girl. I typically do all hair care processes myself : condition, cut, style, whatever. Hot Comb reminded me why I should remain a DIY girl for life. Very few times in my adult life have I been completely ignored when explicitly stating a request especially when paying for a service.

I stopped her and asked her to section my hair to keep it stretched. She looked at me like I had 6 heads. She did submit to my request but that was the last comprise for a while. She washed, conditioned, detangled my hair ( aka ripped out). She detangled my hair from the root and refused to make sections prior to blow drying. My hair had turned to straw thanks to that nasty shampoo and was dry coming right out of the bowl. AMAZING! Considering I have Lo porosity hair that takes days to dry naturally I could tell my hair was stripped and dying. I reached up and felt that my hair had matted, tangled and was crying. I did the same. Thats right I sat there with tears rolling down my face watching clumps of hair fall to the floor. She told me we could stop. GREAT! So I can leave with my hair in the worst state I've ever seen and still pay you? Oh no. She then continues to blow fry my hair and I constantly ask her make smaller sections, but she doesn't care. She claims the hair falling out what shed hair. Girl please. Lets not tell lies. One moment she is complimenting my hair, which clearly takes knowledge to maintain, and then insulting me with clearly false claims. Shed hair is not a short broken pieces.  She whips then blowdries the same sections over and over. I tell her to stop and twist the section of hair and ask her to pin it out of the way.

I had my hair straightened by Jacinta, after her assistant ripped what hair I have left out with her smoking gun (i.e. high watt blow dryer and brush). Overall, I just remember why I don't frequent salons. Jacinta reminded me that typically they don't care for your hair. It's all about getting a certain look and if you the client are not able to fit this peg, you are just s%$& out of luck. I'm not asking for miracles, just act like you give a damn.

She is a very friendly and warm person. She also has skills. I have very course kinky coily 4C natural hair. I have not been taking good care of it at all (so it is very dry and in bad condition). However she made it shiny and bouncy and it has lasted for almost 2 weeks. Most of the pictures on yelp show straight styles. However, I got a wash and flat iron with curls, and they looked great. The wash girl is also great. She actually scrubs your scalp and gets it clean. She does a great job. The client before me also had very type-4 hair, and Jacinta got it very very straight. Considering how dry my hair was, it should have sucked every once of moisture out of the humid summer air and puffed up within a few days. However I left Chicago and went to the super-crazy-humid climate of New Orleans. My hair still did not puff up. I am very glad that I found this place. It's close to the metro and close to the loop (I went after work and got there in 30 min). It's now convenient to go after work to have my hair done rather than making the 1 hour or 1 and a half commute to the West or South side somewhere on 2 buses and a train. The price is also reasonable- which I appreciate ($65 for wash, and flat iron that includes a sit under the steamer). I originally was going to try AJ's, but after a phone call to a super rude receptionist and a second super rude conversation from Mr. AJ- I thought twice about giving my money to people who acted like jerks on the phone and decided against it. (They were offended when I asked which stylist were most familiar with coily 4C hair. Their response was- \"What choo mean?! \u00a0All our stylist is good!\" WOW. No thank you. I subsequently heard from the customers in hot comb salon that AJ's stylists are partial to loose curls similar to type-A or B. They definitely would have ruined my hair.

The content of conversations and rude comments were unnecessary. That should never be the case in a place of service dealing with women with all types of backgrounds- the service industry should make customers feel at ease from whatever they are going through during the week- just very uncomfortable ... she also didn't leave any length to the hair I had grown out and suggested I had NO options besides a bob which wasn't entirely true. Ultimately she cut 4 inches off the back and even asked if she could cut more in the back just to complete whatever vision she had for a bob. I didn't want a bob to begin with so I declined the offer to get an even shorter one. I was so discouraged i just let her finish and hated the end result. She also gave me bangs which I haven't worn since I was 10 because I have a round face shape and those don't go well together. Overall I was just really unhappy once I left. The style looks way too old for me and looks like a bad wig from the 80's. \u00a0I gave 2 stars just because my hair was straight when I left which was the only upside.

Jacinta showed up an hour and half after my appointment time, took breaks to talk on the phone, didn't explain pricing, and ignored request. Explanation Let me begin by saying I am not a salon girl. I typically do all hair care processes myself : condition, cut, style, whatever. Hot Comb reminded me why I should remain a DIY girl for life. Very few times in my adult life have I been completely ignored when explicitly stating a request especially when paying for a service. The entire time I was there I was told that I didn't know about/understand my hair, which is shocking because i kept hearing how \" I had a good grade of hair.\"So first I made an 10:0 am appointment and I arrived at 9:45 Jacinta arrived at 11:45. Problem one. So then her assisant, who claims to be all about natural hair, uses the cheapest shampoo in the world, washes my hair in one big lump and then goes to have me sit under the dryer with Miziani conditioner ( silicone city) still in one big lump. I stopped her and asked her to section my hair to keep it stretched. She looked at me like I had 6 heads. She did submit to my request but that was the last comprise for a while. She washed, conditioned, detangled my hair ( aka ripped out). She detangled my hair from the root and refused to make sections prior to blow drying. My hair had turned to straw thanks to that nasty shampoo and was dry coming right out of the bowl. AMAZING! Considering I have Lo porosity hair that takes days to dry naturally I could tell my hair was stripped and dying. I reached up and felt that my hair had matted, tangled and was crying. I did the same. Thats right I sat there with tears rolling down my face watching clumps of hair fall to the floor. She told me we could stop. GREAT! So I can leave with my hair in the worst state I've ever seen and still pay you? Oh no. She then continues to blow fry my hair and I constantly ask her make smaller sections, but she doesn't care. She claims the hair falling out what shed hair. Girl please. Lets not tell lies. One moment she is complimenting my hair, which clearly takes knowledge to maintain, and then insulting me with clearly false claims. Shed hair is not a short broken pieces.  She whips then blowdries the same sections over and over. I tell her to stop and twist the section of hair and ask her to pin it out of the way. She listens for all of 2 sections and then unwraps and re blow dry and dry section. Thanks for the heat exposure. So I'm done crying and just want to leave. I have been there for 2 hours at this point and the famous flat ironing Jancita has just gotten ready for me. She then flat irons my hair until it is straight, limp, and thin. I AM TALKING LIFELESS. I said I didn't want my hair very straight to which she replied, \" everyone should see their hair straight at least once\" and then she flat ironed my hair to the point where it looked like I had a bad relaxer. All of this while she answered 2 calls and stopped to talk to two salesman that came in. She didn't explain the pricing and just gave me a number which was different from the website. My boyfriend picked me up and asked me on sight \" when are you going to give that girl back her weave\" my hair is thin and wispy and I fear heat damaged. I would NEVER go back. I tried to be open to the experience, but after hours of being ignored and listening to other stylist inappropriate \u00a0conversation ( they were discussing a \" homosexuals man\" from some TV show making jokes about his sexuality) I can honestly say this was a horrible experience that will not be repeated again.

It's unfortunate this location lacks the professionalism of the other locations. I give this 2 stars only because I will continue to eat at the other locations. I have eaten at the South Loop restaurant three times in the past 6 weeks. Problem #1 - we requested \u00a0a table for 3 and mentioned we had a friend arriving late. We said we were going to order right away. We were told they would make an exception and seat us, but they usually wait until all the people in our party are present. They weren't busy! In fact the restaurant was only half capacity. Our server wasn't too happy and noticeably annoyed we were taking up a table. Problem #2 - As a vegetarian, I haven't had any problems ordering dishes without meat. I had the Tamitillo Egg Scramble without the chicken. It tasted like watered down eggs with absolutely no flavor. When I asked the server to take it, I asked if the lack of flavor was due to not ordering chicken. She said yes and proceeded to tell me she knew that when I ordered. Why didn't she mention it at the time? She took my plate but didn't offer me an alternative dish. I had to ask for a HALF order of pancakes. Problem #3 - \u00a0Our friend arrived and quickly ordered a simple cheese omelette. She received an egg white omelette... Not sure how that was lost in translation. She asked the server to take it away and remove it from the bill. Ultimately, we were charged for 4 entrees! Three of which shouldn't have been charged. We paid it anyway but asked to speak to the manager on the way out. We stated the facts and although he apologized, he made an excuse that the restaurant gets loud and it's hard to hear orders. Was it our fault? My friend is acquaintances with the owner. In fact they are clients of hers. Interesting... the manager disregarded that comment.

It wasn't terribly sweet so it was very manageable to finish the pancake.

No seasonings just the good ole American way of throwing a piece of cheese on it and tasteless oil. I will give this place another chance during the week when it's not busy and try a different dish.

They split a toasted croissant and crammed it with sprouts, tomatoes, spinach, cheese, and a fried egg. The cheese is typically melted muenster but they gladly substituted goat cheese upon my request. I loved the contrasting textures and the taste was also very good. The only real drawback for me was that the sandwich was on the messier side. As for those herbed house potatoes, I loved them. The white cheddar cheese was a nice touch as well. My two friends ordered pancakes and liked their orders to a degree. I tried a few bites. The health bar pancake legitimately tasted like a heath bar but it was too sweet for me.

The wait staff was perfectly pleasant. I really wanted to try one of their French toast options, but I went with an omelette. I got bacon, spinach, and smoked Gouda. The omelette came with potatoes and toast. The omelette was literally whole pieces of raw baby spinach, big slices of bacon, and some Gouda thrown in the middle of an egg. Eh. I get that this is an omelette, but the presentation was lacking and I wasn't impressed. I make better omelettes at home and cooking breakfast isn't my forte. But, I digress. The potatoes were ok and the toast was toast. The best thing I had was the coffee and the worst thing I got was a phone call regarding my repair estimate.

Two eggs, toast, potatoes, and coffee make me the happiest person ever. That or a breakfast sandwich, which is essentially half of those items put together to make a heavenly sandwich.So, to be recommended to this little, very non-descript breakfast spot, I didn't know what I had in store. We arrived 10 minutes before it opened and we were third in line. I knew from that moment on, we were probably in for a treat. As soon as it opened the servers and busers were lined up to take each party back to the dining area. Again, if you were to look at this place, you may think it was a generic cafeteria. Everything is made with the bright, light colored wood (think IKEA), concrete walls, with splashed of blue and green. I wasn't judging this book, by its cover...I was just taking it all in.The menu isn't huge, but now I know why it doesn't have to be. I, as usual, went for the Croissant Sandwich. It is always what I'll go with when I want to be a little more adventurous for breakfast. J loves sweet for breakfast, but he wasn't too sure about pretzels in his pancakes. But after speaking with our server, she assured him this \u00a0decision was what many others make on a daily basis.I don't do sweets for breakfast, but I probably stole more than my fair share of his White Chocolate & Carmel Pretzel Pancakes that morning. Event typing the name I feel like I'll get a cavity. However, by some magical stroke of genius \u00a0they've created a pancake that isn't overly sweet, with just the right amount of sweetness and fluff! Seriously, these pancakes look like they are dripping in sugar, but once you take a bite, you are transcended into whatever pancakes in Heaven should taste like. The blend of the white chocolate and caramel, combined with the fluffy (not too dense) pancake, sprinkled with bits of pretzel is something that I can't even begin to describe.I also shouldn't forget to talk about my actual breakfast, not go on an done about the one I kept stealing. The croissant was amazing, buttery and flakey, just how I love them. I opted for egg whites and they were not shy with their portions. I did not like the potatoes, they were too 'wet' for my liking, but had great seasoning and flavors. If they were crispy, they would have been the equivalent to breakfast crack! Sadly, I left most of them on my plate.Both breakfast portions were huge, sadly we couldn't finish either of them to their entirety. We both also ordered the Intelligentsia coffee, which we was also recommended to us by the same person. We enjoyed way too many cups of this caffeinated goodness, they even provided soy milk at no cost (follow suit CA)! It was basically packed since opening, but they have so many people working your coffee cup never gets empty, your food comes out fast, and their kitchen is killing it back there. It is a well oiled machine, that not only knows how to manage the breakfast rush, but their dishes already speak for themselves.

I was going to skip dinner but as my eyes browsed through the list of food places my stomach started growling. So I made my way to the restaurant which isn't very hard to find considering how humongous this hotel is. From the north tower, go straight past the lobby to the south tower, then make a left then past the escalator on your right & snack shop on your left. You'll reach the end of the hall. Across is Forno ( Italian ) and on your immediate right is Shor. Before I asked for a seat, I was presented with 3 menus. Turns out that each menu is designated to a certain room. Since it's dinner time, the main room was pretty occupied. Sandwich menu and drinks/appetizer menus to the other two smaller rooms. Don't know why they have this arrangement but it must work for them. I chose the menu with the steak since I needed to fill my gut really quick here. The room was large, quite dim but cozy. Groups on the other side and couples and solo guests along the entrance. I was served right away and my steak arrived in 10 mins. I ordered a medium rare 14 oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato. Although the meat was tender & juicy, it needed more flavor. I sliced through the meat and the left half was cooked medium & the right half was med rare, didn't complain about it. I was hungry. The baked potato although it was also good was on the cool/warm side. Price wasn't too bad. Steak, loaded potato, a beverage plus taxes, it came down to $47. In California, at a restaurant with a 3 star rating, that price is just for the steak & taxes (not even Filet mignon). Customer service was excellent. I wish my waitress gave me her name. She was so attentive and made sure my glass is refilled constantly. When I left the restaurant, I didn't realize that I left my leather jacket on my chair. I kept walking & stopped by the snack shop to grab a bottle of Gatorade and then one of the managers approached me and asked if I left my jacket somewhere. All of a sudden it dawned on me that it was my jacket . I thanked him for it. I've left some items in restaurants before like a hat, scarf, pen, etc but no one has ever made an effort to find me later on for something I've left behind. Kudos to this manager. Again, I wish I asked for his name. If the business owner is reading this, I was at Shor on 3/28 at 8 pm and left around 9ish.

I didn't really know what to expect when I went in. My appointment was recorded incorrectly, but they got me in within 15 minutes, since another person didn't show. My teeth were at least 4 shades whiter and I was very pleased!Staff was friendly. The actual facility is connected to a Pilates (I think, or yoga) studio, so that was a little confusing and threw me off... getting my teeth whitened but hearing a pilates instructor 10 feet away. Aside from that, clean facility. Note: I consider myself to have sensitive teeth. I use Crest White Strips (sensitive formulation) and still get that 'feeling' after using them. Secondly, I feel like my teeth whiten relatively easily (using white-strips gets them white just after 3-4 uses). Everyone's teeth whiten differently, so go in w/ that expectation. The actual process is simple. You go in a room, sit down in a chair and the process beings:- You're given Vitamin E swabs to put on your gums (try not to get it on your teeth). They didn't explain what this was used for, but found out that it's to protect your gums from the process. Tip: request 2 - one for the top and one for the bottom (I have bigger gums, however). - You're then given a plastic 'mouth spreader', which is used to spread your mouth open like Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. - You're then given the mouthpiece w/ the whitener.- Finally, they put a bib on you, because YOU WILL DROOL like a dog in front of a plate of bacon! Tip: you can bring your own or request tissues, since the bib isn't meant to absorb, just protect and collect said drool. - If you signed-up for 60 mins, they'll do this process twice (once to start then again in 30 mins)ProTips: Bring your headphones. I listened to a podcast and music for the hour - otherwise, you'll just end up focusing too much on your helpless drooling face. USE THE VITAMIN E! My gums 'burned' in a couple spots where I missed and were sensitive for 2 days after. You'll tell your gums are burned bc they'll be WHITE in certain spots (it'll go away after about 20-30 mins and go back to your normal color but remain sensitive). Keep your head tilted back a bit to avoid over-drool and ensure the bib is positioned right, or the drool can go down your chin. If you're lucky, the curtain to your room and the one adjacent or across from you will be open just enough to see your fellow neighbor and helpless drooler also looking as strange as you!", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 10, 26]}, "14": {"description": "If you want your pearly whites shades whiter and your smile looking brand spankin' \u00a0new, go to Smiling Bright. \u00a0 \u00a0 I bought the deal off of Groupon and bought another session before I left because I loved the results so much. \u00a0How good were the results, you asked? \u00a04, count 'em 4 shades whiter and I left feeling like the girl from the Orbit commercials. \u00a0The whole procedure was a piece of cake and the ladies that helped were friendly. \u00a0I was in and out in a jiffy, leaving time to spend my hard earn birthday money on some new threads. \u00a0 So, yes-the procedure uses the device that goes in your cheeks to open your mouth. \u00a0But if anyone has ever had braces, this shouldn't be a big deal. \u00a0I went through 4 years with monthly encounters with \"the stretcher\" as I liked to call it, with no skin off my nose. \u00a0Paste tray fit right in, the light was placed over my mouth, I put my headphones in and took a little cat nap. \u00a0 \u00a0 Yes, my gums were also a little white on the bottom, it went away quickly and they told me that it could happen. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Need I say it again? \u00a0Beauty is pain-and this was well worth it.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two thumbs up for this fine establishment!", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 8, 27]}}, "latitude": 41.8660152, "neighborhoods": ["Near Southside"], "categories": [["Teeth Whitening", "teethwhitening"]], "address": ["1247 S Wabash Ave"], "attributes": {"By Appointment Only": "Yes", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes"}, "longitude": -87.6256451, "category": "Beauty", "rating": "4.0", "price": "$$", "number_of_reviews": "32"}, "bacon-and-beer-classic-chicago": {"comments": {"1": {"description": "The vip tickets were definitely NOT worth it.

The good of the festival of course was the beer - 44 local (and a bit further out) breweries were in attendance. Each brewery offered 1-3 flavors with most having 2 flavors.

That being said some breweries had awesome employees there and others had reps who were completely disinterested & miserable. I'm always sad to see the unhappy people because it never bodes well for a brewery!Lines for beer were usually about 10 people deep but always moved fairly quickly. Lines for food were on another level! Each food line had about 50 people and many were stopped as places ran out of food very early. Most places didn't have food after the first hour and the ones that did....their lines grew....and grew....and grew! Not worth waiting in a Disneyland-esque line for a bit of baconwhatevertheyhad.

I was grateful to get them because there really wasn't anything even close to like them. I'd had bar sliders at other restaurants and they always had too much bun, often not soft enough. And as most things in Cali are, way too much money for the privilege of being disappointed.I moved back to my beloved hometown in October. I live in the Gold Coast and there are NO White Castles! OMG! i did not know this. I just assumed that there would be at least ONE nearby.I had occasion to find myself with friends on the south side, so always took advantage of getting some while i was there. I'd get a sack to take home for later and they would either get eaten and then not replenished before I got back, or I'd leave them in my friend's freezer. So basically, I have STILL been eating the frozen version! i hate to admit it, but I was. I love to have them in the freezer for a quick snack. Sometimes I even dress them up like a real burger with lettuce, tomato, mustard and mayo. Don't laugh; they're good! \u00a0I always get the cheeseburgers.I've been aiming to get down to this location, the closest to the north side where I live. I hear there's one on North Ave., but I think it's further away. I may check it out in any case.Today I finally decided to make the trek down there. As it was around 20 degrees out -- I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy. I took the Red Line over to Chinatown and walked a few blocks in the wrong direction (thanks, Google Maps) -- then walked the other way 'till I found it. I've heard this neighborhood isn't the greatest. I think because it is cold out, the streets were pretty deserted. But there were some random people walking around, some of which looked a little sketchy. They were kinda checking me out, at which time I pretend to be on my cell phone just in case anyone decides to try anything. This was several blocks away on South Wabash. There were some other folks kinda hangin' out in the street which was a little odd, but I just mind my own business and get where I gotta go. I'd imagine when the weather gets nicer, there will be more street action. I don't plan on being in the vicinity at night unless I happen to be in a car (which is unlikely, given that I gave up the rolling tin can when I moved here).It's a tiny store -- no where to sit. The staff was friendly. I ordered a sack of 10 cheeseburgers, 5 of those marvelous pulled pork numbers they just came out with and got a free sweet potato fries order. They're really good, as well. I waited quite a while, during which time a few other people showed up and because the place is so small, everyone kind of lines up along the wall. I was glad to wait, because that means the burgers are fresh. I shoved 'em in my backpack, grabbing one, hot, steamy little burger to have for lunch before heading off to Target on the #29. I ate it by the large trash can because it was too cold to be eating outside, no where to do it anyway and I was starving, dammit! Then at the bus stop just up the block and around the corner, I scarfed down another one while waiting for the bus. A woman who appeared to be on crack was dancing on the corner, a travel mug at her feet, hollerin' at friends as they walked by (they talked back and sounded like they knew her). God only knows why she was hangin' on the corner in this cold. Doesn't seem probable that she was a hooker, but one never knows. There was some random guy hangin' out with her.

A standard slider is very easy to eat, travels well, and is kind of elegant in its simplicity, if you think about it. It just contains onions, seasoning, possibly cheese and a thin slice of ground beef. The crinkle fries aren't very impressive, so if you had to watch your carb count, those can easily go in lieu for another slider.Much like the challenges that Harold and Kumar faced in order to get to White Castle, I, and a friend, faced a few challenges to get to this White Castle from our hotel along the Mag Mile. First off, there was rain. That usually is enough to deter most from coming here, but since the closest White Castle to my home state of California is here in Chicago, and this was my only free time to go and get it, I had little choice but to brave the wind and rain if I wanted to finally see what the hype is about.Our bus (I believe it was #29) going southbound was late, and when it finally came around on Rush Street, it just drove past us on the bus stop, presumably to make up for lost time. Naturally, everyone waiting at the stop was pissed. The next bus would come another 15 minutes later, making us run behind schedule. I also should have done a bit more research earlier to find out that this particular White Castle in the Near Southside doesn't have a formal dining room. We only chose it because it was closer to our hotel than the one on the north end by a few miles. Had we known there was a lack of seating, we probably would have trekked the longer distance to have a better dining experience. Though it's open 24 hours, this WC only has outside tables and a walk-up window/drive-thru. \u00a0Since we didn't have a car to eat in, we had to eat our sliders under an awning along the side of the restaurant, since, of course, we took public transit to get here and the tables were wet from the rain.But, in eating my first slider outside in the drizzle, one can see the steam more clearly and thus the hot burger probably felt more satisfying going down than it would normally have been. Though the beef isn't much, I really think that it was all in the seasoning. WC probably puts sprinkles of crack in their salt and pepper seasoning because those things can be eaten anywhere from one to three bites easily. The soft slider buns also aren't really much of a hindrance for those looking to scarf down a few of these...they collapse on themselves when you breathe on them, basically.I liked the sliders' packaging, since it makes efficient use of a bag (see my photo posted on this article to see the box the sliders come in). They can \"lock up\" two boxes end-to-end like two ends of a jigsaw puzzle and stack them in a paper bag for to-go orders. The boxes also serve to continually keep the steamy contents, well, steamy.On the way back to the hotel we discussed why we didn't bother splitting one of the larger crave box combos (containing something like 30 sliders), and instead went for individual combos (I went with the #1 with cheese). I suppose, since it was my first time, I didn't want to be too pot-committed in the off-chance that I wouldn't like it.

As we approached our destination, we were approached by a troll, although instead of three riddles he asked us if we had a dollar. Not sure what possessed him to do so, but my friend cracked a smile, and kind of chuckled a bit. Of course it had to do with this land trolls delivery of his all so important question. He burst into a beautifully written prose containing such adjectives as F*, M F'er, foreign M'fer and stupid white M'fer. My group consisted of three Mexicans, but one of us was darker than the rest, upon which the troll decided to label us foreign and white (most white people think I'm white anyway.)Upon arrival to this White Castle, we encountered a young crackhead that was ordering ice water. She explained that she mixed the ice water with corn starch and proceeded to eat it. Not sure what kind of concoction this produces, but I was definitely intrigued.Afterward, a real life pimp with a cane and a white suit walked in the door. We struck up some conversation and he proceeded to tell us about how great and how delicious White Castle was. I was surely convinced after such an adventure that we were about to consume the best food god has blessed the world with. Boy was I wrong, the burgers are flavorless, and instantly gave me heart burn. I'm not sure if you could describe the meat as meat.

She says she's the owner but I'll be in good hands with the other lady. Ok?!? I sat for another 20 mins while I watched the hairdresser go back to the back to eat something then come get me. I told her I wanted to change my blonde curly coils to warm chocolate brown #4. I showed several colors and she said ok that would be easy. So she placed the color on the roots first and just let me sit while she took ANOTHER customer which was a friend of hers that just walked in. DANGER! She then came back over in looked thru my hair and placed color on ends. I asked if everything was ok and if the color should stay that long. She said it was fine. Well she finished her friend then went to wash my hair. I told her my hair curls up quickly so can't leave me just sitting at bowl. What did she do? Left me with my head in the bowl while she and several other workers sat around smacking on chicken! She then placed me under dryer and when I came out, my hair was nowhere near chocolate brown...well a line of my roots were! I looked like a raccoon with 3-4 colors striped thru my hair!!!

I asked for Ms. Lisa, who is the owner of two shops of Red Karma in Chicago. I was happy \u00a0and impressed that she as owner was willing to take a new client.

I really did like that she did not give me a hard time.The south loop space was great, warm, inviting, and modern. There were products for sale, but no one push them hard, which was nice . I liked that everyone getting their hair done had great looking hair. The lady that was in the chair with Ms. Lisa before me was impressive...she told me my hair would look like hers after Ms. Lisa was though...I got excited. I got a relaxer, trim, wash and iron out. I should have asked for the blow out, but it was still turned out really nice. I loved the way my hair felt and the relaxer brand, tho I never heard of it, was good. Ms. Lisa gave me great feedback about how I had been taking care of my hair, improvements, and recommendations. As a KISS.biz member, I am happy to say that Ms. Lisa really does do healthy hair care. No small combs, my hair was washed in cold water, essential oils used, short relaxer processing time, and most of the tips she gave me I remember seeing on KISS.biz. Its great that I did not have to explain my HHJ to her and that she was supportive of my own hair maintenance. Prices were ok; not bad tho. I only go to the hair shop once every 3 months, so $70 is ok for me. But Ms. Lisa did give me a free first time client trim. I was expecting the price to be in the $80's without the tip.

When I wash and go after coming here, my cut always works just as well for my heatless hair as it does when straight. I recommended Cynthia to a coworker who gets a sew-in and now she goes to her exclusively (and this coworker is VERY particular about her hair).The shop itself is cool and has a slightly different set-up with semi private rooms for each stylist. Everyone is friendly and it just has a great vibe. Making appointments and paying is painless (I can add tip to my credit card!) and professionally handled.

The pros: It's two blocks from my new digs, it's very clean and modern, the people are extremely friendly and nice and I got a very good pedicure at the same price I was paying in Colorado...The only cons today were that I had to wait for about 30 minutes (which they kept apologizing profusely for). I didn't mind because I didn't work today. The second (small) con was that they did not have my favorite OPI color in stock so I had to go with a different color. No big deal- they said they would order it. Basically, the couple who owns it or manages it are SUCH cool, friendly people (not to mention great looking) that it really negates anything else that someone might find lacking.

But yelp almighty wont allow it! Anyways, so I made an appt for a no chip mani ($40, pretty stndard I thought). I show up 10 minutes before the appointment time and there is one technician available and another doing nails. First impression: cluttered (bags of nail utensils and supplies everywhere), unclean (read paper towels on the flower, containers w nail clippers, files and other tools of trade without any rubbing alcohol or whatever they use to sanitize them!), suffocatingly small place with scraped up walls and old fixtures, even the pedi equipment (chairs n tubs) looked super old! \u00a0But never mind I thought...never judge the book by its cover...Anyways, I sat down and she started taking off my old no chip. It wouldnt come off so she tried soaking again and again...and then simply just filed a couple of nails down, which is fine. Then she proceeded to shape my nails and I noticed that she hasnt worked on my cuticles! She didnt even push them back or anything! When she was clipping my nails earlier she cut one of them too deep so I yelped (hehe) and she said sorry and I guess was too afraid to do anything else that couldve caused me discomfort...??? \u00a0But honestly I have never gone to a nail salon and not gotten my cuticles cut, treated or at least pushed back!! So an hour n 10 mins later I walked away with naked nails, mad cuticles in tact and somewhat softer hands. As she was awkwardly filing my nails into a horrible shape I decided I wasnt going to waste $40 on this. So I said lets just do a regular mani and she happily accepted and said i need to give my nails a break cuz theyre too dry. I said fine. So another 20 minutes time, \u00a0some scrub and lotion action later I paid $25 and walked away with not even a clear polish. What a ripoff on time and money, right? I tipped her, yes I did, because she spent 1 hour 10 minutes working on me however useless that time mightve been. And she was nice...but nice dont make ur nails look pretty, right?!?

Yet, I will agree that there are improvements to be made of which I'll name here. For starters, the woman over the phone failed to tell me a precise time for my pickup order. An hour to an hour and a half is what I expect from a cable company planning a visit to my house, not a pizza place. So I arrived after an hour hoping for the best. Sitting on the counter was a stack of pizza boxes filled with pickup orders. So a word of caution to you future customers - if you waited the full 90 minutes, chances are your pizza may be sitting on the counter for 30+ minutes before you bring it home. A warmer of some sort would help this situation. I paid and was on my way. They have numerous styles offered including thin crust, medium crust, stuffed and deep dish. I was hoping for the Connie's style cheese on top deep dish when placing my order but ended up getting the sauce on top Uno's style pizza. I also ordered a small thin crust to get a good variety of what this place has to offer. The thin crust was decent. It reminded me of the Nancy's chain thin crust pizza from the suburbs but not as good. The deep dish needed help. Sauce was everywhere. I've made that mistake at home when making deep dish pizza - don't over sauce. It becomes a landslide of red lava that moves everywhere but onto your plate when picking up a slice. The crust on the end, however, was tasty and I felt it was the best part of the pie. I'm a crust lover and this place was respectable. With a few changes I'd give this place 4 stars. No, it's not the best pizza in the city but it's better than any national chain and a lot of other mediocre parlors.

It also helped to balance all the flavors.We also ordered the Crab Rangoon. This was very different from Chinese restaurant versions. It was folded differently, almost like a little bag, so all the stuff inside would ooze out when you bite into it. The skin was extremely crispy. The filling was flavorful. We loved it. This was our favorite here.My sister ordered the Gaeng Pet Ped (Red curry with roasted duck, pineapple and tomatoes). This was different.

They will substitute tofu as protein for any of their dishes. The soup tom yum broth was really flavorful and tat is where the good things end. They don't have soft tofu and they use this tofu which they semi fry but the texture is really tough and taste like old tofu which has been sitting around for long. The basil fried rice was not spicy nor tasted or smelt of basil. The Pad Ped (Normally my fav Thai Curry) had no gravy/sauce and the veges were still left raw so they had no flavor. The fresh roll does not taste or look like a fresh roll - it is a semi fried veg roll with tofu and sauce poured over it.

We made our way over to the bar and luckily got a spot. We decided to order our first two rounds because of the crowds. I will say that the bartenders were rocking it in here. There was no reason to pre-buy round two because of the quick speed of the staff. They were really attentive. I love it when a staff gets it and works there butts off because once the game starts its probably going to be a ghost town in there. I always believe in keeping the customers happy at all costs. I checked the menu prior to walking in. I noticed there was food available but we did not order anything. They also had pitchers of beer too starting at $12. Now that's a great deal and very old school. I love it. We didn't go pitcher but choose to go bottles for $4 each. Up the street, the fancy Nancy bars charge about 2 bucks more per beer. So if you're looking for a deal then this is the place. We finished up our beers and made our way over to see the Bears. On a side note: This place has a small outdoor patio with about 4 tables.

As much as I love a hole in the wall, this place puts in a damn good effort in decor. Wish they did that for their food...Food overall is 3 stars. The togarashi chips with edamame hummus was a great looking app, but the flavor was lacking. The chips were fresh fried, but not drained well. Way too much oil to start a meal with. Ordered the butternut squash soup. Lots of good reviews on this, but I've had so much better. The flavor was almost flat (the basil tries hard to save it). If I can make better at home, I don't want to pay 3 times as much at a restaurant to butcher it. \u00a0They switched it out for the miso soup....meh. The hot soup felt good, but still pretty flat on flavor. The only winner was the gamma veg roll. I split this with a friend, and so glad I did. The pieces are huge. Normally, I don't care for that, but it had everything vegetarian you could put in a roll: beets, jalape\u00f1o (not spicy, wish it was), sweet potato. Outside was tempura with sesame. \u00a0If it wasn't for this, the meal would have been a disappointment. Service: 2 stars - no host. Waited about 5-7 minutes before a server recognized that we needed to be seated in a half empty room. \u00a0There were not a lot of suggestions or much conversation. The server that helped the table next to is was incredibly friendly. He had in depth explanations of some dishes and an overall engaged attitude. I wish he was our server.

Then we waited for 35+ mins and my friend went inside to let her know we are outside waiting and the girl at the desk was totally out of it. My friend wasn't sure if she even understood what he told her. Then I went inside 15 mins later and asked what's going and then another girl was shaking her head at the original girl and put our name on another waiting list. I asked how long the wait was and she said she didn't know. Then we wait for another 15 minutes and then a girl came outside and said oh our manager said its okay to seat people outside. \u00a0And we said fine and asked if we could order right away. Then we waited for over 50 minutes. During this time, a party of 15 who was in the restaurant after us finished and left before we even had our food... And the whole row of tables near us also had their food way before us and even finished. Every time the waitress walked out, my friends and I were so disappointed. MIND YOU, THERE WERE THREE OF US and we really didn't order much food at all. We finally got our food 10 minutes short of being there for two hours. They didn't even follow my order, I asked for a specific topping on top! And my other friend asked for light cheese and mushrooms! At that point, we were too tired and hungry to complain so we just ate it . Then we finished, asked for a box and I asked the waitress if she could give us a discount because we were in the restaurant for over 2 hours at that point and my friend missed his train to the suburbs. She said she would talk to the manager and walked away before I even got a chance to mention the rest of my qualms such as messing up my order, making us wait so long in comparison to the other groups. Then she walks out with a check that's $5 off of a bill of $50. REALLY?!? I have never felt so disrespected and disappointed. After all that crap, they take $5 off of the bill and no one bothered to apologize? We ended up giving that $5 and more back in tip.

My friend wasn't sure if she even understood what he told her. Then I went inside 15 mins later and asked what's going and then another girl was shaking her head at the original girl and put our name on another waiting list.

Then we wait for another 15 minutes and then a girl came outside and said oh our manager said its okay to seat people outside. \u00a0And we said fine and asked if we could order right away. Then we waited for over 50 minutes. During this time, a party of 15 who was in the restaurant after us finished and left before we even had our food...

They didn't even follow my order, I asked for a specific topping on top! And my other friend asked for light cheese and mushrooms! At that point, we were too tired and hungry to complain so we just ate it . Then we finished, asked for a box and I asked the waitress if she could give us a discount because we were in the restaurant for over 2 hours at that point and my friend missed his train to the suburbs. She said she would talk to the manager and walked away before I even got a chance to mention the rest of my qualms such as messing up my order, making us wait so long in comparison to the other groups. Then she walks out with a check that's $5 off of a bill of $50. REALLY?!? I have never felt so disrespected and disappointed. After all that crap, they take $5 off of the bill and no one bothered to apologize? We ended up giving that $5 and more back in tip.

There were 4 people at least behind the bar and it was almost like they were purposefully avoiding eye contact (maybe just with people who had ordered water?). I eventually was able to place an order and after that waited a very long time to get my takeout meal. I timed how long it took from when I sat down until when I walked away with the takeout bag: 1 hour (1 hungry hour!).

We wanted something easy for before the Bears vs Cowboys game that wouldn't get us stuck in pre game traffic. Since we were staying in the hotel we decided to give it a shot. When we arrived it looked like a lot of other hotel guests/ game goers had the same idea as we did. There was only one open table that had yet to be cleaned from the previous guests. We grabbed it and waited. And waited. And then began to wonder if we were supposed to be ordering at the bar. Just as we were about to head up to the bar to ask a waitress showed up. We weren't sure there were any servers because in the ten minutes we had waited we hadn't seen a single one. It quickly became apparent that she was the only server on duty for the entire restaurant which seemed like poor planing considering the staff was well aware of the football game. We ordered nachos and a Kobe beef burger. The nachos were huge which was nice since they cost $12.00. They were pretty tasty too. The Kobe burger was a tad over cooked but the smoked cheddar cheese was nice. The $15.00 price tag was fairly reasonable for Kobe beef also which was unexpected in a hotel bar. The biggest issues we had were the price of the soft drinks at $4.00 each which were never refilled and the waiting we had to do for the check while the one poor waitress tried to scramble around assisting everyone in the entire place.

She opened the door, said \"hi,\" and stared at me like I was coming to her house to sell her something. There was no greeting, no \"nice to meet you, have a seat, I'll be with you in a moment.\" Nothing. I asked if she was Zoe (honestly I wasn't sure since I was getting the blank stare), she said yes and then quickly disappeared into a room. I was left standing there so I found a seat in the waiting room and waited. And waited. And waited. There was a woman walking around that I assumed was her assistant.

I told the assistant that I had to leave and her response? \"You're going to be really sorry. You're missing out on a great manicure.\" The reality is that there are lots of places to get a good manicure in Chicago. In addition, there are lots of places that treat their customers with respect and value their time. So, no, I'm not \"missing out.\" The real person who's missing out is Zoe. She just lost a cash paying client who gets manis and pedis all the time, and who decided to give a neighborhood small business a chance. She may have amazing skills but I assume that she has all the clients she needs/wants and is not looking to expand. In all fairness, she did send me an email apology later that day and offered to give me a free manicure. That was a nice gesture. But, honestly, I think I would have been more impressed if she had informed me that she was running 30 minutes late when I got there OR when I told her assistant I had to leave, she would have communicated with me while I was standing there that she was sorry for the delay.

The prices are higher than popeye or KFC, however the chicken is larger and fried right on the spot. Typically you will have to wait 10-20 minutes before getting your meal. They also have fried fish, liver, giblet, etc. Make sure you bring cash as they have a service fee for credit cards through this weird ATM like machine....

This Harold's is cash-only but then has a pin pad that is an \"ATM\". The cashier tells you how much to take out (ie: If your order is $12, they will tell you to take out $15, if it's $8, they will have you take out $10). Then the \"ATM\" dispenses a ticket and you give it to the cashier, then the cashier gives you the change for the difference. This wasn't explained to me, so I took out more cash (I figured if I was paying a fee to my bank, I might as well get more cash so I didn't make another ATM trip) and then the cashier screamed at me for it because she had to give me more cash. This whole thing smells of money laundering to me. EDIT: This ATM is now gone, and they accept credit cards.-This place is kept moderately clean but tends to attract...an interesting clientele.

When you first drive in there is a board that shows you the three parking levels and how many parking spots exist on each level. Now you may think that is not important but when your running late for your way too expensive movie and drinks here, it becomes important really fast. You won't spend your time on level 1 which has only 20 spots left versus level 3 which has 300 spots. The smart technology will help you, so make sure you peak at the board at the front. As you are driving to your spot you will see red lights and green lights above every aisle. These lights direct you to open parking spots. It's like a game of PacMan as you are eating up the pellets. Follow the lights until you see green. The green lights tell you that there are spots down there and of course the red lights tell you there are no spots available. I've decided to share this valuable info because I do not think some of the drivers have figured this out. I keep seeing people searching down the red aisles. Stop doing it and let the parking technology help you. Now don't be confused by the blue light, those are for handicap drivers. This is the smartest parking lot I've ever seen. I'd also love to recommend this parking lot to Candice our community manager in the Burbs because she has so many bad experiences in Chicago parking garages. This might actually make her day plus its currently free. Yes it's free but I do not know how long it will be free for. When they built this place they originally charged for parking and it seemed too expensive. The build it and they will come attitude didn't seem to work. The give people free parking and they will come seems to be working better. I've also noticed that many of the vacant store fronts will be getting new stores soon. Now I must admit this mall seems like a place you would find in Miami. Just walk around and you will see what I am talking about. There's flowers everywhere and music playing as you stroll the paths. There are places to stop and reflect like the fish pond or the chairs surrounding the outdoor fire pits. The fire pit is a good thing on a crisp November day. There's a giant chess board, if your inclined to get a workout in too. Finally there is a play ground for the kids in the middle. All of these activities are in the center of the mall and I haven't even covered the stores yet. Currently the big anchors are the Icon movie theater which is probably the nicest & most expensive theater in Chicago. They offer VIP seating with food & full bar. And for shopping there is a large H&M store. My favorite store, Z Galleria is here. I was sad when it closed down in Lincoln Park but it has resurfaced here. There's a Men's Only Store called Haberdash, which not only sells you clothes but can offer you coffee and a shave. For the ladies there's a Loft, Black / White and other places to shop. In the center there's a Bridgeport Coffee. Those are just a few of the stores but there are more coming. I noticed a soap store, pet food store and sushi place going through construction.The free parking is working its bringing the customers and the retailers into the empty spots. I hope the owners of this mall realize this but I feel there gonna get greedy and bring back the paid parking. Hopefully they read this review and have a change of heart. There is also a great view of the Sears Tower from here. A million dollar view along with a unique shopping and entertaining experience.

Since this is a \"temporary\" venue, do not expect any of the features you would find in fixed-structure venues, such as weather protection, real bathrooms, or a functional layout. The Friday night show was cancelled at the mid-point due to severe weather, since the venue is basically a trailer park with a stage and some bleachers, offering no protection. If you are attending a show where the weather might be an issue, I would recommend devising a game plan in advance, especially since the venue does not seem to have one and assumes everyone can just seek shelter in their car. Why not just have everyone evacuate to the Soldier Field covered parking structures?With the bathrooms (those outside of the lawn), I wonder if these trailers were picked up on sale from FEMA, as they could not possibly be any smaller. Although, on the plus side, they have air conditioning. \u00a0Here are some helpful hints when attending concerts at this venue:Transportation - I highly recommend checking with the venue on the parking options available for your show. Apparently, parking in certain lots after certain times was included in the ticket price. Bike parking was also available for our show.Concessions - Some good beer/cocktail options can be found; however, it's mostly just miller/bud options. \u00a0 Food options are pretty limited, with the Robinson's truck being one of the better options. One of the nice features of this venue is that they let you bring in snack food, as well as factory sealed water. GA lawn - Unlike every other outdoor concert venue that has a sloping lawn, the lawn at First Merit is basically flat. If you are located in that portion of the venue, expect to watch the entire show on a monitor. In terms of sound on the lawn, the venue had this remark: \"While other artists have opted to use a single delay system, Phish is bringing in multiple delay towers to ensure optimal sound coverage across the entire lawn.\" So while Phish covered their fans, who knows how it sounds otherwise. Probably less than optimal.All-in-all, if you are not on the lawn and know the limitations of the venue, this venue is a decent option for seeing a show.

Our seats were incredibly amazing, way better than i thought they would be section 103 row J center, we were able to see them and the stage perfectly. Nick and I shared a moment when we looked into each others eyes. The little bit that BSB performed was incredible. That pretty much sums up the good things about the concert. Walking in we noticed the ATM and beer lines were ridiculous. The \"bathrooms\" were off to the side and were really just port a potty trailers, the stalls were super tiny, thank god they opened outwards otherwise i would have been stuck in the stall. There was only 1 merchandise stand and the credit card machines were down. The concert started way after it was scheduled. The security people were unnecessarily rude and not even paying attention when they needed to. We had to deal with 3 very rude seat hoppers, they kept going around section 103 trying to move up. Sorry but i paid a lot of money for my seats and its not fair for people to move up just because they want to, and at that be rude to the people that actually belonged there. The seats were cheap fold up chairs that were zip tied together, the rows were crazy narrow, and if you sat down you were practically on top of your neighbor. I had to sit with one 1 cheek in the air and the other on the seat. Then when the venue turned on the lights and we were told that it was over. Had the fold up chairs not been zip tied together, I would have started a riot. The venue people turned off the microphones on BSB and did not even let them say a proper goodbye. WTF is there a curfew ordinance on an ISLAND!? They started kicking us out with the guys still onstage. By the end of the night all the grass by the merchandise tent and bathrooms was soggy like it had been raining. I'd rather not know exactly what caused it.

I left about halfway through 311's show and on the way out saw people passed out in the green near the entry/exit with staff over looking them. Another person was passed out on a picnic table. I get it, people get drunk and stupid at concerts and as the venue owner/operator/manager you should be prepared for that and have perhaps a first aid section where these people can be taken and out of the general view of sober attendees.

The lawn could be more elevated and it was a tad bit crowded leaving the venue but overall I would see another show here in the lawn. \u00a0I'd like to see Dave at Alpine next year though just because of the tailgating experience and the fact that the lawn seats are better but go in with a plan.

Also after realizing that I've been wearing hats/beanies for the past couple weeks that I needed to do something, fast. So, I decided to get off my butt and ask the mighty internet for a place to go.I searched for \"Men's Haircut\" and the first thing that caught my eye was yelp.

She made sure I got the haircut I wanted and kept going back to make sure the details were perfect. Jen was also a great conversationalist and I was never once bored while getting my haircut.After the haircut I was taken to the back to get the hand wax treatment. I thought it was really cool since I'm easily amused and I got to have my hands covered in wax. She then took me to wash my hair and placed a hot towel on my face. The head massage was good and the \"stimulating\" conditioner gave my head this cool/tingly feeling on my scalp. Then came the hand massage. I don't know if it was the mixture of the head massage, conditioner, hot towel, and the hand massage but that was the most relaxed I've been in awhile. At the end, Jen offered me some styling tips and styled my hair. I was blown away by how great Jen was and the services. I will definitely be going back and in fact I've already referred a buddy of mine.I know a lot of people have been complaining/held back by the price but for all the services that the package offers compared to everywhere else, it really can't be beat.

From the calendar of shows, to the shuttle buses to concerts and record store upstairs, Reggies is a music lover's dream come true. With a diversity of performers featured almost every night of the week, there is pretty much something for everyone. Although the smallness of the venue is certainly a consideration, and in some cases a drawback, I prefer the intimate setup and the ability to drink in the sights and sounds, not only in terms of the music being played but also the people watching. The sightline from the bar to the stage was decent and it seemed an overall better perch from which to watch the action versus sitting at one of the tables or, worse, a booth in the corner.As far as the ambiance, I would characterize Reggies as rustic roadhouse. Vintage rock posters cover exposed brick walls, with weathered wood and battered old park benches enhancing the old-time patina. Modern touches include flat screen TVs and a selection of craft brews in addition to the selections on tap. I particularly enjoyed the day's drink special-$5 Maker's Mark-which put me in mind of Friday even on Monday evening. All of the patrons I saw were at home in this space, bound by a love of the band and brews.

Certainly, the cursory glance \u00a0doesn't warrant a separate review of this space, which has been a feature of Reggies for the past seven years. For a warm autumn night there was a decent-size crowd and this spot looked like more of a neighborhood hangout, with bar seating and a couple of flat screens.

We went there on a Friday night for some drinks and eats before catching the free shuttle bus to a concert. It was a school bus that was painted all funky, and was super fun. Haven't been on a school bus in ages-- felt like we were on the magic school bus. Becky was the server on the bus, super nice and fun girl, and offered us $5 beers which was convenient too.Ok. The bad. The reason this post is lacking the other 3 stars.Our server (the girl with the long dreads) provided us with the worst service I have ever experienced. When we sat at our table, we had to flag her down and ask her if we had enough time to eat before the shuttle bus leaves. Her response: \"I have no idea what time it is so I can't really tell you.\" Ok, maybe next time just say \"The kitchen takes about such and such time to make food so you want to order this much time in advance.\" Or, you could ask what time it is.We decided to order food-- had to flag her down once again. She came back to our table, never asked if we wanted anything to drink, didn't even offer water...We put our order in and about 15 mins later a food runner brought it to us. Had to ask the food runner for silverware, napkins and water. WE DIDN'T SEE OUR SERVER AGAIN UNTIL WE HAD TO FLAG HER DOWN FOR THE CHECK! Horrible... She didn't even come over to ask if our food came out alright or if there was anything else we needed.I have been a server myself and still tipped her 15% because I know FOH hospitality workers live off tips (usually I would do 20% or more but I really couldn't even possibly justify giving her more than 15%)So, ok, maybe she was having a bad day.

The drinks were watered down -- but at only $2 on Tuesday nights, who can rightfully complain? The wings are the real winner here, and I think they're only $4 on Tuesdays. Those wings were my only friend to get me through listening to a bad date talk about himself for 2 hours...Reggie's is not my \"go to\" South Loop spot, but if I ever get a hankering for those wings again, I'd definitely go there again.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 10, 29]}, "27": {"description": "I picked Reggie's rooftop a few weeks as a spot for a Friday happy hour with friends and family that happened to also be my birthday. I've been to Reggie's for shows and food on other occasions but this was my first experience on the roof top. The atmosphere of the roof top is great. It was super crowded when I first got there at 5-ish but the crowd thinned out to more comfortable levels as it got later (and colder). The roof top has plenty of tables, a full bar, and pool table and a pop-a-shot-game. Very relaxed atmosphere. The prices on all the food and drinks were reasonable and definitely met expectations. My dad had a catfish sandwich that tasted absolutely heavenly. Too bad the service is terrible. When I first arrived I went to the bar to grab a drink while I waited for the rest of my party. I overheard a woman sitting at the bar ask the bartender if he knew how to make a certain drink. He snapped \"no\" at her in response and walked away. When I finally ordered my drink I asked (with credit card in hand) if I could open a tab and he snapped \"no\" at me, tossed down the check and walked away. No explanation given. If its policy not to start a tab or he was going off shift then no big whoop but he was extremely rude. I chalked it up to one guy being snotty but \u00a0as my guests arrived the bad service stories started to pile up.- when one friend who didn't realize we were on the roof sat at the bar downstairs to wait she asked the female bartender what her best drink was, the bartender told her she could \"open a bottle of beer really well\" and stalked away. - a few people in my party ordered food at the bar...only \u00a0to not be told when it was ready. We were sitting at a table right in front of the bar and the server made NO EFFORT to inform them that their food was ready. After what seemed like a longer than reasonable wait they went to the bar to inquire and found their food sitting on the bar, ice cold. - my dad ordered our food from the waitress who made sporadic disinterested appearances from time to time. A few minutes after she delivered our food she came back around and put the bill on the table without a word. She came back around a few minutes later to tell us that she had left the bill on the table, as if she thought we were going to leave without paying it (we were there for at least another 3 hours after this). She also never asked if we wanted anything else (which we did, but had already ordered at the bar because we didn't think she was ever going to come back).- my aunt attempted to order food from the same waitress. My aunt told her what she wanted and then tried to get the attention of someone else in our party who had given up on waiting for the waitress and went to order at the bar. We told the waitress to go ahead and put in the order she had been given. About 30 minutes later we flag her down and inquire about the food only to be VERY snottily told that she didn't put in the order because it wasn't complete. Even is she thought that was the case, why wouldn't she come back around to get the rest of it? - When a friend noticed that someone had set out the little wood burning chimneys at the opposite end of the roof she flagged down the guy who had done it (i think he was security) and asked if we could have one too (it was COLD!!). He acted VERY out upon but eventually did it and made it a point to snap \"you good now?\" once he was done. \u00a0So that completed the circle of EVERY employee we interacted with being unnecessarily rude. Normally this level of bad service would have had me steaming mad but I did my best to let it go at the time because it was my birthday. But I can't ever see myself returning to any part of Reggie's after the shoddy treatment my party received. Its a shame because the rooftop is beautiful and most things about it are great. I understand that Reggie's is a \"rock\" atmosphere but they should probably invest in some staff training. You can still be a \"bad ass\" and not treat your paying customers like garbage.

Just be careful if you're not the best shot, the hoop basically overlooks the side of the building! Parking was pretty easy to find.-Food that I got was pretty good. I got the chorizo burger (1/2 off burgers on Thursdays when you buy a drink). The chorizo patty was flavorful and a great surprise. The burger came with a side of a peppery sauce, which by itself doesn't have much taste but goes well with the flavorful chorizo. Fries were very tasty with the burger. The only let down was that egg I got with the burger was overcooked. There are other daily food specials and I'll definitely try some of those.-Service was good. It wasn't too busy when I went with a group of 5 but the waitress was quick and responsive.

YUM. I know the Polish pizza made many believers on our tour group (2 people said \"I hate sauerkraut, but this pizza changed my mind!\"), but I'm not a huge kielbasa fan, and this had thick pieces on it, so it wasn't my favorite. The white pizza was different than expected. I guess when I hear the word \"white sauce\" I think of crappy alfredo from Olive Garden, but this was a nice feta sauce that had great flavor. The roasted brussel sprouts were thick pieces and also pretty good, but I think my pizza brain couldn't wrap its head around the concept of a brussel sprout pizza, so I didn't end up eating the whole piece. The restaurant is long and narrow, and remained crowded the whole time we were there. There's an outdoor patio area which turned into a heated tent area for the winter. We were forced to sit out there since our tour group had 17 people in it, and the owner/manager felt bad, since it was cold. He came out with a Polish vodka and gave us all shots to warm us up!

Sauce is a very smooth blend non-sweet with the right amount that the cheese still holds together with crust, making it very easy to eat with little mess. They don't skimp on the cheese either. I find that many pizza places throw all the cheese in the center and you end up with this dry crusty area on the outside; not here. You can tell they put time into crafting their pizza that every slice is as good as the last. I ordered pepperoni and sausage on mine. Pepperoni and sausage were cooked under the cheese, which I prefer, because it adds an extra element to the sauce as it cooks. You cannot go wrong with Flo and Santos.

I know the Polish pizza made many believers on our tour group (2 people said \"I hate sauerkraut, but this pizza changed my mind!\"), but I'm not a huge kielbasa fan, and this had thick pieces on it, so it wasn't my favorite.

The roasted brussel sprouts were thick pieces and also pretty good, but I think my pizza brain couldn't wrap its head around the concept of a brussel sprout pizza, so I didn't end up eating the whole piece. The restaurant is long and narrow, and remained crowded the whole time we were there. There's an outdoor patio area which turned into a heated tent area for the winter. We were forced to sit out there since our tour group had 17 people in it, and the owner/manager felt bad, since it was cold. He came out with a Polish vodka and gave us all shots to warm us up!

I mean, I may not be a big fan of football, but I am a big fan of food. I had brought my mom along for this city adventure so she accompanied me for the meal.Kroll's had Goose Island on special for $3 so we indulged in a few of those. After browsing the menu we decided to each start with a bowl of their chicken dumpling soup since it's one of their specialties (and it was a pretty chilly day). Our waitress asked if we wanted to upgrade from a cup to a bowl for only 50 cents... Well sure! The bowl was actually the perfect amount. It looked like a lot more than it was, because the bowl was really shallow. They definitely make a mean chicken dumpling soup though. Boy was it good!The soup ended up being pretty filling, so my mom and I decided to split the three cheese grilled cheese ($8.50) with added pork belly (and extra $2.50). This creamy blend of sharp American, mozzarella, and gouda cheese melted perfectly onto a crusty rustic bread. Yum! As our side we went with the tater tots. Of course our waitress asked if we wanted to upgrade to loaded tots and at this point, hell... why not! The tots were good, but I wasn't totally loving the melted cheese on them. The bacon pieces were a nice touch though. Service was great and our waitress was really nice. The only bummer was that she forgot my ranch.

When I look back I wish I had been properly trained. But it's time to pass my dreams on to my little one!Every day of my life is like living in a musical. When my little one was a baby I sang all the time. Well it rubbed off and now our life is a musical. We love to just to do some humorous improve family singing...which always seems to include the word poop! It's funny for the kids but my old improv coach would be mad because he said stay away from potty humor and poop belongs in the potty. We decided to take some of that creativity and give it some formal training. This is our place. The front desk and staff are really friendly. I wish the rooms weren't sound proof because as a parent sitting in the hallway I would love to hear the kids singing. The facility here is really nice. I also love all of the free musical shows they have posted. I guess I know what I'm doing for the rest of the summer. The other day my little one started singing a song and I jumped in and sang the next line. My wife looked at me and said, \"I've never heard that song! How do you know it?\" I looked at here and said its from the musical, \"You're a Good Man Charlie Brown!\" And I sang it on stage. I haven't heard that song in 26 years and as my little one sang it I remembered all the lyrics. \u00a0It was so surreal. This is the current song my little on is learning.

There's comfortable couches and chairs as well as seats along the bar. It's a great place to have drinks with your GF/BF/friends/colleagues. Whether it's crowded or not, the staff and patrons are always friendly. No meat market or creepers here! It's mainly a nice professional Black crowd of both singles and couples ages 30-60, but any race/age would definitely feel comfortable and have a good time. The dress code of the patrons is typically business/smart casual or trendy. For the gents, jeans with a nice jacket/sweater/collared shirt is fine. For the ladies, jeans with a cute top and heels is perfect. Those wearing 3 piece head gear (doo rag, head band & baseball hat), white t's, sagging pants or hoochie mama dresses with hooker heels should keep it moving past 1520 Wabash. M Lounge is also a great place to celebrate your special ocassion. I actually celebrated my birthday there twice. Drink prices are comparable to other more upscale drinking establishments. This is not a \"bar\" or a \"club\". This is a lounge. If you are looking for a $2 PBR, jello shots or a $5 glass of box wine, M Lounge is not your place. I usually get Macallan 12 or 18.

He's been \"in the house\" almost every time I've been here, and he truly cares about making sure his guests have a good time, and he's thoughtful about how he can improve their experience in the future. In fact, he once followed a friend and me out the door to ask us about our experience, what we liked and what could use improvement. Wow! I love when owners of restaurants & bars greet the tables, but this went well beyond that. Trilion is equally hospitable behind the bar, suggesting and crafting high-quality cocktails.

Most recently, I saw Tracye Eileen, and her sultry voice made me fall in love with her at first sound. She rocked, romanced and soothed the room with her R&B and jazz, both up-tempo and ballads.

We purchased tickets to their New Year's party/event with a few friends, thinking it would be a great option as they are close to home (no crazy Uber surcharges!) and we liked their food.When we arrived, the tables hadn't been arranged any differently, and it was quite quiet, so it felt like we were just hanging out in a restaurant. Seeing as it IS a restaurant, that wouldn't be weird, but it was New Year's Eve! We were hoping for something more festive than ordering drinks while seated at a table in the corner.The drink menu was limited, which was not advertised but was fine, as everything on there was more or less tasty and good quality. Our opinions really shifted though, when we asked if we could order a small appetizer (sidenote: there were two options: $75 for open bar, or $125 for 4-course meal and open bar - we chose the former). The waitress told us that they only made food for the 4-course package and we couldn't order anything - just drinks. Welp. I'm sure if we had asked management, they likely would have changed their tune, however we didn't bother. I was just surprised that they had no issue with denying someone food - pre-prepared hummus no less! - who plans on drinking $75 worth of booze.In terms of ambience, they didn't dim the lights (we even asked), which sucks, but they had a belly dancer who was lovely and a very nice jazz trio. If the glaring lights had been adjusted, I think it would have felt much cozier and more festive, but that wasn't a huge dealbreaker.The kicker was when we realized it was 11:56 and champagne hadn't yet been passed out. When we asked the waitress, she said it was coming. I walked down at 11:59, tired of waiting, and she shrugged and told me I could just grab a few from the bar. So I trudged back up the stairs with 3 glasses for 4 people as the restaurant patrons were halphazardly counting down (the restaurant didn't do anything for the countdown).My companions and I cheersed a minute late, quickly drank our champagne (which, to their credit, was very good), and remitted to boozing for two more hours.While their food is quite good (I've eaten here before), I would not recommend ever attending a special event here. The staff was not apologetic at all (I even said something about the toast to a manager, and got a \"Yeah, it's our first one and we weren't quite prepared\" - but no apology) and we left feeling like we had wasted money and the evening.I like this place overall and it's close to home, but I am torn on whether I want to return or not after dropping $75 on a total flop of an evening.To Kurah: I would suggest either skipping out next year, or seriously re-thinking your execution and advertisement of this event.", "rating": "1", "date": [2016, 1, 5]}, "18": {"description": "I've been here a few times.

Tours are focused on the players, what their lives were like, and their legacy in American song. The old recording rooms are bare, sound boards probably carted away when Chess moved down the street, but are filled now with a collection of memorabilia. The gear may be gone, but the walls remain, and thankfully we have the Dixon family there to guide us and share stories they heard passed around their home. Blues Heaven Foundation also supports blues artists, providing both performance space in their outdoor theater, as well as financial assistance for musicians struggling with care.Thank the Dixon family for saving this shrine to all that was ever great about music and its ability to connect with people. Michigan Avenue was once known as \"record row\" with dozens of small labels competing for artists.
