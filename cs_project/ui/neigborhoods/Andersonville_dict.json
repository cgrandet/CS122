The waiter offered us a complimentary house soup, chicken and noodles in a savory vegetable broth, which was much appreciated. The margaritas are huge, tasty, and made with big pieces of tasty fruit. I ordered the Costillas en Salsa Verde. I liked it but didn't love it (read about it below if interested). My wife got the taco dinner; she liked. The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the restaurant and bar are attractive. I would definitely come back. Long explanation of my thoughts on the costillas that you can skip without hurting my feelings:As the name says, it's ribs in a green sauce, served with tortillas and rice and beans on the side. Honestly, I don't really get this dish. There seems to be way more sauce than there is meat. But it doesn't lack meat. There's just a ton of sauce. Since it's served with tortillas, I ate it with tortillas but honestly I don't think a tortilla with a ton of sauce and a little meat brings much to the flavor game. And since it's supposed to end up in a tortilla anyways it makes me wonder why the meat is left on the bone anyways, because it's kind of burden cutting meat off ribs when you can't see where the bones are because, again, it's covered in sauce. And it's kind of hard to say how exactly the meat tastes because, again, it's covered in sauce, but the meat was tender enough. And this isn't really a complaint about the restaurant, because it was indeed ribs in green salsa competently prepared with quality ingredients. And the sauce was actually super tasty. And I know I'm doing a lot of complaining here, but I did like the dish; I just didn't love it.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 10, 15]}, "11": {"description": "WOW!

If you are looking for some particular type of European pastry in Chicago, this is probably the place to start. On my last visit, I tried both their version of the Swedish \"semla\" and the Polish equivalent, the \"paczki\". The semla was good, but unfortunately, it did not contain enough almond creme for my taste. It was also served in a strange paper cup. This is not the traditional way of serving a semla. Nonetheless, the semla would still be slightly above average compared to the ones you can find in Sweden.Where the Swedish Bakery really shines is with regards to the cookies. They sell a large number of traditional Swedish cookies by the pound. In many other places, these kinds of cookies are often quite dry and uninspiring. I am happy to report that this is not the case here! I tried about 7 different varieties, and all were very well made. The butter-to-sugar ratio was just right. As some other reviewers have noted, many of their products contain, or rather, consist of, marzipan. This may seem unappealing to many American consumers. But keep in mind that marzipan is to Europeans as peanut butter is to Americans. They put it on essentially everything! In addition, Scandinavian pastries are often less sweet than the American counterparts. As a result, you will not find many of the \"large-size, extra cream, extra fudge\" kind of treats that you might be used to.

She did an amazing corrective color and tone with highlights. However, my experience with having my roots bleached was painful, prolonged, and with unsatisfactory results. This was especially disappointing as their site states the salon's specialty is hair color. The developer used on my scalp was too strong (in my untrained opinion, based on some light internet research--she used 30%; I read you shouldn't use more than 20% on the scalp--on top of that, I have uber-sensitive skin), and it was left on way too long, and without any heat to activate (speed up) the treatment. It itched and burned like motherf----. Then my roots still ended up darker than the rest of my hair, and my scalp burned for the rest of the night. I wasn't able to come back till 2 weeks later, when she was more than willing to correct it at no charge. (Very sweet girl, btw).I insisted she use a weaker solution, but she wasn't comfortable doing that--I think she was afraid she'd have to leave it on longer and it would burn me. She did agree to use heat though (which helped a lot). She also used a different brand which didn't burn nearly as much. However, bc my roots were already blonde, this time they turned out too light. Gah!! Shoulda just gone with the 20% like I asked...Anyway, I would have given five stars if not for the bleach/roots issues. Alexandra is very talented and personable. I think the third time she would get it perfect and become my go-to colorist. However, I just moved to the northern burbs.The salon:As for the salon, it is very small and quiet, which I actually prefer. You'll need to make an appointment bc of the size, but I had no trouble getting one either time. The service chairs are seriously uncomfortable--expect your ass to fall asleep. The cushion feels like it's going to fall out of the chair bc of a gap behind it, lol. They have no receptionist, so your stylist may have to stop and answer the phone. They do not accept credit cards, but there is an ATM a block away. The prices are more than reasonable; they're a steal--they really should charge more and put the money back into the salon, as it could use some upgrades.

Although no one stopped me on Lincoln Avenue afterwards and demanded to know who did the work, no one screamed and jumped underneath a bus to get away either.The salon itself is quiet. When I arrived today, Aida was reading a magazine and waiting for me. She greeted me like an old friend, even though we have only met once before, and got started mixing the color right away. I trust these girls enough that I did not inquire about the color. She actually chose two different shades of blonde today, without asking me, but you know what? She chose correctly. It is a little bit blonder than I have had recently, but it looks good. So, point for Aida; she knows her products and her clients.There were no other clients while I was there, but the phone did ring quite a bit. They don't have a receptionist. Aida stopped a few times to answer the phone, but she finally just let it go into voice mail. That was a good choice.The whole treatment took 2 hours. The total cost was $75.00. I reflected on all the times in past years, when I had employment that actually paid me real cash money, and when I spent a fair amount of that money getting my hair done at Elizabeth Arden Spa on Michigan Avenue. I spent something like $200 each time, including all the tips. And you know what? I am just as happy with the work I get at Bello, and I am rocking with joy when I contemplate the reasonable prices.

Plus it's wildly overpriced for what it is. We had an order of gyoza too. Just OK. Nothing special. Their Thai food is really mediocre too. I wish to sh*t this place was good since we live so close, I'd love it to be a regular spot for us but the food is bad, below mediocre and not fresh. The wait service is extremely lacking too. As in inattentive and not available. When someone finally showed up to notice I'd eaten almost none of my sushi and asked me why they argued with me about it. \"We make rolls fresh everyday.\" I would hope you f*cking do. I'm not implying you roll these maki days in advance (although maybe they do, came out faster than a mcdouble at McDonalds). I'm implying the contents within are of very low quality. Your crummy fish is bad and has been sitting in saran wrap for God knows how long. Waitress made absolutely no apology or attempt at a concession. In the end our bill was $40. Christ what a waste. Nothing like feeling taken advantage of. Lastly the restaurant was filled with flies and fruit flies. Disgusting.I'm never coming back.

We had high hopes for this place based on a few of the rave reviews here. We were disappointed. The crab rangoons are oddly sweet. The sprig rolls don't come as a roll but rather like a sliced and arranged sushi roll. The rice paper wrap is opaque and the entire dish has no flavor at all, save the bits lucky enough to have a thin slice of jalape\u00f1o on top. My boyfriend got the Chef's Choice sushi set which came with the most basic assortment of fish imaginable. It appears the chef doesn't want to make choices here. The last piece he ate had a terrible taste--a bummer to end on. I had the chicken Pad Thai, assuming that it should be something they would do well. I was wrong. The dish, like the others, was so utterly devoid of flavor that it was inedible and I went to hunt down a shot glass of hot pepper sauce. I've had great Pad Thai and the bland disaster I was served at Polygon left me wondering if the chef here has ever tasted Thai food. Adding insult to injury, the bill was $47. Never again!

Originally it's $200, but the Groupon was for $99. \u00a0Koval is very close to the Ravenswood Metra but about a mile from the Berwyn red.Craft distillery, craft breweries, arts and crafts, kraft mac and cheese...they're all so hot right now. But really, if you haven't noticed the overwhelming number of craft beers available, you must one of those people who shotguns Natty Light in the shower. \u00a0Anyway, Koval is a craft distillery and an awesome one at that. You have to ring the doorbell when you get there, but I was checked in really quickly. \u00a0I was early, so I just sat in their front room/store looking a their spirits selection. Once everyone else came we were led to some tables in the back, where Robert, the owner, started off our workshop. \u00a0He gives a presentation, and you can follow along on the packet you receive. \u00a0Learning the history, the process, etc. was great. \u00a0Let's talk about the best part though - the whiskey tastings. We started off with the white whiskeys, and Koval's was way better than the other one we tasted. \u00a0Then we got to taste the \"heads\" and the \"tails.\" \u00a0The heads are the compounds that distill along with the alcohol at a lower temperature (like acetaldehyde...yeah I'm a nerd and am into the organic chemistry, too), and the tails (fusel oils) are from a higher temperature. \u00a0They were both not very pleasant, and you'd never realize that's what you were tasting when drinking some whiskeys. \u00a0There's a cup on the tables to pour out excess whiskey if you don't want to finish it, which we only did for the bad tasting things.At each part in the presentation, Robert had some relevant whiskeys for us to taste. \u00a0We tried at least 20 brands of various whiskey types. From looking at the difference in color or tasting the difference between whiskeys aged in toasted barrels vs charred barrels to blended whiskeys to sour mash vs bourbon, it was a lot. \u00a0You don't get a full shot for the tastings, but maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of a shot. \u00a0Of course I wish it was more, but otherwise everyone would be extremely drunk by the time it's over. \u00a0Koval's whiskeys are all distilled from 100% of one grain, while many use a mix, so learning what those grains taste like was pretty cool and delicious.I learned a lot - more than I realized until I was thinking about this review. \u00a0I tasted a lot, but I kind of wish we had talked more about tasting whiskey rather than just asking, \"What did you guys think of that one?\" Most of the answers were positive, because, we all clearly liked to drink whiskey. Although some girls seemed to be there because they were with their significant other, and they didn't really know much about whiskey. Not to hate on them, because it actually is a good learning experience no matter your knowledge level. \u00a0You can ask Robert almost anything including, \"Uhhh so can we try that one?\" \u00a0It was definitely more interesting than 90% of the classes I've taken. Overall a good experience that has made me more discerning about the whiskeys I drink. \u00a0By the end, we were all at least buzzed and joked around a lot. \u00a0The Groupon was a good deal for what you get and was a great birthday present for me.

Fun fact learned on the tour: the pictures on the labels of the liqueurs were done by the owner's mother.As for the tastings, we tried the white whiskey, the dark whiskey, and a bunch of the liqueurs - rose hip, walnut, coffee, orange blossom, and more. We learned that some of their liqueurs are seasonal (like the Asian pear that they won't be making this year due to a failed crop), and some are definitely off the beaten path (like the liqueur made from failed beer from their next door neighbors, Revolution Brewing). I thought it was fun that with each liqueur, suggestions for specialty cocktails were offered, some I wouldn't think of on my own.

My tour had about 30 people on it and with just one person working (reception / tour guide / I'm sure many other duties), when people came late, it meant she kept having to stop to let them in & check them in. The tour itself is quite informative, prob just 30-45 minutes long. I've been on a couple of distillery tours before and still picked up some new information.Throughout the tour, you get samples of each liquor available. The sample, mind you, is a quick pour, each pour equal to just about 1/8 of a shot. So when all is said and done, you've maybe had what equates to one shot though I think it's even less than that. One reviewer said they got as many samples as they liked at the end, not the case for our group.I loved the dessert liquors we sampled - orange blossom & rose hip - yum, yum, yum!

I cannot remember her name. She was it,, There were multiple people already waiting for the tour to commence. I had inquired about the Bourbon and was informed there was only one bottle left. I quickly secured the bottle and paid $52.99. Lovely girl started the tour and we all shuffled into the room closer to the equipment where she could explain how it all works. This was fine and good but her delivery came across as a little bored and rote... No humor at all..there were multiple samples of all the product but not the bourbon.All samples were two sips at the most. I have since discovered that I can buy the very same bottle of bourbon at Binnys for $49.99 and at Mariano's for $44.99. Lesson learned. Do your research before hand..

Late-comers were allowed to join the group (Mallory clearly found it annoying to answer the door to get these people), but none of the tour was made up for their sake.During the tour, we tasted 4 whiskeys and 2 liqueurs, each of which we received a very small sample (on the order of a few milliliters). Products not shown during the tour were not available to sample afterward. There was no pressure to purchase KOVAL's products. The samples were integrated into the tour fluidly; I especially liked the head/heart/tail samples. As a chemist, I can say that the scientific details were presented well enough for a lay person. Since I have some deeper knowledge, I can say that some parts of the tour weren't quite true if taken at face value. Compared to the tour of FEW in Evanston, KOVAL's tour was much more polished and catered to a general audience. FEW's tour was given by the distillers themselves (it was unclear if our tour guide was involved in the production of KOVAL's products) and tended to be more technical and detailed.TL;DR?

I am perfectly happy with my eyebrows the way they are, so I said, \"I don't need the eyebrows done.\" He loudly snorted, rolled his eyes, and said, \"OK, if you say so.\"Then--again without asking or even warning me--he slathered my hair with probably half a bottle of gel and gave me a truly ridiculous pompadour type thing.

Here's why:1. Excellent, friendly, speedy service. We never wait long for our appetizers, and the main dishes arrive on time and still fresh and hot. Even when they are busy.2. The AMAZING flavor of everything on the menu. We have tried too many dishes to name (most of which can be made vegetarian, which we really appreciate), and every one of them, no exception, has been out of this world. Just bursting with flavor but subtle enough not to overpower the palate. Not easy when you're dealing with kimchi and peppers, but these chefs know how to make Korean food right. Super impressive dishes, every one. Although our favorites are the Kimchi Pancake and the vegetarian Jab chae--you just can't go wrong if you order those.3. The atmosphere. It's a calming, dark, intimate setting for a date or a party. Not too loud, but not unnervingly quiet. My new hubby and I just had a private party here, and the service and execution of the entire 3 hours was far more than we expected. Everyone in our party proclaimed the food \"amazing\" and that they would be back. I love being able to introduce Jin Ju to people because (1) I know they will come back, and (2) this restaurant deserves to live long and prosper as one of the best in Chicago.

We ordered them steamed, not fried and they were wonderful. I enjoyed every bite. For dinner, I ordered the Bi Bim Bap. It came steaming in a hot stone pot and I luxuriated in every bite. It was so good! Why did it take me so long to go Korean? The spicy red pepper paste sauce made my eyes water and my nose run......it was fiery and delicious. My friend ordered the Bulgogi.

People in the restaurant were mostly young professional hipsters, mostly in groups of 2-5. The slim, 2-sided menu offered various options. They offered many appetizers including mandoo (dumplings), pajun (thin scallion pancakes), and tegim. We tried the hemul pajun, which was very fresh, simple, and delicious.

Jin Ju choose beef, roasted red peppers, sesame seed oil, spinach, Shiitake mushrooms, and carrots. It was a truly wonderful and well thought out dish. My one complaints is that it wasn't quite flavorful enough. My experience with Chap Chea from other Korean restaurants is that it's a spicy option. Jin Ju made a very tasty entree that I felt could have had a little more kick. But, if spicy isn't your think, then I definitely recommend this item.My fianc\u00e9 ordered the O Jinga Bokum.

Tabouli, wrong ratio of parsley to bulgur wheat. And the same hard unripe tomatoes and unpeeled cucumber as everywhere else.

I have seen chiropractors for over 15 years, and even planned to become one, back in the day. \u00a0One of my closest friends was a chiropractor so I was sold. \u00a0For years, I would come into chiropractic clinics in pain, I'd get my immediate adjustment, and would leave feeling better, only to return a week to two weeks later when the pain returned. I was passively involved in my improvement, and I never really knew the cause of the chronic lower back pain and depression, which has been a struggle for over 22 years. I thought of the spine as a static structure that I had no responsibility for and the depression as an inescapable family trait. \u00a0All I thought I needed was a doctor's tweak on a stubborn vertebrae every so often, and all would be well. \u00a0I was ok with that plan....UNTIL IN LEARNED THAT MORE WAS POSSIBLE!!!At Dr. Mark's clinic, I actually got x-rays of my spine so that we could see what was going on inside. \u00a0It was only because of these x-rays that we discovered I had mild scoliosis in my lumbar spine. \u00a0WTF? \u00a0I saw the films myself and was shocked. \u00a0Back story: I teach a form of movement education that is all about spine-health and posture, so I am the last person in the world who should have anything wrong with his spine. \u00a0But, voila, the x-rays and thoroughness of testing and palpation of Dr. Mark made clear for the first time, the probable cause of my back pain and that has literally altered the course of my treatment into ACTUAL WELLNESS! \u00a0I just got new films after several months of consistent treatments with Dr. Mark, and for the first time in my adult life, I am consistently pain free, AND, my lumbar spine is improving. \u00a0The lateral curve is almost gone and the twist is barely noticeable. \u00a0I would consider this a flipping MIRACLE. On another note.....Dr. Mark mentioned that adjustments to the angle of my C1 vertebrae (which was not in its ideal carriage), might result in an improvement in my mental health. \u00a0I was entirely skeptical at first, but after 1 month of cervical adjustments, I started to notice that I had more access to joy, which would last, sometimes, through an entire day. \u00a0I also noticed that I was far less anxious in crowded environments. \u00a0Now THAT'S crazy!!! \u00a0This was a benefit I did not expect, and I look forward to continuing to improve that area of health with my continued treatment plan at ChiroOne! \u00a0There is not a day I leave Dr. Mark's clinic feeling anything but more educated and moving forward in my overall health. \u00a0In short (ha ha), I walked in with \"fast food chiropractic\" expectations, and what I got was something FAR greater and more beneficial to my long-term health. \u00a0Dr. Mark is a first rate D.C. and he is one of the most thorough chiropractors I've experienced. \u00a0I never feel like he's in a rush to get me adjusted and out. \u00a0He manages his time well enough that he can take time with me when I have a special concern or question. \u00a0I really value a doctor who makes me feel like I matter. \u00a0Long winded.....but I had to share with anyone who may be on the fence or are curious about chiropractic. \u00a0Dr. Mark is the bomb!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 3]}, "17": {"description": "First off: No Chiropractor at Chiro One is a DOCTOR! They should correct every person who calls one of the adjusters a DR. It is misleading and inappropriate for anyone who received their degree from the \"Cleveland Chiropratic school of LA\" WHAT?! They do not go to medical school and are NOT doctors.Secondly: Chiro One is set up as a \"cult\". You MUST drink the \"cool aid\". You must commit. You must suspend any disbelief. Third: You CANNOT regenerate cartilage! So, the most that anyone with a degenerative condition, which produced or produces cartilage damage will NEVER be cured! Regardless, of whatever treatment program Chiro One tries to put you on there will always be pain. It just has to be managed the best way possible. In other words, the cult (Chiro One) wants you to believe that \"if you have pain, you will be sick\", and that they can EVENTUALLY cure your pain through continued treatments! That is Reverend \"Jim Jones\" talk! Don't drink the cool aid!....which brings me to my main point. I went to Chiro One because I wanted to see a Chiropractitioner, and I felt that the stretching and moderate workout would be a good way to start my day. After the first adjustment I felt GREAT. The \"slipped disk\" or whatever was repositioned. However, every adjustment after that was painful and a set-back. On many occasions, I could not make it in for an adjustment. Weeks would go by, and I felt perfectly fine. ...but then I would return for an adjustment. It would hurt and I would suffer lower back pain again. I spoke with the adjuster many times, who always told me that \"sometimes the process of healing was painful\" (paraphrase). On my last adjustment, I was feeling fine, no lower back pain at all. The adjuster (Dr. Mark) chastised me for not coming in 2-3 times a week, and because I was not there for two weeks. He hurt me during the adjustment that took place, while he was telling me \"I should have dropped you from the program\". It has taken me over three weeks to recover. I now feel good again, and will NEVER return.I wrote a negative review on the evaluation report and spoke to a person at the front desk who told me that I could fill out a form to have my upfront payment remaining balance refunded. I was skeptical because I had signed forms saying that, if I stop treatment my remaining money may not be returned, but I filled out the form, including a 2nd negative review, and stopped treatment.Three weeks later, I received a letter stating that I paid $500 (CASH) for 24 treatments but that I actually received over $3000.00 in \"services\", so none of my money will be refunded. That is like trying to return an item that you bought for $50, and being told that you received \"service\" from your cashier for over the purchase price, so you can't have a refund. In other words, Chiro One has NO right to claim that, even though I didn't pay $3k, I should have been charged 3K. I will to try and get my \"records\" from Chiro One but expect that they will NOT turn them over to me. If they do, they will not contain my complaint(s).I knew Chiro One was a scam from the start, but I wanted to see a Chiropractor to relieve my back pain, and get my blood flowing in the morning by stretching and doing some stair stepping. They helped me initially, but eventually the adjustments hurt, caused pain, and caused lower back pain that would last for weeks. I was not able to keep appointments because of work, and because I was feeling great. After suffering through painful adjustments and the aftermath, I really tried to make it in at least once a week.

He was great. When he finished, I was stunned. This is the best cut I have had in years (even though I've been a regular at several high-end salons).

It's a beautiful shop, the music was a blend of great mellow trip hop, and everyone was exceedingly friendly. I also fell in love with the Moroccan Oil treatment Jim used.

More layers, he suggested.After a quick lather and rinse by another employee, Ken was at work, taking his time with my hair while making me feel completely comfortable and confident. I even learned that Ken has been cutting hair since age 12 when the neighborhood kids would turn to him for 5 buck cuts. The man found his calling early in life, and it shows. It is so reassuring to sit in the chair of a stylist who you know cares about what he's doing and will do it really well.I left the salon completely thrilled with my cut. Ken's work on my layers lightened my step up, and I've felt more confident in my look since. My only itsy-bitsy complaint would be that during my shampoo, there was no towel underneath my neck so the sink painfully dug into the top of my spine, and I wasn't given any robe, so my clothes got a bit splashed.

Because of formaldehyde concerns, this salon never jumped on the trendy Brazilian keratin treatments. So, I opted for a straight perm. The salon owner did the perms. The first time, she messed up the order of the treatment applications. Instead of lying about it, she apologized profusely and called customer service to find out if anything bad would happen from the mistake. Nothing bad happened, we rescheduled and she came in on her day off and straightened my hair free of charge. That perm turned out well.

Usually its an annual event, so I appreciate a haircut that looks good at the beginning, and continues to look good while it grows out. Last summer, after listening to much complaining about the state of my hair, my boyfriend bought me a haircut for my birthday - at any place I wanted to go. I looked on Yelp (it usually sends me in the right direction) and found this place, and two hours later I was sat in the chair while Don fixed the mess on my head. Can I write a review for Don, and give him 5 stars?? He was awesome. Even my boyfriend was impressed (and he's the kind of boyfriend who takes two weeks to notice that I dyed my hair a completely different color). It was possibly the best haircut I've ever had.So a year later, when it was time for my annual haircut, I naturally thought of this place again. This time, unfortunately, Don wasn't working on the day I went in. I had a pretty clear idea of the haircut I wanted, but the hairdresser who looked after me talked me out of it. I'm all for being talked out of a haircut - seriously, if someone who does this every day has a better idea, I'm all for it. Unfortunately the idea was not better than mine. Last time I had that haircut, I was nine. And my mother did it. I was not a happy camper. At all. (This, alone, is the reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars)Since I didn't have the time, or money (its a little more than I would usually pay), to go back and get it fixed, I waited for it to grow out. After two months or so it still wasn't any better, so I called and checked Don was working, and, since he was, I sucked it up and booked another appointment. What can I say? I will be going back to Don for my annual haircut next year. My hair looks great!! And Don was, once again, lovely. He gave me all sorts of good advice (both times) about how to look after my hair, and how to style it.Overall, this place is good, its just a shame that (in my experience) its so hit or miss.

I explained to Ken that I wanted to keep my basic look--long and straight--but somehow add some oomph. More layers, he suggested.After a quick lather and rinse by another employee, Ken was at work, taking his time with my hair while making me feel completely comfortable and confident. I even learned that Ken has been cutting hair since age 12 when the neighborhood kids would turn to him for 5 buck cuts. The man found his calling early in life, and it shows. It is so reassuring to sit in the chair of a stylist who you know cares about what he's doing and will do it really well.I left the salon completely thrilled with my cut. Ken's work on my layers lightened my step up, and I've felt more confident in my look since. My only itsy-bitsy complaint would be that during my shampoo, there was no towel underneath my neck so the sink painfully dug into the top of my spine, and I wasn't given any robe, so my clothes got a bit splashed.

This allows more space and easier to view the show. They've added some cushy chairs. Seating is always 1st come, 1st served.Plays are put on by local performers. For a small venue, it's a good, cheap enjoyable evening. We saw Christmas Dearest. Hilarious!

Apparently my father's girlfriend took him here for a date and he thought I'd like the ambiance and staff. Not sure what that's supposed to mean entirely, but nonetheless I was happy to agree when he took me here to try it for myself. The place is impossible to miss, as it's on the corner and decked out in bright purple. It starts out fun before you even set foot in the door. We got lucky and found a parking spot right nearby without a wait. We were seated right away too, and both our hostess and our server were friendly and attentive. The decor is fun and bright, with lots of different colors, kitsch, and wall hangings. There's a lot to look at while you're waiting for your food. There's also patio seating (seasonally) and a bar with chairs as well, if you don't want to be in the dining room. There's also fun music playing, which adds to the charm of the place.Then there's the food. My dad got a Meaty Mushroom burger which is topped with Swiss and a trio of mushrooms, and since he's a man of few words, it was \"good.\" I got the Daddy Mac burger, which came topped with beer-cheese mac. It's beer, cheese, noodles, and beef, what's not to love? Both burgers were well cooked and tasty. We also both got seasoned fries. Each of these burgers was somewhere in the $13 ballpark. We got a few drinks and dessert as well. He got a glass of wine and I got a \"Pretty in Pink\", which is raspberry vodka, raspberry liq, lemonade & sour. I'd order it again. One of the times I was there, I had a fried peanut butter and jelly, but it doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore, sadly (at least online). I settled for a honey-vanilla milkshake, which I think was $6 or so dollars. It was super creamy and the perfect sweet treat. We got our bill in a high heeled shoe, which was a fun little way to end the meal. This place is worth checking out if you're in the area, if you want a good burger and a fun atmosphere.

Do we want another? Yeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!I went with the piccante (spicy rapini, smoked mozzarella, pine nuts, calabrian chilli vinaigrette).First the bad - the stuffed zucchini flower for $10 consisted of 2 pieces. One was smaller than my thumb, and I have dainty hands. The other was about the size of my dainty handed thumb. \u00a0Was it good? Yes. But I took the smaller of the two because I'm nice to my husband, and I honestly don't even feel it was a full bite. So we were disappointed.Now the good - the pizza is fantastic!

We sampled their meatballs, which were a mix of beef and pork, served with a light marinara sauce; they were delicious! We followed with roasted beet and arugula salad and a terrine of wood fired cauliflower with parmesan cheese, both were perfect. We split their wood fired seared Scottish salmon entree, served with arugula, asparagus and shitake mushrooms. What can I say? The salmon was seared to perfection, seasoned perfectly, while still moist. Along the way I had a glass of valpolicella Ripaso, Tomassi Veneto - it was like drinking red velvet.

They should not be the size of my thumbnail and/or be translucent and stringy. Don't bother with them. Canned oysters at Mariano's would do you better. #2 Goat cheese truffle. We misread. We thought it was to be goat cheese in truffle oil. So we were disappointed when three balls of cheese showed up. The crustini was tasty, but the cheese was hard and too cold. #3 Dates wrapped in bacon with gorgonzola cheese. I make these, so I know how they should be. They, like the oysters, were made for the Oompa Loompas or Mini Me. So small, you hardly got any taste. They were, however, drenched in enough grease to give me an oil change.#4 Special whitefish with spinach and fingerling potatoes. Soggy, soggy, soggy. Again, swimming (haha...see what I did there...whitefish, swimming) in oils and butter. We did each get two glasses of wine that were great. Our bill was 85 bucks without tip.

I had been to restaurants in this area before and loved them. I've just come to assume that anything along this strip would be fantastic. At Bar Ombra, not so much. I also feel like the layout of the menu was even a little disorganized but maybe there is some kind of logic involved that I don't understand. I definitely brought my appetite, and I am fully aware of what it means to be hungry.Go for any of the items under the Cicchetti section. I think the restaurant likes to invest more of their time in these tiny little dishes resembling tapas. I cannot deny the irony there, considering their wood fired items, the pizzas, did not turn out even a fraction to what I have had elsewhere. Then they want to charge $15 for the tiny little pizzas just because they decide to throw a few pieces of high-quality greens over the top, then call it a day. My white pizza Ortolano, tasted like a dry piece of cardboard with a house salad thrown over the top of it. The red pizza Boscaiola, was better, but only because they added meat, and the sauce itself was a little spicy, but it didn't taste like it was from scratch. I wanted to taste olive oil, and basil or oregano. The bread was dry, too tough on the outside and flavorless on the inside. The waiter did bring oregano and crushed red peppers, but dry oregano doesn't really open up with flavor unless it gets moist with whatever you're cooking it in.The Farro Arancini appetizer/tapas was the best out of everything we had, but honestly, I make a mean chicken and rice dish at home that tastes just the same if not better. The rice is exactly the same. Lets face it, any of us should be able to accomplish this same dish in the kitchen. It was good, but not some epic culinary adventure in my mouth.Last, I was not impressed with the service. My waiter must have walked by my table twice without even noticing my empty wine glass. Then walked by my table once when I was ready for him to take the bill. The second time I had to stop him. He even had the audacity to snap at me, asking me if everything was okay with a snarky tone. I barely finished asking him to take the check before he cut me off. I would have given him a piece of my mind had I not had a dinner date (a friend I respect) with me who hates confrontation. The waiter was lucky I tipped him 20%. I tried to exercise as much grace as I could but this guy had me fuming. He was even wearing a hat the entire time he served our table. Last I checked, old school class is making a comeback. Take your hat off, bro.I should have listened to my coworker. He warned me that he felt the food went down in quality. I think he said it changed owners. He wasn't lying. Also, the footrest under my seat had broken so I was left to swing my legs under the table. The seats are high for some reason, so no one's legs reach the ground. After working 7 hours on my feet, that seriously disappointed me. There are plenty of wonderful reviews here, but don't come here expecting much. I have to agree with one Yelper, the music they play is really good, I enjoyed listening to Tove lo, Habits (Oliver nelson remix, which is my favorite) while I was there.

It's the best way to remind yourself there is so much more out there to watch and Netflix is keeping it from you. Thats part of the fun, what will I find at Specialty Video today?

They then tried to tell me they'd honor the Groupon for a pedi only, but I insisted it cover both since they didn't have any appointments open.

I have learned this.So I've tried a variety of places - some cheap, thanks to Groupons or LivingSocial deals - and others more expensive, at fancy spa salons.

I came across the salon thanks to a Groupon deal and have found the work to be just fine and the price even finer. Can't complain. The first few times Sonia did the work, and as much as the other girl does a good job, I found I was much less sore and bruised after Sonia. The room where the waxing is done is cleaner some days than others, and it is a little weird that no music is playing. Given how thin the walls are I'm fairly certain girls getting manis or having their eyebrows threaded can hear the \"riiiping noise\" of the waxing.

The nail techs I've worked with are sweet Eastern European girls that don't speak much English, but that is fine since they know the motions and words that are important! The polish selection is what I'd expect at any salon. They have all of the usual brands. My only complaint about the no chip is that they don't have the little chips to show the colors and so you have to open a lot of the bottles but whatever. They keep them organized (reds, pinks, blues etc together) so it's not hard if you have an idea of the color you're looking for going in.So far I've had one regular pedicure, and two no chip manis from this salon. My first no chip lasted a long time and would have lasted longer if I hadn't started to pick at it once it chipped! I wanted to keep my nails long and lovely so I got a second no chip right on top of that one but my nails are SO weak and brittle, that second manicure wore off in like 8 days or something. Each time, the girls have done a great job at shaping my nails and not cutting my \u00a0toenails too short or anything.

Haven't been in for a while but always liked it because the pizza was excellent, they were BYOB and they were usually not too crowded. The staff was always pleasant, the owner slung pizza in the back, always visited the tables to check on patron's meals. After having not been in over a year we came in tonight and brought some beer. We learned that they now had wine (fairly expensive) and beer (crap and Italian). We also couldn't get a straight answer about the fees to bring our own, other than an exorbitant $15 corkage fee for wine. Turns out there was a $3 per beer fee. We ordered, we ate, it was all very quick because that's how you go to restaurants when you have a 2-year-old. He was well-behaved, he wasn't screaming or yelling, he wasn't walking around, he wasn't throwing stuff. I'm not one of those halfwits who thinks their child doesn't misbehave, or who thinks every scream and yell should be recorded for posterity because it's so precious. But my son was not misbehaving. Towards the end of the meal, as we waited for a rather long time for them to take our check and give us change our son started to get antsy. He yelled a few times, so my wife took him out of his chair and he walked towards the front door where he stood waving goodbye to people, or rather persons because the place was pretty empty. In fact he waved goodbye to two people who left. At this time the owner was standing at the hostess station, leaning on it, looking not amused because a child was standing there really doing nothing. He frankly looked pretty annoyed. He was wincing like he was getting a rectal exam actually. My son let out a few more yells and that's when the owner decided that he needed to tell us that we need to keep our child quiet, because people were trying to enjoy their meal. He had made a few noises, I didn't see anyone complain and I think I would have known because there were only two other occupied tables and one of them also had a young child at their table. So my wife picked our son up and told the owner that we were just trying to pay our check, and the owner kept hounding us about keeping our son quiet. Again, I'm not some halfwit who can't recognize when my child is misbehaving. I'm not the kind of idiot who would bring a toddler to Alinea, or any kind of fancy, quiet restaurant. But this place has many high chairs, and often has many kids in the restaurant when we have been in the past. I'm not sure if business is bad and the owner just feels like being a smug dick to everyone, but that's what we experienced tonight and it was unfortunate, because I would tell anyone I knew about how great their brick-oven pizza was, how it wasn't anywhere near as crowded as some of the other brick-oven places in Chicago, how they were BYOB and it was a very casual, friendly environment.

Entirely. After a wonderful lunch at Andersonville's Hopleaf, my dear friend Rob and I decided to spend the day antiquing and thrift shopping through Chicago's lesbian Mecca. We hit all of the regular haunts: Brimfield for horrifyingly overpriced bric-a-brac; Brownstone to dig for buried treasure, and then we landed softly here: Ya Ya's. Of all the antique stores I have visited in Chicago (and there have been many, expect more reviews soon, dear readers), this has been my best experience so far. It could be that my friend is in great standing with the owners and they welcomed us warmly. It could be that both of the owners are delightful and dashingly handsome (what's up, boys?). But one thing is certain: it is definitely because this store has been built, arranged, and priced with the customer in mind. All pieces are displayed comfortably and priced at a level that is attainable. The same teacup that would run 50-60 dollars at Brimfield is 5.00 here. A plate made of carnival glass runs a reasonable 12.00. Examples of moderate, level-headed pricing abound and not a one sacrifices quality for affordability. For those of us who are young, scratching our empty wallets, and wanting to outfit our homes and lives with the very best that can be stolen from Gramma Mammy's house, this shop is heaven. I can't afford to drop a few hundred dollars on my auntie's full-length fur coat. I have to fill my china hutch and I don't want to empty my bank account doing it.

Fastest cup of coffee you'll ever make at home (well maybe, I don't have one of those K Cup Machines). Maybe I should say most rewarding cup for coffee you'll make at home with the richest, most delicious flavor.

We are hardcore Andersonville loyalists--and foodies. So, any new restaurant in the neighborhood wins our instant loyalty.While walking around the neighborhood one late afternoon a few days after the opening, we decided to check it out. \"Let's grab some wine and cheese,\" \u00a0my wife said. I happened to have our 3-month old baby strapped to my chest, but he was fast asleep, and mommas needed a drink. (Don't get all self-righteous on me, here.) We walked in and were greeted by the older female hostess. She didn't smile. Didn't attempt to exchange any pleasantries--for show or not. We asked if we could get a small bite and a glass of wine. While she was looking around the nearly empty restaurant, I also asked her about whether or not she thought we'd be okay coming the next evening (which was a Tuesday) for early dinner. I explained that we'd have a stroller, and I asked if they had any tables that were roomy enough that we wouldn't get in the way.I was making casual conversation and excited to try the place; she was not amused. She looked utterly exasperated and, eventually, said that she guesses we could go \"over there.\"She then directed us to the bar where, unbeknownst to us, we weren't allowed to sit \"with a minor.\" I totally get it. It's the law. They are a new establishment. So, we left hungry, shamed, and a little miffed. The point is, they just weren't very warm or welcoming. Yet, we still went back for date night the following weekend. Sans baby.Again, we were put off by coldness of the two hosts--the older woman, again, and a younger dude. Neither of them seemed to like their job. Or us. Or anything. It was almost enough to make us leave again, but we decided to stick it out.We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. Things after that weren't perfect: it took nearly 10 minutes for the bartender, who was very kind but very busy, to give us menus. We placed an order for a cheese plate and he came back 15 minutes later and told us he forgot to put our order in, asking what we wanted, again.When we did finally get a table, it took a long time to get menus or water. They brought out a ham flight and our cheese plate without explaining what was on either--just drop and run. The cheeses were delicious and varied, though. The older gentleman who was our waiter was fantastic, even though he seemed to be waiting on a dozen tables at the same time. He was very charismatic and seemed genuinely excited about the menu.And the meal was a solid 4 stars. The tarte tatin, cauliflower, and gnudi were standouts. The desserts were all mediocre. Not bad--just clearly not made by a pastry chef. I know the first half of this is a little harsh, but I wanted to give the honest opinion of someone who was--and still is--very excited to have this place in the 'hood. There are definitely some kinks to work out--and some staff to train--but I think this place could be a great addition to Andersonville.We will give wine and cheese at the bar another try--without the baby, next time.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 15]}, "0": {"description": "Amazing place, hands down.

The accompanying potato salad didn't taste like fast food or \"refrigerator section\" potato salad.

It's not to say that their food isn't good. It's quite okay, but there are other places in the city that do pretty much the same thing much better than TK does. Del Seoul and En Hakkore are two off the top of my head. Why can't TK be as good as those spots?I'm reviewing based solely on their tacos... Because it's in their name and it's what they should be good at so that's what I get. The flavors are always good but their portions are just not enough to satisfy and I end up cutting the tortilla in half to get the ratio of tortilla to filling at what it should be. Their shrimp and fish were over crisped and skimpy as well.

The woman who owns this place was always nice, she even seemed to remember me even though I came in maybe once a year. I have long hair and I would get my usual trim, long layers. She was always trying to talk me into shorter layers and one time, she wanted to go for bangs and I agreed. They looked great, I got compliments on the street. They were a pain to grow out, of course. According to the stylist at the fancy place I got my hair dyed (balayage at Epoch Salon) it was a good cut so I felt great about saving money. One time there was a bit of a wait, but not too bad. The owner is sweet, but the last time she was trying so hard to sell me some conditioner she's got, her comments and compliments felt forced and fake. But the main point is, I brought in a picture, discussed the cut in detail, we agreed on the length to cut very clearly, 4 inches, and then she cut off 8 inches. It was WAY shorter than what we agreed on. Also the layers were too long so I almost have triangle head and it's just basic (as in basic white girls) almost \"the Rachel,\" which I'm always desperate to avoid and give lots of instructions not to angle down from the face and is not at all the cut my picture had. I just wanted to get out of there. When I said it was way shorter than I expected, she said I had a lot of dead ends, however, I wish I'd been told before the plan was changed! I asked about the long layers since she'd always been into cutting short layers, and she said, next time you can keep the shorter layers but the bottom part will have grown out.

I have a MA degree in Popular Culture studies, and while I concentrated on film and TV, many friends worked with comics and comic book history and culture. Here's the thing: because I didn't grow up with it, it has always been difficult to go to a store and be taken seriously, as: 1. I'm a woman. 2. I admit to being a comic novice. 3. Again, I'm a woman. 4. I'm not a huge fan of superhero-based content. AlleyCat has changed all that, and now that I'm 30, I have finally found a place where I am comfortable and feel welcomed and not ostracized. I had gone in a few times with my husband (a huge comic book fan) and was, as usual, completely overwhelmed and way out of my element. I finally went in by myself, in the hopes of being able to find something that I would enjoy that wasn't just something my husband or friends told me I had to try. I wanted to find what works for me. Nick not only helped me find material, but asked what sorts of TV and film I watch to better assess things that would be good starts for me to read. He never pushed something on me, and I don't even think he was sure I'd buy anything, but he did spend about 20 minutes with me and actually listened. As in, he didn't flinch when I said I was a newbie and felt overwhelmed and didn't know what the hell I was doing. Instead, he listened carefully to my list of favorite shows and films and carefully selected items for me. The experience was so positive for me that not only did I walk out with about $50 worth of books (because they looked perfect), but that someone finally cared about what I was interested in and invested time on a busy night to help me out. My husband is a loyal customer, but they found a loyal customer in me as well. I can't wait to go back in this week and discuss how I felt about the selections I went home with (Saga, Chew, Gotham Central, Black Science, and Scalped) to better learn where my tastes lie.Bottom line: these people are wonderful and beyond helpful. If you have ever been afraid of walking into comic book store, this is the one to break you from that fear.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 1, 11]}, "15": {"description": "This is my Neighborhood Comicbook Shop. I'm here once a week spending all my hard-earned money on comics (don't judge me). The customer service is tops. Don't know what you're looking for? They'll happily recommend something that you'll end up loving. Remember a book you saw a few months ago and it was blue and about a superhero? They'll find it or die trying. Want to put a few books aside to pick up later? I'm almost 100% sure they'll do that. In short, they're extremely nice, and extremely knowledgeable, and would even probably help you deliver your child if the timing was right.Another thing I like about this store is that all are welcome. For all the time I've spent there I've never once seen a customer make it in the shop without being warmly greeted. No one is ignored; no one is slighted, and let's face it, you can't say that about a lot of comic shops. You're not going to get dissed for liking Bat Mite, or laughed at for digging Greg Land's art, or any other comic-related offense. Alley Cat just doesn't have that vibe.The vibe it DOES have, is clean, tidy, and warm. You won't be tripping over boxes of random crap, or accidentally knocking books off the shelves because they've been there for months and have started to warp. You won't smell that musty moldering old-book smell present in some shops (sorry, places who still sport the carpet you had when your store opened 25 years-ago, but you know it's true), And you won't run out of things to peruse until long after your parking meter has expired (be careful, this has happened to me a few times already) because the place is packed with great stuff.Not only do they carry all the titles from your Marvels and DC's (and all their imprints), but they treat independent /alternative/smaller-press comics with the equal reverence. They've got a huge selection of trades and graphic novels as well as a great selection of various games (Magic gatherings also happen here weekly, so, you can do that), statues, figures, shirts, magazine, AND a great kid's section! Can you even believe it? So much stuff...it's pretty amazing.Lastly, the neighborhood. It's a walking neighborhood as well as a parking, shopping, and driving-away neighborhood. Starbucks, Potbellies, lot's of eateries and ice creameries, and shops are within footsteps of AlleyCat (which is hidden at the end of a small. but completely safe alley between Starbucks and Potbellies). The only downside is that in the summer on Wednesdays - that's \"comic book day\" for those that don't know - there's a stupid old farmer's market half a block away (just kidding, it's excellent). \u00a0that makes parking a bit harder to find. Not nearly impossible, just a bit harrowing if you're running out of gas. Still, worth it though. Finally, you should really support your local comic shop. If you haven't been comic shopping since you were a kid (like in the 90's, like Youngblood, am I right?), or you fell out of it because you thought you'd set aside childish things for a job and a car and kids, well, you should go back NOW.

I really did. However, I struggled with the ends of the spectrum here. At what point does focus and precision (for the most part) outweigh just not having any customer relations skills? That is my quandary about evaluating this place.Since moving here, I have found it very difficult to find a good male stylist who can do good men's hair. It shouldn't be a problem. Perhaps I was spoiled by my stylist in Atlanta, but men's hair is not too difficult, even when you throw in color. That being said, I believe that men, unless their hair is long, should not be charged the same color prices as a lady whose hair is ostensibly longer. My stylist in Atlanta felt that way, but they don't see it that way at Styles.I read some reviews on here (Yelp) and decided to give Styles a try. My first inkling should have been when I walked in and the receptionist, with whom I had booked the appointment the day before, said I was down for just a cut (I rarely, rarely, rarely, just get my hair cut, or colored, without getting the other done, especially when I am going out of town for a week or so, as I was that next day.) After some real huffy looks from the stylist, they finally decided they could work me in for both. Thank you, and I'm so sorry to have been an inconvenience as a paying customer.The stylist did good work, except for leaving my right ear full of color in spots where my partner could visibly see but I could not. The cut was fine, the color, except for the globs in my ear, was fine, and I was happy with the execution. The friendliness left something to be desired, as did the price ($105). I'm sorry, but that's a rip-off. I wanted to give it another try, so I did the next month.The stylist was a little friendlier, and perhaps because it was on a Saturday, I didn't leave with any color in my ear. Apparently Saturday is the receptionist's day off, as my stylist doubled as receptionist and often interrupted the cut with having to answer the phone. When I paid, and tipped him (15%, which is standard for standard salon service, not excellent or outstanding service), he looked at me as if he were insulted. He did hand me a small Aveda sample of hand lotion. I liked the cut, so I wanted to give it one more try.Third time did it for me. Stylist wasn't as friendly and precise. (Side note: I don't get people in their reviews on here who say they've been going to him for 20 years and how great he is...maybe I looked like someone he really hated or something.) He was in a little bit of a hurry, as he was leaving the next day to go out of the country. Color was again all over my ear, and luckily my partner had become pretty good at removing it for me. The few times I did try to engage the stylist, another woman of some British background interrupted, and as her voice carries, she made it very clear that she was running this or that half-marathon, and it was clearly a case of \"those who have to boast that they're good at something usually are not,\" for if she's a competitive runner, then so is my great-grandmother (disclaimer, again: I ran cross-country collegiately, as in 70+ miles weekly, so I'm pretty good at identifying others who run, and knowing the language...not calling this lady a liar, but as Shakira says, \"hips don't lie.\") Most importantly, if she is doing those races, I didn't need to hear about them, and I didn't need to be interrupted with the little discourse I was able to pull from my stylist to hear about her adventures. This place just feels dated and old-fashioned. The customer bathroom looks worse than my first apartment's bathroom...you know, the one when you're first out of college. It could use a takeover by Tabitha. I hope while she's at it she inspires this stylist to have a little more personality. I'm not saying be over-the-top, but sometimes you just want your stylist to be friendly and not aloof, and especially not insulted when I tip you properly. I think this place has a lot of potential, but it needs some reinvestment. It was never busy when I was there, as I think the largest number of other customers I saw while I was there seriously was two.

This place is close to my apartment and they use Aveda products so it seemed like the most logical decision. I was able to get in the same day, which is a plus because when I want a change of hair style, I want it now.

Their Aveda products are cheaper than I'm used to paying too. The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this place is that they seemed to have over-booked Christian because halfway through my haircut his next appointment showed up. Perhaps they should schedule more than 30 minutes for each person. But this didn't seem to bother Christian. His overall demeanor was great. I'm not the kind of person who likes to chit-chat constantly while someone is cutting my hair, nor do I like to feel pressured to do so. While Christian was FAR from unfriendly, there was no awkwardness in the silences between conversations. So the five stars is really for Christian.

It had been over a year since I'd gone to a salon. While I'm not someone that normally spends a lot of time at a salon, this was atypical, as every 4-6 months is more common for me. So, I realize that my hair was very long and a bit of a mess. That said, I think it could have been handled better. When I came in, I explained that I wanted it cut so that my hair physically touched my shoulder and with bangs that moved to my left. He thought they should be to my right and I explained I really wanted them to my left. He agreed. He verified the length I wanted then, before brushing or washing my hair, pulled my hair back and promptly cut clear across with scissors. It was a blunt cut, and was much shorter than I had asked for. My hair was just barely below my ears. He then washed it. He did my bangs, which were on the opposite side of my face from what I thought we'd agreed on. All throughout the cut, he kept spontaneously explaining/justifying his cutting off my hair in one fell swoop like that. He told me it would make it easier to wash in his sink \u00a0(without my commenting on it), he told me that having it shorter would be good since I \"only cut my hair once a year\" (at which point I reminded him that I would get it cut more often with the right stylist), he informed my husband that my new style was \"more modern and feminine\" and, at one point, spontaneously tried to convince me that the length in the back was the length that I asked for (it wasn't). Note that I didn't complain about what he'd done, aside from asking him not to cut it any shorter than that. I won't claim that my hair was in great shape before I went in there or that giving it a good cut would be a quick or easy job. That said, as a professional, if he didn't have the time or ability to do what I was asking, it was his responsibility to tell me. If he needed to cut off part of it before we started, he could have cut more conservatively and if he _absolutely_ believed that he could not cut it without chopping that much off, he should have discussed that with me. It would have been different if it was a shorter-than-expected but otherwise competent cut. However, it was not. It actually _looks_ like someone just took a large pair of scissors and cut across. My husband, an optimistic man that generally insists that all of my haircuts are flattering, admitted today that it was poofy and the entirely wrong cut for my hair. Honestly, I could have had a friend with no experience cut my hair and had the same effect. Fortunately, I'm fairly low-maintenance about this sort of thing and can just toss a hat over it until it grows in, but I really shouldn't have to.

They charge $17 for a regular blowout, and then $27 (+ $10 for long hair) for what they call a blowout-straight that uses a round brush. I thought all blowouts used a round brush, so when I initially inquired about a blowout I was quoted the $17 (+ $10 for length) price. A regular blowout is just dried with fingers and a hairdryer, which I didn't know was an actual service salons offered.The employees were super sweet about it, and honored that original price but noted that in the future I'd have to pay the $27.

There are some good stylists who come through here, but they rarely stay.The first problem is the apparent appointment policy: I was told one cannot make an appointment without having named a stylist. I called today for an appointment later in the week and was told that without a stylist's name, I would simply have to walk in and wait. Despite explaining twice that I'd like an appointment since I didn't have a lot of flexibility in my schedule, the stylist speaking with me either did not understand, or couldn't simply tell me, \"We won't do that for you without a stylist's name. You have to walk in and perhaps wait for a chair on your lunch hour.\" Knowing about this can really save you some time and aggravation on the phone.The second is the sweatshop environment. It's often packed and always understaffed. There's no receptionist. All the stylists are multitasking. Working there is definitely not easy, especially in such a high-volume shop. This environment is also unpleasant for the customer. You can't really have a discussion about what's being done with your hair when your stylist has to walk away to answer the phone every two minutes because it rings non-stop.The third is the opaque service menu and pricing. Rather than have a menu clearly stating what the prices and services are in detail, there's a general menu and then upcharges for using a brush while blowdrying, for having long hair, for sitting with a master stylist (which you might not even know until you go up front to settle up!).There are a lot of reasonably priced mom & pop shops around the neighborhood.

Oh, it operates in much the same way as food. It goes into your mouth, you chew it and swallow it. I'm sure it even contains some smattering of \"nutrition.\" But you don't go to White Castle because you are \"hungry\" and want \"food.\" You go to White Castle because you are \"drunk\" and want \"White Castle.\" Or if you are not drunk -- and I understand some people go to White Castle when they are not drunk -- you come here because it's \"what you crave.\"Man, was there ever a more truthful advertising slogan? White Castle isn't about eating; it's about satisfying a craving. I suspect White Castle satisfies the same neurons that are assuaged by crack. Or chocolate. In fact, I think it makes more sense to discuss White Castle as candy than it does as food.Consider, if you will, the White Castle onion rings. To its credit, White Castle uses whole rings of onion in its onion ring, unlike Burger King or some other fast food joints, which use that minced onion crap. But the breading on those rings definitely contains some high fructose corn syrup, 'cause ring batter should not be so sweet. And an order of onion rings -- I hope you're sitting down -- has 430 calories. Unless you get the sack of onion rings, which has nearly 800. And fully half of those calories come from fat. What kind of food, outside of fat, gets half its calories from fat? Unless, of course, we're talking about the chicken rings, which get nearly two thirds of their calories from fat. There is, in fact, a higher percentage of fat in the chicken rings than in the mozzarella sticks.Despite this knowledge, now and then I crave White Castle. For the same reason I crave Entenmann's coffee cakes. And fortunately for me, Entenmann's coffee cakes are as inconvenient to get as White Castles. Which is to say, just inconvenient enough that I don't always give in to the craving, though convenient enough that I can if I choose to. This White Castle is fine.

I am one of the few peeps who doesn't get drunk to eat Whities. I deliberately go there, stone cold sober. Sometimes I even add lettuce, tomato, mustard and mayo. I know that sounds weird, but they are such cute little gems, those sliders.When I moved to CA I really missed them and cherished the times I could get them when visiting. Then the frozen variety came out and I was grateful for that! I would even add my own little pickles.So then I move back out here, and live in the Gold Coast. No Whities within miles! So, I was STILL buying frozen ones! OMG! When I would visit friends on the south side, I'd always stop and get me a sack to take home and pop 'em in the freezer. Believe it or not, the freshly frozen ones stand up okay. And now they have those marvelous pulled pork sandwiches! Love them, too!And then, it happened! While looking at a place in Edgewater to rent, there it was .... on Ridge Ave.! Thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I know the rental agent thought I'd lost my mind when I asked her to swing thru the drive thru. But she admitted she liked 'em too, and I was buying, so, WTF? I took a sack home to the Gold Coast to celebrate the new apt.

It's for the whole experience, and yes, my trip to White Castle was an EVENT.I have been to a White Castle exactly once before my visit to this location. It was either 1993 or 1994 and I was quite young. I cannot remember it so it's basically like I've never been. I have been driving by this White Castle for like 5 or 6 years, always wondering about it. I've become more captivated with it in the last several months. Finally I pulled the trigger.Last night, completely sober, midnight. It is time. Get in the car honey, we are going to god damn White Castle! My boyfriend warns me it's terrible and not to expect much. I'm not really expecting anything but I assume the food will at least be \"fast food good\" ......... The interior is exactly what you want out of W.C. It's faded and pale. The sticker logos on the soda fountain machine faded beyond recognition. The little \"bar\" of plastic lids is covered in so much suspect liquid and wrappers that I don't even want to set my soda cup down on it. The floors are sticky. The wall paper is sad and all the booths are faded and tired. Almost none of the tables are clean. The lighting is institutional, both too bright and too dark at the same time. It's maybe one of the most depressing places on earth. The patrons are even better. Either drunk or high or just totally bored white dudes, alone and slumped over, waiting for their meal. I imagine they have a game of Dark Souls paused at home. The pizza faced lad behind the counter is nice enough but clearly disgruntled. He calls out my order to some unseen cook several times with great annoyance, like he is certain he will get the order wrong (he does not). They seem backed up, they seem unprepared for the inevitable busy time that is midnight and later. At some point they call out with great distress that a tour bus is arriving. They are not ready. The food itself is mostly completely and unbelievably terrible. Like I said, I thought the sliders would at least be \"fast food good\", they were TERRRRIBBBLLLEEEEE. Cheese and salt couldn't even save these. I got 4 sliders in an effort to try \"one of everything\". Whatever that means since they have other slider flavors. They were all bad, maybe the cheese and bacon and cheese being the better of the four. I didn't realize HOW SMALL and thin the patties were. There is certainly no actual beef in these. Compressed and colored soy product with binder perhaps. Just so bad. I'm pretty sure they are cooked in a microwave, the amount of condensation on the buns making them so extremely soggy. I ate bits and bobs but could not finish any one of the sliders completely.Their crinkle fries were decent, most of them were crispy and they had good salt. Boyfriend ordered their mozzarella sticks. I will say these are good. Like surprisingly good, better than what I get a lot of pizza and pub restaurants. We didn't order the chicken rings which I regret as it will probably be another 20 years before I go to a W.C. again. We leave as the tour bus of drunk ass bitches descends.

I accidentally came upon Lilliana after moving to Andersonville 3 years ago, while looking for a local facial place. \u00a0A friend and I come in there now, every month or so, because we like her work so much.Her facials are SO relaxing. It's a time when I can meditate and stop the busy and she has classical music playing. \u00a0She does three or so masks, depending on skin type and needs, does a hand treatment \u00a0and massage at the end at no extra cost. She zaps problem spots with Galvanic at times. Sometimes I get a brow wax, and she's very good at shaping brows.Lilliana is such a great \"mother hen\" she notices everything you do, and is very intuitive and cognizant about what makes her clients most comfortable.My skin has never been happier.:)While her environment isn't plush with water-walls and expensive stuff, her quality skin care far outshines the need for any of this, by leaps and bounds!If you would like quality skin care, at a reasonable price, check Lilliana out!

The wax/applicator stick is applied to the crevices of my lady bits and then repeatedly re-dipping into the same bowl of wax that is applied to YOUR FACE during your eyebrow or upper lip wax immediately following my appointment = GROSS!! Other lowlights of my horrendous experience was when she trimmed my remaining landing strip with likely unsterilized electric clippers and wiped me down after with scary possible community wash cloth?

She also tells you what each mask or lotions does (which she changes, depending on what your skin needs).

The first visit, service was slow. Our server kept forgetting to bring flatware, and would walk by and say things like \"Oh, they still haven't brought it for you!\" as we sat there staring at our salads. Was it the busser's job and not his, even though he saw twice that we had no plates & no flatware? The table next to us was in the same boat. It was annoying, but just a little slow. Second visit: slow again. But worse. After receiving our beverages, our server left for quite a long time. At the same time, eight 9-year old boys descended onto the two tables behind us and were shouting, fighting over toys, jumping around, and even pushed one set of table & chairs into our table and chairs. One member of my party left to find our server, and I darted to the bar after having a table slam into my chair. It was like being at a Chuck E. Cheese, but without the band, and without having a child of my own drag me there. I explained to the bar staff the loud, obnoxious group of kids and they said they'd talk to their parents. I head outside, and a woman who I infer was a manager had come to take our order. I mentioned the situation with the unattended kids to her, and her reply was, \"Oh, they're with the birthday party inside. They should be leaving soon.\" The look on my face must have not been great, because a moment later she added \"would you like to switch tables?\" We switched tables, carrying everything on our own...I actually had to ask her to move so I could pull up an additional chair so everyone could sit at the new table. Placed our order and food came at a slow but not terrible speed. Our calamari and pizza were quite nice, too. We had a little hiccup with payment, though that's entirely forgivable...just an unfortunate concurrence with the other events. A restaurant should not allow one party to infringe upon the enjoyment of another party. They failed to control the situation - a group of loud, unsupervised, poorly behaved kids - and as a result, what should have been a nice summer evening on a patio, was a chaotic, shrieking mess. The parents are as much to blame here as well, but the staff could have gotten the parents to control their children.

I definitely picked up a few things here a year ago that wouldn't be found on their shelves today, so I guess they found their prime audience of 15-23, although, I believe, their prices don't align with that market. Cheaply made coats in today's styles for $88. That's ridiculous!

If you want a long-sleeve tee you could get at Old Navy? They have it. If you want a quality dress, they definitely don't carry that, but their assortment of funky dresses is always changing, so someone must not mind spending $45 on patchwork pieces of junk.Like Tomato on Belmont, the stuff seems to last 1-2 wearings. Yeah, not optimal. But I want to be clear: Though Presence is trying to compete with H&M, Urban Outfitters and even Anthropologie for the girl with less in her pocket, if you're going to spend $40 or more on something cute, either get it from Buffalo Exchange and get it cheaper used, or spend the money at Urban Outfitters to ensure you can at least get a season out of it.As for my sunglasses, my metallic-printed tee, my copper/gold/silver metal-studded bracelet: These get me compliments, and I got them all on sale. Each for under $10. And that's how I prefer to do Presence.P.S. Sign up for their mailing list and get coupons every month for $5 or 15% off.

We had some playful banter about it being my first time and she told me if there was anything I needed just to ask. After circling the store one more time I finally picked out a silk mask and tie set, a sexy board game, a bottle of flavored lube, and (the most exciting) vibrating cock ring. When I went up to the counter the associate asked if I wanted her to open the ring just to make sure it worked because of their strict return policy (which I appreciated and did), and afterwards she sealed it back up, rung me up (without making comments on what I had purchased, which being a little awkward already, I really appreciated), and we chatted a bit before I left.All in all, it was a great experience and definitely a store I will be going back to when I make the foray in to more varsity-level sex.

In addition to their regular menu, they had a menu of at least a dozen specials. I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken sandwich. The sandwiches come. With two sides - I had pickles and fresh fruit.First the chicken - I can't tell you everything that was on it. There were deep fried pickle chips, an aioli mayo and other items. There were two split chicken breasts. They were absolutely outstanding. They were crispy, but not at all greasy. The chicken meat was flavorful. The sauce, which on traditional Korean chicken can be very sweet, was only mildly sweet making it a great blend with the rest of the food.The fruit was a little disappointing. But, the pickles were an unexpected surprise. They were a combination of vegetables in a sweet, tangy pickle juice.This was a great experience.

We shared two apps: fried chicken BBQ poppers and crab dip. We really didn't care for either of them. The waitress mentioned the poppers were \"Korean style\" which I'm very familiar with and typically LOVE. What we got were Chicken poppers that were dressed in a glaze that was SO salty we couldn't eat more than a few bites. It tasted like they were doused in so much soy sauce without anything to balance all the salt. We tried dabbing the sauce off, disguising it with other sauces -- to no avail. The crab dip was also really hard to eat - didn't care for the flavors, and was really fishy tasting. We also shared the BLT which was a potato bun, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and bacon. The bacon was one strip, not super crispy and the whole sandwich was just very soft and soggy in texture. The two sides that came with didn't help: the mashed potatoes were near liquid and the Mac n cheese was cold, extremely mushy and lacked any flavor whatsoever. Considering we were famished coming into he restaurant, we'd typically be the easiest to please but the food left us so disappointed we couldn't stop talking about it even the day after.

In addition to their regular menu, they had a menu of at least a dozen specials. I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken sandwich. The sandwiches come. With two sides - I had pickles and fresh fruit.First the chicken - I can't tell you everything that was on it. There were deep fried pickle chips, an aioli mayo and other items. There were two split chicken breasts. They were absolutely outstanding. They were crispy, but not at all greasy. The chicken meat was flavorful. The sauce, which on traditional Korean chicken can be very sweet, was only mildly sweet making it a great blend with the rest of the food.The fruit was a little disappointing. But, the pickles were an unexpected surprise. They were a combination of vegetables in a sweet, tangy pickle juice.This was a great experience.

However, the service was just terrible, which was disappointing especially since I was looking forward to celebrating my birthday with friends. We have had our waiter several times before, and every time he has been rude, messed up our order, or acted like he had better things to do than wait on us. Unprovoked, several of my friends told me they had also had problems with this waiter before, but I figured it was my birthday, I wasn't going to worry about it. When we got there, he got us our drinks and told us everything could only be on one check. Understandable, we've got 20 people, that's a lot of checks to split, no worries, we can figure it out. He then proceeds to be short with many of my guests, and takes a substantially long amount of time to come back and check on us, often disappearing right before someone was about to order. If it had been busy, I would have been a little more understanding, but there were maybe four other tables full at this time, and they were all being served. But the kicker comes from the fact that the receipt was wrong three times. He had cashed out my friend when she left, and then left her meal on our ticket, even after my fiance, who is a mathematician, showed him that she had cashed out. He also left a salmon salad on the receipt which no one had ordered, but he took that off, so I can't be upset about that. He then argued with us that someone at our table had eaten a Cuban sandwich, even when I could tell him what everyone at the table ordered, and I knew that my friend who was sitting at a table who received a separate check had been the only one to order a Cuban. He insisted that he delivered one to our table, but everyone who sat there said that no one at that table had ordered a Cuban. He went and got his manager, who told us that his cook remembered preparing a Cuban for our table and therefore we needed to keep it on our bill. He told us he would take half off of the sandwich for our trouble. At this point, I was tired of arguing about a sandwich on my birthday, so I asked him how much the sandwich was ($12.50) and told him to take the money, anticipating that he would at some point take that half off and bring back change to me, which he never did. I am so disappointed. This was one of my favorite places to go in Andersonville up until this event. I had just had a fantastic afternoon at Jerry's the week before with a lovely waiter who I would have been happy to commend here had he waited on me on my birthday. Unfortunately, this particular waiter has ruined my Jerry's experience before, and it seems many of my friends previous experiences, and this time was no exception. I don't believe I, or any of my guests will be back to Jerry's any time soon. Oh, and waiter? We heard you complaining about us to your manager loud enough for us to hear, and yes, we did think it was necessary to argue about a sandwich on a $400 bill. Seems the customer is not always right.

It seemed the moment I asked him his suggestion between the two options I was looking at on the menu, he flipped a switch, and became non-communicative, and seemed very annoyed.

Thomas constantly walked around the restaurant with a huge chip on his shoulder, and we wondered what we had done to deserve such treatment. We do not ask for much when dining out, we are easy to get along with, and we just want decent service, this certainly was not the case.

One word, but if looks could kill, the coroner would have been called on the spot. We felt so unwelcomed by Thomas, we attempted to just give the check to the hostess, and when Thomas looked at me, he just turned his head, finally taking the check and my card after the hostess stuttered and stammered as to why I was bringing the check to her.

We ordered for an app the onion rings with creamy BBQ sauce, which was a great start to the meal. My partner ordered the fish and chips, while I ordered the shepherds pie. Both of these entrees came highly recommended by Check Please, which can be seen on WTTW Channel 11. When my partner received his entr\u00e9e, the fish and the fries were lukewarm at best, we promptly sent this back, which Donovan took care of flawlessly! He even offered the tomato bisque soup to tie my partner over while they re-prepared his meal! Awesome!!! The soup was just delicious! When they brought back the new order of fish and chips, it was very tasty. The shepherds pie was more of a letdown for me. It tasted ok, but it seemed there was just too much seasoning, something that I did eat, but due to the over seasoning, I am not likely to get again. I also ordered a side of cole slaw, which was very good. The fish and chips came with a side of mush minty green peas, my partner does not care for peas, but I tasted them, and they were just not good at all....If I were to order the fish and chips on a return visit, I would opt for another side, they do have a mac and cheese option as a side as well, more than likely I would pair it with the cole slaw.

Let me start of by saying my friend and I definitely over ordered so definitely do not feel compelled to order as much as we did LOLWe got:Mussels - come in a green curry coconut broth and is served with bread. Probably one of the top 3 mussels i've ever had. The broth was absolutely deliciousssss. I was using my spoon and drinking the remaining broth cause it was that good! Elotes- sooooo goood!! The corn was sweet full of flavor and the beer battered avocado was soo good. The avocado wasnt mushy on the inside as I would have expected. mac & cheese- I had high hopes for this since the reviews raved about it but I wasn't too impressed. Tasted like regular mac and cheese to me. Nothing really stood out.Japanese BBQ Pork Bao- This was good! The pork was tender and had a crispy layer of skin which gave the boa that extra crunch. The bun was so light and fluffy.Steak-Shitake Bao- the meat tasted gooood but im not the biggest steak lover because i like my meat really tender but the flavor was definitely there.Fish taco- definitely my favorite! The fish had a crispy batter that wasn't overfried or soggy. Shrimp Taco- definitely did not skimp out on the shrimp! If you like seafood, you'll definitely like this. \u00a0pork al pastor taco- comes with jalapano and pineapple which definitely helped amplify the flavor. This was my second last taco so by then it was kinda cold but the taste wasnt as great as I was expecting but I think that is just because it got cold :( Lastly we got the steak taco- once again, wasn't too crazy about it because it is steak and this was my last taco so the meal was kinda cold and the taco shell had hardened. Overall the meal came out to around $30 per person after tip and tax which isn't too bad considering all the food we got.

We had previously had a really rotten day of couch shopping at discount stores like Ashley, The Room Place and Value City Furniture, etc. These places did not have fabric options and I found, perhaps surprisingly, not that much cheaper than Cassona .... plus most of the couches were ungoldy uncomfortable and certainly of a lower quality. I wanted a gray couch which is apparently impossible, IMPOSSIBLE I tell you, to get at these aforementioned discount stores. Walking into Cassona I was presented with at least 3 beautiful gray couches plus tons and tons of fabric options. All the couches were very comfortable too, it was quite hard to decide since I was finally faced with beautiful couches in fabrics and colors I loved that had actual lumbar support. We ended up deciding on a 3 person sofa with chaise. The chaise is moveable/removable as it comes with a long cushion and an ottoman underneath that can be moved to the middle or other side of the couch, plus an extra cushion if you want to remove the ottoman entirely. The versatility to change the couch is a great option. The couches all seem to come with 2 accent pillows too and we got to choose through many many more fabrics for those. What I liked most about Cassona, other than the beautiful and not absurdly expensive furniture, was the helpfulness and honesty of the staff. John helped us yesterday and offered lots of helpful tips in choosing a couch and a fabric, explained the different kinds of fabric and how they wear and should be cleaned, explained the warranty and didn't pressure us to purchase. It was nice not feeling uncomfortable about coming back the next day to think it over through the night. We did in fact come back today and the owner helped us place our order and answered more questions. Everything about Cassona is class, from the style of furniture to the care from the staff. Quite a different experience from Ashley Furniture and Value City where I didn't have a singe sales rep offer any information on how the fabric wears or how one should clean it etc. I cannot wait for the couch to arrive!

Combine this with the fact that I am clueless and illiterate when it comes to interior design and that sort of thing, I didn't even have the terminology to say what I liked or wanted !! So it was a with a lot of trepidation I ventured into the store in Andersonville, the first encouraging sign was that they let me browse, a sales person checked in with me when I arrived and then let me explore and look for ideas. When I finally had some clue as to what I wanted I was lucky enough to be looked after by John who was amazing. He very patiently went through my lists, spent ages going through swatches with me, gently and diplomatically eased me away from my more horrendous choices and was genuinely interested in making the whole process work for me. At no point did I get the feeling that I was being encouraged to buy the more expensive choices and because of the size of the order he worked out a very generous discount. The furniture arrived this weekend and I could not be more pleased, I had brought some photographs with me of my new place on my first visit and that helped a lot, now that its all installed the entire package works. The delivery was efficient and very professional. My impression is that the philosophy in this store is that If they help you make good choices they will have a happy (return) customer and that's more effective in the long run than just selling you the most expensive item on the floor.

I just needed a quick shape and polish and didn't want to wait, so I figured I'd just jump into the first place I could get in. Jade was empty--now I know why--so I gave it a shot. I have no problem with no-frills, small-scale operations like Jade... in fact, I was happy to support a business that surely gets overshadowed by the fancy-shmancy salons surrounding it. Again: there's a reason for that.First of all, the first question my technician asked as I sat down was whether I'd gone to church today, which, combined with the framed picture of Jesus over her head, made me very uncomfortable when I told her no. But whatever, no big deal. Then I told her I wanted to keep my nails long, even though I had one short one that had broken. I told her just trim them a little, but don't even them out. Well, she did anyway, chopping a good 1/4 inch off my nails, which I like to keep long. THEN, she cut me while clipping my cuticles. Twice. I should have left then--which is what the woman who was sitting next to me did, after she ALSO got cut several times--but I figured, hey, all that's left is the polish, that's the easy part, just stay and get what you can of your money's worth.Bad idea. I picked a semi-difficult polish to work with, admittedly--sheerish and shimmery, the type of polish that needs three coats to look good. Well, she only did two coats, getting polish all over my skin in the process. It's mottled and I can still see my nail line. I could have done a better job myself, and not been manhandled in the process. Oh yes: She was also very rough throughout, grabbing and yanking my hands all over the place, and arranging them in uncomfortable positions so they were in front of the one, tiny fan she refused to move. Oh, and after making sure I paid before the polish--no problem, good idea--she first questioned the amount I left--INCLUDING A 20 PERCENT TIP because I spent years in the service industry and can't not tip, it's a sickness--then insisted on also putting my coat and scarf on for me so I wouldn't have to do it afterward... because apparently she didn't want me hanging around long enough for them to dry, even though I was super-hot with the coat on. And then when it was FINALLY over, she just got up and walked away, not bothering to point me toward the fans or say goodbye. So I just left. It was awkward, she was awkward, it made me awkward.

I could easily see Acre becoming a regular brunch spot for me.I ordered the chicken and waffles. I've never ordered this dish anywhere before. Honestly, growing up in the South I'd never seen it on a menu. I've always thought of it as something Northerners think Southerners eat. However, that day my personal bias was relaxed and I gave it a try. It was delicious! The waffles were fluffy and crispy at the same time. The chicken was very good as well, though it was deboned. I don't know who started the deboning trend but it needs to stop. The sole reason this place isn't getting five stars from me is that fried chicken should never deprive one of the delicious sensation of licking the meat off the bone. A friend ordered the fried green tomatoes benedict and it was very good as well. My husband and her husband both ordered burgers. I suppose they liked them as they devoured them leaving no trace of their existence. The cocktails were also quite good.The prices were surprisingly low for brunch in Andersonville. Although, maybe the high price point exists only in my mind because I've never broken my budget on a Sunday morning in this neighborhood. I can't wait to go back and try more of their selections...if I can manage not to order the chicken and waffles every time.UPDATE: I've been back and ordered the corn cakes. These were amazing. They were rich and delicious. They almost reminded me of pineapple upside-down cake. They paired really well with the chorizo and pork confit.

Not sure if I over hyped it for myself, but I wasn't too impressed. Given that this is only their first week, I might need to come back once all the kinks have been handled.Time: Around 7pm on a Saturday night. Bit of a wait, but there is a bar to keep yourself preoccupied. Service: Needs some TLC.- Seems like the area we were seated by were by the house's \"VIP\" which meant they took priority than the rest of the other tables. As a result, a few of the tables including ours were neglected.- Missing that fluidity and consistent as our table was the only table in the place without sauce. It took a couple of tries to get someone to notice us but when we finally asked, the food came and we had to wait for the sauce.Food: Wish I could say everything was on point.- We wanted to try a little bit of everything, so we got the sandwich combo - chopped brisket on a brioche bun served with cole slaw and fries, then half a rack of St. Louis ribs and baby rack ribs, and 2 sides: creamed corn and baked beans.- Of our feast, my favorite would probably have to be the brioche bread, the fries, and cole slaw. The chopped brisket paired with a perfect brioche bun. The bun was warm and fluffy. We did our own little creation by drizzling all three of their sauces on top of the chopped brisket, which enhanced the flavor by making it a little sweet, tangy, and spicy, then we threw some of the slaw on there. I am usually not a fan of cole slaw, but this one was pretty good. Light and unique. The pineapple and raisin was definitely a nice touch. - I like my ribs to fall off the bone, so this one didn't cut it for me. Both the St. Louis and baby rack did not have that soft and juicy texture that I look for in my ribs.- Lastly and sadly the sides, the baked beans wasn't as saucy as other bbq joints I have been too. There was too much going on in there so it lacked layers of texture. My least favorite of all was the creamed corn. For me it was the taste because I did not expect it to taste so sour. The tanginess was definitely overwhelming and the after taste lingered.Overall, it was their first week in, so I will probably need to stop by again once all the kinks have been addressed and the restaurant finds their groove as their service could use some work, and the food needs quality control.

Their menu for restaurant week caught my attention, and we visited here on a Saturday night around 8:45 with an open table reservation. We were seated right away and the server took drink order. I got the Abita christmas ale (another obsession after NOLA visit), and my bf opted for the Old Fashioned. They were both good!For the food: I got the vegetarian gumbo, and my parter had the cajun boudain balls. The gumbo was delicious with al dante rice, but I really liked the boudain balls better as the appetizer. For the entree, I had the alligator and sausage piquant - a curry style dish with rice. And that, taste was so unique and so delicious. The red sauce had the perfect balance of spice and sour that complicate the alligator meat and the rice. I don't know if it's in their regular menu, but it was delicious! My parter had their famous fried chicken, and it was the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago so far! (the best ever has to go to Willie May's in NOLA) We also had a jalapeno bread side, which was fluffy and the perfect amount of cheesy packed into the little bite. And finally, for the desert, I opted for the pecan pie with ice cream, and my bf got the calan (a fried donut type of texture with powdered sugar). My pecan pie was great, a good balance of sweetness and ice cream and I enjoyed very much!Service was fast, we were checked on multiple times. I can't wait to visit again!

However, my favorite entrees here are the regular jambalaya and the blackened fried chicken, so try one of those the first time you come here.

Yelped \"waffle,\" open now, highest rated, within six blocks. \"Big Jones it is,\" my brain decided, just barely before my legs started legging and my arches started arching.But a quick scan of the menu on the outside window turned off my Pavlovian glands. Top to bottom, bottom to top: no waffles. But what is this? Popovers?!? One of the big joys in my life when I was small that carried over to today!?! They were there alone in their glory at the top of the menu, and served under benedicts at the bottom. Let me confess; I'm not a huge fan of poached eggs or the benedict sauce, though I'll take a sip of my friend's Benedictine after-dinner drink on occasion. And I certainly wouldn't sully my popovers with anything but sweet butter. With popovers accompanying no other meals on the menu, I had to get creative. The O'Brien Potatoes sounded promising, and the Tasso ham simmered in some-guy's-farm cream sounded decadent. (Really, do diners have a clue about these farms?  \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Our ham is from 'Finca Fingida' [Bogus Estate].\"  \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Really?!?! Let's have that, honey!!!\") Yes, three sides would be the perfect assortment.Shortly after I sat down, an amuse bouche was set down to entertain me. Actually, about seven bouche-fuls. I vaguely remember the Caf\u00e9 du Monde beignets in the Crescent City, but I won't forget these. With a perfect doughy-ness inside, a crispy outside, I was as high as a crescent moon. Already, Big Jones, throw down!The potatoes turned out to be perfectly-cook, shredded-style hash browns. The ham was thick cut, and classily-accompanied by the cream sauce. The popovers were as fantastic as mama had taught me to make them; and the high-quality butter was worthy of them. As good as the food was, Adolpho was an excellent server: being neighborly, without snooping. The only \"burp\" in the experience was the price of the mimosas. Eight dollars, when the cava alone cost $7?

My friend and I came for our 5:30pm reservations and the place was still empty except for a couple of people sitting at the bar. We were seated right away and water was served once we sat down. Our server was okay, she was pleasant but nothing special about making us feel really \"welcome\". They only have very few wine selections that they offer per glass, mostly are being sold by the bottle so that's a minus point for me. Here is a breakdown of what I've tried at Big Jones tonight:CAJUN BOUDIN BALLS- crispy pork liver and rice sausage fritter----it was like crabcake patties but tastelessCOUSH COUSH- the crispy oysters were bleh and hot water cornbread tasted like plain fried breadFRIED CHICKEN- it was crunchy, seasoned well... The red beans and collared greens which were served with the chicken were good. This dish was delicious but nothing that I am going to rave about.ALLIGATOR & ANDOUILLE SAUCE PIQUANT- first time trying gator tail and it was interesting. The meat was very chewy and hard to breakdown. I've eaten other animal meat/parts, but I am not a fan of this gator tail. JALAPENO PEPPER CORNBREAD- served warm in a hot skillet. Very rich, cheesy, with a little kick from the peppers and a little salty. GATEAUX NA-NA - it's basically a praline pie, nothing much to say about itCALAS- it's just like a donut, dusted with powdered sugar. Nothing much to say about it as well.Overall, it was just an okay dining experience for me. I had a good time with my friend but I would say that I've had higher expectations about what Big Jones had to offer..maybe I expected too much. Would I recommend it? Maybe if someone wants to try a gator tail dish, I would tell him/her about Big Jones because it's the only place I know that serves alligator meat here...but for an extraordinary dining experience that will challenge your tastebuds, specially on a night that you want to explore new flavors, then I will not recommend the place.

They sell all sorts of devices that were probably useful in the 1980s (e.g. a small plastic thing that plugs into your corded phone that allows you to turn without twisting the cable into knots), as well as modern tools. They even have a small selection of kitchen gear (can-openers, bottle-openers, etc). I couldn't really tell if the prices on tools and parts were great - I'm no expert - but the keys were a buck-and-a-half each, and done with great speed.

The poor things must have had to make do with making conversation...and drinking coffee. And communicating by--oh, the horror!--landline phone, written mail, or in person.Coffee. Actual coffee. Serious coffee, as in the Pre-Starbucks era (before Starbucks sold drinks), when a drip was a drip, an espresso an espresso, a cappuccino a cappuccino and \"latte\" was Italian for \"milk\" (the drink was called a \"caffe latte\"). \u00a0And for anything flavored, sweeter, creamier, or icier-blended you went to the ancient facility called (variously) a \"soda fountain,\" \"malt shop\" or \"ice cream parlor.\"I popped into La Colombe because: I'd seen the name mentioned in the Yelp section of the EveryBlock Chicago digest; I'd just finished my hair appointment and still had 15 min. left on my parking meter; and I wanted some coffee, not necessarily food, before my next errand. There it was, right where I'd parked. Surprised to find it was a coffeehouse and not a restaurant, given its corner location at A'ville's major intersection. Nice cool dark granite-wood-steel-brick vibe balanced by massive windows to let in the light. Walked up to the bar, and to my delight saw \"cortado\" listed on the drink menu. I'd discovered those in Spain a few weeks ago: bigger than a macchiato, smaller than a flat white, less foamy than a cappuccino. Two strengths (single & dbl. shot) and two sizes (classic and \"workshop,\" whatever that was) for all their coffee drinks. No rainbow array of syrup bottles, no huge display of pastries, sandwiches, and whatever--just a couple of what they were featuring that day.My decaf cortado was perfect (the barista gladly made it a \"breve\"--with half & half--at no extra charge; will check out hemp milk later on, as I'm always looking for a low-carb alternative). There was a lovely bit of latte art, it was hot but not scalding, the taste was smooth and balanced and the texture nicely uniform. Music? So unobtrusive I didn't even notice it--which is the way I want it when I'm not going out specifically to hear live music.Drank my cortado, watched the world go by, and was on my way in under 10 minutes. Which is as it should be. Need wi-fi for free? There is a marvelous invention called a PUBLIC LIBRARY. Check it out.Note: I say \"coffeehouse\" and not \"coffee shop\" because to me--after growing up in Brooklyn and \u00a037 years living in Chicago--\"coffee shops\" are those luncheonettes (\"diners\" without the real or faux rail car exteriors) run by a seemingly extended clan of Greek restaurant owners.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 3]}, "51": {"description": "I think just for the flavor of the coffee, it's 5 stars.

It was amazing to see the passion he put into sourcing the finest ingredients from around the world. When he opened a shop just down the street in Andersonville, we were itching to give his coffee a shot. I was not prepared for what we found.I'll admit, that 9/10 I'll lean towards Starbuck's over any other coffee shops -- not that there's generally that much of a choice. I know a small handful of independent coffee shops in various cities that outclass the Seattle juggernaut, but those are far and few between, in my humble opinion.But when we walked into Colombe, that list just widened. It's obvious that not only do they source amazing coffee, but they put a lot of emphasis into teaching their baristas to prepare it the right way. Every brew I've tasted gives you so much unique flavor, never with any bitterness or excess acidity. They just KNOW how to take the best ingredients, use them in the right way to make the perfect brew.I especially love the pull taps for the cold coffee. I highly recommend trying a \"Black and Tan\" (cold brew coffee with whole milk). I'm generally a \"straight black\" drinker, but when I come to La Colombe, that rich, milky concoction is just too much to pass up. What I love is that they don't mess with the coffee flavor... no stupid peppermint sugar spiked bullshit.

They carry a variety of products from glass pipes, dugouts, one-hitters, and also regular briar tobacco pipes, cigars, cigarettes, and loose cigarette and pipe tobacco. So I have upped the rating from one to three stars. My original review is still here in it's entirety (I was a little bit emotional at the time).---------------------------I usually buy my tobacco from Andersonville Wine and Spirits on the corner, but sometimes I buy something at Ash's when the mood strikes.

We mainly buy incense from this shop, but I have bought some loose tobacco and a cheap pipe from them.When they first opened the place was bare, but lately they have added some comfy chairs with little side tables, and some art on the wall. It is a little more inviting now, but I still don't see too many people go in there.The reason I am giving them one star is because of an incident I had with them on Christmas Eve. I bought a necklace for my wife as a little \"extra\" fun gift. I know I shouldn't expect much from a inexpensive necklace bought at a head-uh I mean tobacco-shop, but I didn't expect the item to literally fall apart as I took it out of the bag when I got home.So I decided to take it back and exchange it for something else. The guy behind the counter wouldn't take it back. He remembered me, and I had the receipt, but he refused to work with me. He kept insisting that the necklace was fine when he put it in the bag. He did offer to sell me something else at a discount, but I didn't want to spend more money, I just wanted to exchange the item. After more haggling, he pointed to a sign on the wall that says \"All Sales Are Final.\" I can understand the sale being final for a pipe or a cigar, but a necklace is a different story altogether. These guys clearly have a few things to learn about customer service.As I walked out the door, I told the guy that he just lost two customers.

First, like many McDonald's they don't seem to care who sits in their booths or for how long. Many times I've gone in, and seen the booths all filled, one customer a piece, nursing only a small coffee, but clearly in it for the long haul reading a paper, staring vacantly out the window, or going through one of their bags of belongings. I feel bad for these folks as they don't seem to have anywhere to go or anywhere to be, but sometimes it would be nice to find a booth for my family. It's okay, it's like that in McDonalds around the country, maybe the world, it's just annoying how often it happens. Another annoyance, as of a few months ago at least, they were employing some jackass to sit in their car all day to monitor whether or not people were parking in their lot then going elsewhere, ready to pounce and give them an expensive boot. So beware, you will most certainly be booted if you even go next door for a second. Crappy business practice in my view but whatever, it's their place. Before they employed this goon I've never seen the lot completely full ever, so I'm not sure what happened. From what I understand though this boot company approaches businesses with an offer to monitor their lot, and perhaps give McDs a cut of the profits I don't know. That's vulture capitalism for you. Hopefully this kind of practice will be outlawed some day but for right now they've got a zero tolerance policy.The food here is standard, nothing special, nothing gross. The staff is always courteous, if not friendly. They've messed up my order many times when I've come through the drive through, but isn't that normal for McDonalds?It's usually fairly clean though they do seem to have trouble cleaning off the unused tables sometimes. Maybe they're just completely surprised when a table is vacated. Overall, you know, it's a McDonalds.

We ordered two appetizers -- \u00a0Yesiga Sambusa which is like an empanada -- only it is not -- it is two thin shells hand-wrapped and stuffed with a blend of minced beef, onions, peppers and wonderful herbs. We also tried the Kefta meatballs made from lean ground beef. The amalgamation of the crushed peppers, onions and spices and other traditional herbs were ethereal. They have an exceptional selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes here. In fact, we counted 13 items for vegans and 16 items for vegetarians! You can order a side of rice for two bucks. \u00a0We ordered the Awaze Tibs which consisted of tender cubed beef marinated in a fantastic broth with a touch of tomatoes, onions and jalape\u00f1o and just the right hint of fresh garlic and berbere sauce. I rate this dish with 4-1/2 stars. The beef was a little bit too fatty for my taste, but I know it is \"fat\" that gives meat tenderness as well as flavor. We also tried the Doro Tibs and this was my favorite dish. We shared both dishes. This dish was boneless pieces of chicken saut\u00e9ed in seasoned butter with hot pepper and onions and awaze sauce. What we enjoyed most is that they will make the food as spicy (that is, heat wise) mild, medium or extra hot. This is good for those of us who do not like super spicy foods that clean out our sinuses!The traditional dish of Ethiopia is wat. I saw a few dishes on their menu containing wat. Wat is a a hot spicy stew which is accompanied by injera (this is a traditional large spongy pancake made of teff flour and water). Think of injera as their version of bread. There are varieties of wat, such as, chicken, beef, lamb, vegetables, lentils, and ground split peas stewed with hot spice known as Berbere. The Berbere here is truly bold, and made with dried red hot pepper, herbs, spices, dried onions, dried garlic and salt. The Wat is served by placing it on top of the injera and the food is eaten with fingers by tearing off a piece of injera and dipping it in the broth of the Wat. Service was very slow, but hospitable and kind. This is a family-owned restaurant. Portions are generous and the price-point is affordable. Our total came to $33 and change (excluding tip). You can share several dishes if you go with a group. Although the meat dishes are served individually you can still share them! They also offer weekend specials, so we'd like to come back for their weekend specials. For example, I would like to try the Doro Wat (tender chicken marinated in lemon saut\u00e9ed in seasoned butter and stewed in a red pepper sauce, onions, garlic and ginger with a pinch of cardamoms and nutmeg). We enjoyed the experience and the food was worthy of 4-1/2 to 5 stars. We can't wait to return!Wine Recommendations -- if you order a lamb or beef dish I recommend Kadette Pinotage Ros\u00e9 (about $15) which offers lovely floral aromas and juicy raspberry flavors. Dry and full-bodied in the mouth, it pairs perfectly with veal, beef and other tender steaks. OTHER WINES: You can't go wrong with a good red Bordeaux, a California or Australian Cabernet Sauvignon, a Washington state Merlot, an Argentine Malbec or a Spanish Rioja.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 2, 17]}, "49": {"description": "Everything was fast and tasted great!", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 8, 28]}, "40": {"description": "We went to Lalibela this past Saturday and have fallen in love. \u00a0We are big fans of Demera and Ethiopian Diamond, so we didn't know what to expect. \u00a0Highlights of the evening included:-BYOB-BEST Injera I've EVER tasted-2 entrees and 2 sides, an appetizer, coke, tax and tip for $37-BEST kitfo I've had in Chicago-The lamb was like butter - I've never had lamb so tender and well seasoned-My boyfriend offered to pay me so he could finish the lentils.. they were unbelievableThe service was slow - they actually warn you on the menu because of the preparation time needed in the kitchen - but it was worth the wait. \u00a0I also felt perfectly full afterwards.

The injera bread here is darker (maybe whole wheat or a different style from what I've had at any other Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago or NYC) and delicious.

If you aren't a spicy fan ask for the #9 Yemser Wat to come less spicy. The doro wat (chicken) was fairly spicy but delicious.

What can I say besides it was worth it! We have tried a number of different Ethiopian spots in the past which are a wee closer to home, but this is our new favorite!Without a doubt, this place serves the best injera I've ever had. After the first mouthful, followed half a roll, at which point I realized there might be a problem, but polished off the other half while attempting to assess the situation - even though we had just finished our appetizer and the entrees had arrived. Besides, of course, injera, we had spinach sambusa, kitfo, and Lalibela special tibs. For the non-vegetarians among us, regular entrees (i.e. non-combination platters) are also served with two sides per table. As with nearly all Ethiopian restaurant experiences, the portions are larger than they first appear. This was especially true of the meat dishes. Most generous serving of kitfo I've ever had and the special tibs was fantastic, by which I mean in that I'm-so-full-oh-why-am-I-still-eating-this-I-hate-myself-just-a-little-more sort of way. (Note: the kitfo here is a little denser than at some of the other places. Pro: There is actually a lot more than you think there is. Con: There is actually a lot more than you think there is.)The owner is thoroughly lovely and helpful, chatting with customers while they were waiting for their dining partner to return from the restroom. We actually arrived at an odd time of day, between normal lunch and dinner hours, but were seated immediately and did not feel awkward.Although cats are of the order carnivora and cannot sustain life without meat, lolcats are well known to consume vegetable matter for stupidity and pleasure.

I mean, the front dining area was completely empty and the main area in the back wasn't even full.We were seated near the back with the booths. The booth seat is highly uncomfortable for short people like me...legs danging and falling asleep. I really hoped the breakfast made up for it. I know they have specials here listed on the black board, but it really would've been nice if the waitress announced specials of the day rather than what would you like? I really really wanted pancakes so I went with the blackberry bliss hotcakes. My boyfriend got a cinnamon roll french toast. Within 5 miinutes of ordering, the server brings another table's order out by mistake. I was like, that's lighting fast service, only to wait another 10 mins or so before our food came.So the hotcakes were super fluffy layered w/warm blackberries & vanilla mascarpone cream, & topped w/a brown sugar & oat crust. You can totally eat this sans syrup with the delicious berry sauce that gives it the perfect hint of sweetness. Of course I got a side of candied applewood bacon as a savory item to go with it. It's a delicious sticky mess, but I wish it was a tad bit more crunchy. Nonetheless, still good. The house baked cinnamon roll dressed with warm fruit, vanilla neufchatel creme was also topped with a granola crust. It wasn't overly sweet and the mixture of textures was lovely.A very good breakfast option in the Andersonville/Edgewater area.

I had sort of long hair and at the first appointment I wanted to do the full choppery, but I had had short hair as a kid and it was an afro. An afro as an 8 year old in the 90's... it was a hard time in my life. Nate convinced me to wait and see how the first cut went. So we waited. Cut to June- In a moment of drunken courage and stupidity I decided to let my equally drunk friend cut my hair (I probably wouldn't have had the guts to do it sober).I came in to see Nate with some trepidation, but he was totally awesome.

I have curly hair that is the opposite of cooperative, so I'm selective about stylists. Lucky for me, Sine did not disappoint. My first cut was with Nate, who is just the most dapper man I've ever met. He did an incredibly adorable short bob for me, and didn't mind at all when I whipped out my phone to show him pics of Lizzy Caplan as inspiration. \u00a0He was interesting to talk to, too, and didn't push products. He gave me tips on the best ways to style it quickly (cuz I'm lazy), too. Best of all, he didn't discourage me from certain styles! He seemed to know intuitively how my hair would actually behave with certain cuts, rather than assuming like some past experiences I've had, and he was not wrong. Also? Epic shampoo. My second visit was quite a few months later, and he seemed to remember me, which I loved. Also, he didn't push talking when I wasn't feeling talkative. This is huge to me. I'm sure some women enjoy the social aspects of talking to their stylists, but I talk for work - I love being able to quietly enjoy my cut more often than not. But like I said, when we did talk, it was awesome and he's just a great guy. Jack! Jack is wonderful. I snuck in an appointment the day of a wedding in mid June. My hair was getting shaggy and I lucked out because she had a cancelation and the wonderful receptionist (I believe her name is Katie) hooked it up pretty last minute. I was nervous because of the aforementioned finicky hair, plus I love Nate already and have some serious stylist loyalty. But my hair needed to go, so I took the shot and man. Bullseye, my friends. Jack is, first of all, just a joyous magical person. She also has curly hair, so we discussed ways she keeps hers so tame and lovely. I went in with a kind of vague idea that I wanted a pixie style that would look cute when I put like 2 minutes into it. She totally ran with it, and it looks amazing. She also recommended one product, a pretty inexpensive Aveda liquid gel. I was hesitant at first because gel and my hair have never mixed well before but yay for Jack - This stuff is great! I swipe it through my hair with my fingertips and comb my bangs straight, then absentmindedly scrunch the gel soft when it has mostly dried.

There is also a register all the way at the back of the shop, which is largely obscured by wine shelves; on several occasions, while trying to purchase something at the front counter, I've been redirected to the back register where -- in theory -- it will be quicker to check out. Unfortunately, the folks at the front counter can't really see how many people are lined up at the back register, and today I once again found myself in a line four-deep at the latter, which wasn't moving at all because the person at the front of the line wanted to ask the person on the register everything about everything. After ten minutes of that, I eventually just went back to the front register and waited another five minutes to pay for my purchase there; if the items hadn't been things I needed for tonight's dinner, I would have just left without them.Again, I like this place, and love their bread, cheese and wine selection.

There is never a lack of inspiration at either location. The stores are of decent size and full of fun, quirky, and original design concepts/ideas, products, etc., etc., And the featured products/design seem to change on a fairly regular basis, so there is typically something new and different every time I go there; which is refreshing. The owners and/or buyers have a keen eye for design that is current, eclectic, refined and smart. This is my go-to place for original, non-cookie cutter gifts, cards, as well as for inspiration for those extra special touches to my own interior design work and artwork. While I have not had the pleasure of having anything framed there, I have seen the work that they do, first hand, and it is of high quality. They frame for several artists in Chicago. The only down side, for me, is that some items are a little pricey, depending on what you are seeking. There were things there I would have purchased if the price was right for my budget. (Perhaps I just have expensive taste =p )I have never tried to barter or \"haggle\" on prices, so I am not certain if they are flexible on this or not.

Go in for a consultation. If the stylist doesn't answer your questions the way you think they should or suggests anything you know from years of curly cuts shouldn't be done to curly hair -\u00a0walk out IMMEDIATELY. Like I should have.Long story:I have super-thick curly hair. I used to see someone at Toujours who was wonderful -\u00a0the first cut she ever gave me was the only time in my adult life that I walked out of the salon and didn't immediately go home to play with it (instead, I went out for drinks in Andersonville, confident and happy!). Alas, that wonderful stylist is no longer cutting hair at Toujours. And I did not leave confident and happy this time around.As with all tales of hair woe, I did the thing I told myself I shouldn't do: I went in for a cut instead of a consultation, and I didn't leave when my head and my gut told me to.I called the salon to book, so I could check up on the other stylists who were cutting curly hair. I asked what kind of techniques the salon employed in cutting curly hair (knowing that my last stylist knew how to cut using Devachan and using carve/slice techniques). The receptionist said, \"We don't limit ourselves to one style of curly hair technique.\"She was right: because my stylist didn't use one style curly hair technique. Not a single one.Here are the Pros of what happened during my appointment with Sarry: *\u00a0Sarry is personable and enthusiastic. He's good at keeping clients engaged.*\u00a0He made a few adjustments to my hair after I protested a bit on my way to pay. *\u00a0After the cut was done, he was insistent that if I didn't like it, I should come back and he'd fix it. Which is nice and professional of him, but I won't let him touch it again.Now for the Cons:*\u00a0He was ten minutes late in starting the appointment -\u00a0he had run over with another client. He was apologetic, but came off as frazzled.*\u00a0He cut my hair wet. I have been getting dry cuts since 2007, so I found this more than a little weird. When asked if he cut curly hair dry -\u00a0or if he would dry-cut it while fixing it -\u00a0he said he could only cut it wet.* After shampooing me, he proceeded to give me a blunt bob -\u00a0the kind that people with thin, stick-straight hair get ('cause it looks super-cool on them!), where the stylist meticulously measures each side and cuts the ends while they're stretched out over a fine-tooth comb. The kind of cut that, when done on a head of thick, curly hair, gives the curly girl a different classic look: triangle hair. The kind that plagued my teen years in the late 90s and has made this summer's go-to hairdo a topknot.*\u00a0For all of this, I was charged $75 for a \"curly\" cut that didn't employ any of the techniques that my old curly stylists would use, and took about 30 minutes (not counting the fix). It was a straight cut, and I should have been charged accordingly.I won't be back.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 7, 19]}, "49": {"description": "Very nice salon. Love my hair cut.

It's really a detail, but it makes a big difference. They were very thoughtful with their process, and it shows. I'm more satisfied than I've been with my color in a long time.

I do not know how the other stylists are, but the one I went to, Karina, did not know what she was doing. She was not educated at all about curly hair. After doing some research on my own, I found out the information she gave me was incorrect. For example, a product that contains keratin does *not* put moisture into the hair or make it curly. It is an ingredient that helps repair damage hair or helps prevent breakage when applying heat. If you have healthy hair it will dry it out and make it stiff or hard. I talked to a cosmetic chemist who use to work for L'Oreal, and she said in this country what most people want is to have straight hair, so the keratin infused products are design to add strength (providing protection to the hair shaft while breaking down the bonds to make curly/coarse hair straight) when putting heat on \u00a0it, or as I mention earlier help repair damage hair; if your hair is healthy it will dry it out and/or make it hard--- which is what happened to mine. \u00a0She also kept putting products in my hair that dried it out even more, and then she stuck me under more heat after the shampoo woman completely ringed all the water out my hair (for you non-curlies, curly/coarse needs water to keep it moisturized and heat is a big no-no because it gets the moisture out). It took me a good 3 months to put back the moisture in my hair. Once I got the moisture back I noticed my hair cut was uneven. To top it off Karina kept saying \"this is what you wanted\" obviously blaming me for her poor performance. \u00a0When I felt the shorter side was long enough, I went back to my old salon in my hometown \u00a0and had one of the stylist correct the cut. It is still not where I want it to be, but it is a lot better. I ended up paying, but really wish that I refused to pay. At the time I was angry, but I let it go, because I thought with a quick deep conditioning treatment it would be okay. After spending lots of money to correct it I wish I demanded my $70 plus dollars back. I strongly believe I would have gotten refund. \u00a0 Karina may be a senior stylist and \"Deva Certified\" but she needs A LOT more education when it comes to curly hair. She needs to understand hair and not parrot what the large beauty companies say about their product.I do not like mention specific people in my reviews, unless it is positive, but I had such a bad experience and spent so much money to correct my hair I just had to get it out.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 4, 15]}, "30": {"description": "I had to write this review as I had the best experience today at Toujours and came home with a fantastic haircut and color.I had done a little bit of research before booking my appointment, looking on Yelp for a great salon that would suit me and had good positive reviews, I already knew about Toujours as I follow them on Facebook but I finally took the chance with them from the yelp reviews and I am so glad I did.

It is a comfortable sitting area, surrounded by mouth watering hair care products, on clean shelves, current magazines that aren't falling apart, near a reception area where the assistants sitting there do not talk about what they ate for dinner last night, who they're mad at, or who is late. It was noticed and appreciated. First class!After being greeted by your stylist, you then collaborate about what you are trying to achieve with your hair. I was offered smart color options and simple yet fresh styling, and 90 minutes later me and my massaged temples, conditioned locks, and chestnut colored hair walked onto Clark street feeling like a model...from the neck up anyway.

So, much in need of thinning out my helmet-esque-looking-mop, I made an appt and was scheduled to be seen by owner/senior stylist Rosa.Everything was lovely - the salon is clean, the front desk super helpful and nice, the decor is modern and inviting. But, holy sticker shock, shit! When I did the research into RJ's prices, I saw mens cuts for $35 and womens for $45. Now, I have short, short hair. Like a man. Man hair on my female body. So, one would assume I'd fall somewhere between the $35 and $45 price range. \"That'll be $65,\" the friendly front dude said to me. I almost fell over. With a $15 tip, I spent $80 on something I assumed (sigh) would only cost about $40.Yes, I realize Rosa is the owner and a senior stylist (senior stylists = more $$$ than junior stylists, generally.) And, yes, she used nothing but scissors on my hair (versus some of the younger, less-experienced stylists I've been to lately who use buzzers) and it came out pretty dang great. And, yes, she offers free touch-ups so when my neck hair is longer than it should ever be, I can go back and get a quick fix for zero dinero.But, I'm still kinda blown by the price. No where on the website does it say it will cost that much, AND, I'm so against charging women more than men for haircuts \u00a0- it's just stupid and sexist. I should be able to walk into any salon where men get the same cut as I do, and pay the same price as they do. There is no difference between my disconnected 'do and his.

She was kind and personable, and the only reason I'm giving the salon two stars instead of one.Unfortunately for me, the stylist was either rushed, or inexperienced, and I ended up with a color that not only was NOTHING like I asked for, but a color that I really, really do not like. And before a business trip. AND after asking three times prior to starting the color process, \"Are you SURE you can get me the color I'm looking for...?\" \"Yes\", I was told each time.Very, very disappointed.Here's the summary:1. I walk in and say, \"do you have time for a cut and color? If not the color - I definitely don't want to rush that- I'll just take the cut.\" One stylist declines and the other says she'll do it. I DOUBLE check again, \"are you sure you have time to do the color now?\" Yes, I'm assured she does. Great! 2. I point to two pictures in a magazine that showcase the two colors in which I'm interested. We narrow it down to the dark blonde, which I'm super psyched about. I ask, \"Are you sure we can get this color today?\" Yes. 3. I trust her and let her do her thing. Fast forward to her blow drying my hair. It is _bright orange_. It is not \u00a0blonde, or any shade of that, it is ORANGE hair. Literally. 4. My face is completely shocked, obviously conveyed to stylist, because she says, \"is something wrong?\"5. \"Um, yes, my hair is orange.\" She looks concerned, somewhat uncomfortable, and picks up the magazine again. \"Hmmm. Yeah. Well here let me tone it down with some toner shampoo.\"6. \"That will give me the color we talked about that we are looking at in the magazine?\" \"Um yeah, it'll be like that. It should.\" 8. \"So I'll walk out with the color in the picture based on what you are telling me you're about to do?\" I am not an expert, so I am completely relying on her expertise here, remember. \"Um, yeah.\" She says.9. She puts more stuff on my hair, lets it sit, and we rinse it out. It is STILL orange. She looks awkwardly at me and I just stare at the awful mess that is my hair. I feel bad, because she is a nice girl, but I am completely disappointed with the experience and pretty upset that I did not walk out of the salon with the hair color I wanted and was assured I would get. Moreover, I have ORANGE hair, which is one of my least favorite hair colors, personally. 10. She knows she completely messed up and says, \"I'll only charge you for the cut. We can make another appointment with a master colorist assisting to get what you want.\" While she was nice, I am thinking, \"I just paid my babysitter three hours to watch my kids, to waste my afternoon, to walk out of here with a color I both did not request and \u00a0am completely not happy with.\" I appreciate her offer, but I feel like more that just a promise of making it better - at full price for a mistake that you made- was not enough. And they couldn't even fit me in until a week after I got back from my trip. Make an exception when it's your mistake maybe....?Because I was headed on a business trip with colleagues, I could not wait until I returned to fix my colossal wreck of a head. I was able to get to get into another salon the next evening to correct what they could, but because it was such a horrible color to begin with, they could only to so much in one sitting to make the orange palatable. $150 to fix Robert Jeffrey's mistake.So, I wasted three hours at Robert Jeffrey to get a base of orange when asked for dark blonde, and wasted $150 to correct as much as I could at another salon, and STILL have to go back to process my hair again at Robert's and pay full price to again fix their mistake??Crazy.I don't have a problem spending the necessary dollars to get a result I want and am promised. I have a problem double paying to fix the mistake of someone else.Hopefully, when I go in and talk to them today, they'll be able to right their wrong.Keep you updated.

I brought multiple pictures to Alexandra. I have very curly, thick, red hair. That said, it will do what you want it to when handled correctly. Alexandra took over 2 hours to straighten it the night before my wedding. An expert stylist can do this in about 30-40 minutes. It got frizzy immediately. No hold, whatsoever. But I tried not to worry, it was August in Chicago. Things happen. Unfortunately, the pictures from my rehearsal dinner prove it. I was unimpressed, but too happy/busy/tired to worry about it. My 5 bridesmaids and I arrived the next day, and even though my hair was straight (just needed some going over), all 5 of them were done and dusted with beautiful up-do's before I was. It was about 2 hours in when I really started to panic and my maid of honor looked at me and said, \"here, have some chocolate\" and handed me a glass of champagne. She's a champ. I asked how much longer, and the frazzled stylist scoffed and kept going.Probably the worst part of the experience was that Alexandra did the EXACT same style 3 times, completely the same, and it never worked. It was a fish tail, and my hair is too heavy. I had mentioned I wouldn't mind a braid but that I wanted a curly, romantic look. Not my vision at all. She was clearly frustrated and panicking. Luckily, Rosa finally stepped in (looking worried and annoyed) and churned out a great up-do in about 20 minutes (exactly what I had envisioned), as that was all the time I had and the other 5 girls were finished. While it looked beautiful, and I am FOREVER grateful that she saved the day, there were a few strands that fell out later in the day :( That said, the up-do's she did for my bridesmaids as well as myself did look beautiful and I'm confident with more time everything would have stayed in place. She was a god send that day, but I just wished she had intervened sooner.To boot, when I initially inquired about bridal hair and then when I booked the appointments, I was told that the bridesmaids would all get 20% off as first time customers. None of them did, and I was too frazzled and trying to remain calm to ask until later in the day. I e-mailed the salon and no one ever gotten back to me. Brides, unless you book with Rosa, run. This place wasted not only my money, but the worst thing of all is that they wasted my time. Alexandra was very inexperienced. I can deal with that when you don't do the same thing that doesn't work over and over and hope for the same result. While Rosa stepped in, it was very, very late in the appointment. In addition, they did not honor their word and even charged me full price for the terrible service I received the morning of my wedding, knowing full well that it was not okay.

I am one of those people that likes to know what's in things that I eat, and if you're description does not include boiled vegetables DON'T add them to my tostada that should be nice and crunchy! With that said....the \"shell\" the tostada came on was so soggy that after removing the boiled vegetables, I had to fold it in half and it tasted as stale as stale can be! The only redeeming things from my order were the rice, despite not being $2 worth in size, and the horchata. The delivery guy was a joke too, acting as if he can't speak English when his accent is more Chicago than mine, really dude? Just too lazy to ring the doorbell and walk up the stairs! Sorry but I definitely WON'T be ordering from here again! I would much rather order from El Ranchito where you may get a stomach ache but at least they deliver it hot and made correctly!....

There is a decorative balcony on one wall, interesting pictures, and even some old tools on the walls. The ambiance is okay.It took a couple minutes for us to get water, chips, etc., after we sat down. Certainly it wasn't because the place was so busy. Actually, it was pretty quiet, maybe only 3 other tables occupied. And I was hungry and thirsty.Along with the chips, we got two containers of salsa, one red, one green. They also gave us a small bowl of beans, which I really liked better than the salsas. That was a nice touch that I hadn't seen before.They do have a luncheon menu, which I also liked. Why pay the bigger dinner dollars, right?I ordered enchildas suizas with a cheese fillling. You definitely get a generous amount. There were 3 enchildas, with rice and beans. However, I have to say that the food was not that hot, and I mean temperature. Usually the server says, be careful, the plate is hot (meaning it's been microwaved). Not this time! The food was warm, not hot. It looked as if all the cheese hadn't melted. Did I do anything about it? No, I was hungry, and I chowed down. It was good, but nothing spectacular.My friend Mary O. ordered Bistec Mexicana. It looked like enough food to serve Santa Ana's army, but she was really hungry, too. She said it was delicous, but very spicy. (She had been forewarned about the spiciness, so no fault to the server there). She really liked it, but she had to blow her nose about every third bite, and eat the tortillas to absorb the heat. Again, she really liked it, just was a little blown away by the heat. Well, it was a miserably cold day after all, and having clear sinuses in February can be a good thing.I expected to have a check brought around eventually, but that never happened.

I have tried multiple times to like this store or be impressed by their selection or staff and have come up sorely disappointed each time. Let's start with their selection. It makes no sense and doesn't seem to be governed (or arranged) by reason. I could not find the majority of the authors I was looking for (such as Le Guin, Barrie, and Lennox) but then turned the corner to find titles such as Twilight. :/ Really? Twilight? I don't think I've ever seen a modern fiction series so inherently sexist and damaging. Yet it is offered here? In calling yourself 'Women & Children First\", you are inherently making a judgment call and signifying that *your* books will be more accessible and suited for women and children. You also suggest that you will possess books that are less exclusionary and sexist. The Faludi books they had were, for some reason, cataloged under women and gender studies. You do her a great disservice by not placing her in politics where she belongs. She is an author who writes about politics and criticizes politics, government, and popular media. Their ecology section possessed no ecofeminist authors of note and was instead a hodgepodge of uninformed backyard theorists with no discernible experience or knowledge in or of ecology. You won't find many good children's and young adult titles here either. But, rest assured, there is plenty of smut. Sigh. Then there is the staff. Unfriendly every time I have gone in with my little sister and nieces. The only time I have gotten even remotely good service is when I went with my female friend and my girlfriend. Each time, a (presumably) lesbian attendant materialized right behind us upon the moment of entry to be overly attentive and creepy. Ignore the fact that I was clearly *with* my girlfriend and mull this over. This should be a safer space for women to shop without being leered at or creeped on like they could do at any other store. Again, your NAME implies this should be a less uncomfortable type of place for them. My mind is literally boggled by this place. Quite honestly, it seems as if it some self-satisfied second-waver's half-assed attempt at being 'inclusive'. But it fails miserably and the only thing they offer here that is different from other book stores is higher prices and a mostly female staff. A thoroughly disgusting place that has disappointed me this entire year.

To follow, we shared the mussels and mac n' cheese. Both were a hit, the mussels for one was definitely enough for us to share. While tasty, the dish was extremely salty and the bread that accompanied the dish was too hard to eat. These are basically my only complaints about Hopleaf. Mac n' cheese was creamy, tasty, and super rich. I highly recommend sharing a bunch of things so you can try multiple items!Overall, Hopleaf lived up to the hype.

If you want to go on a first date (or 100th date), grab a truly nice lunch or dinner, grab a beer with friends, get drunk with friends, or wander in alone at 1pm on a Thursday looking for salted meats, Hopleaf will not disappoint. I met Mark (he cuts the meat at Hopleaf) last week. Turns out that he lives across the street from me (small world) in Ravenswood and told me I have to go try the Charcuterie at Hopleaf. Thanks for the baller tip Mark. Does anyone else know the feeling of being \"in\" a meal? That's my test for how the meal was. Was I \"in\" it? Were the flavors, textures, ambiance, service and drink so wonderfully harmonized that I was able to escape this temporary and mundane existence by going \"in?\" Oh yes, I was \"in\" this Charcuterie experience all right, and I hope one day you get to dive in too. Just make sure that you don't eat for at least 30 minutes before entering the beer soaked waters. I asked my server, who was perfect by the way, to please have the kitchen choose which 3 meats I would try. (Note: Just start doing this guys, it makes SO much sense.) I, however, chose Three Floyd's Zombie Dust (they have it on draft people!) as my drink of choice. I thought it would pair quite well. I was quite right. For my board, the kitchen selected Tonno Di Maiale (olive oil cured in ham), the Pork Belly Rillette and sliced duck (it was off menu, and I forgot exactly what it was called). The presentation was beautiful, the portions perfect and the tastes all grabbed my shirt collar. Even the mustard was good. The Tonno Di Maiale was so tender and just the right amount of salty that I almost ordered more. Good lord was it good on toasted baguette with mustard and a quail egg. The pickled beats were also a nice addition. NOT TO BE MISSED are the white wine mussels. They are very good (although freshness/flavor fluctuates) but the sauce at the bottom is so god damn good I don't even know what to do sometimes.

I have been coming to Calo's for over 20 years. \u00a0Many for special occasions, such as birthdays. This past Friday I took a friend for his birthday there and was looking forward to a great experience. When we arrived our reservation was not recorded properly so we had to wait. I will say they were very quick in accommodating us and this was appreciated. I have always had exceptional service here and if I could rate that separately I would give it 5 stars. They are always friendly and know what they are doing. The problem with this visit and the last several has been the taste and quality of the food. I know Calo's is much busier than when I first started going. I am thinking that maybe kitchen has not been able to keep pace with the growth of customers and turnover of tables.After a cocktail we started off with my favorite, the fried calamari. The order came out and it seemed to me that the portion was less and it was warm at best. For the main course, my friend ordered one of my favorites the BBQ full slab of ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and the minestrone soup. His soup was bland and he mentioned it to me after the first bite. I accepted a taste and agreed with him. With this being his first visit I was disappointed as I was looking for him to have a great dining experience. I ordered the salmon special, baked potato, and salad. In a nutshell here is how I would describe the dishes: My salmon was cooked okay, a bit on the underdone side, which is okay because if needed I can always ask to cook a little more. It was a good size portion but not very flavorful. The baked potato was over-cooked and small sized for a restaurant. My salad was okay, not like they used to have, a big salad with lots of veggies in it. My friend enjoyed his ribs although when I tasted one, I thought they were over-cooked and dry. His mashed potatoes came to the table cold.

We found parking right in front (though I believe they have a lot across the street). We took a look inside before we made up our mind. The menu suited our tastes but what truly sealed the deal was, that for a Tuesday night, every table in the dining room was filled with loyalists and eclectics alike. Don't get me wrong, we sat within minutes; the time we did spend waiting for a table afforded us the opportunity to chat with Victor (the founder's son). This guy should run for office! A consummate gentleman who made us feel just as proud of the legacy his family created as he was. My daughter's ears perked up and may have even learned a lesson or two about tradition. Noting it was our first visit, Victor checked on our table after we sat down, and even sent over some prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella to welcome us into his \"second home.\" This guy is a class act and the main reason I chose to come home and sing the restaurant's praises on yelp.Ok. Ok. The food. We each had house salads, the grilled octopus (Polipo Griglia) and the Rigatoni Alla Barese (Italian sausage, chicken, asparagus and roasted red peppers in a zesty tomato, garlic and olive oil sauce). I actually ate less than I wanted to just so I could eat it again for lunch tomorrow. My daughter had buttered noodles (I know, kinda lame) but she finished her plate and scarfed down a miniature chocolate cake within minutes of its placement on our table.

Their ice cream tastes so good. They have so many flavors! Their sundaes are so childishly sinful and delicious. BUT ..... but, every single time, without fail, both my boyfriend and I feel unbelievably sick after eating their ice cream. Like, TMI sick. Get it? Immediate punishment. This is no good!I went here with 2 of my aunts once and they immediately commented on the old milk smell in the parlor and it is so true. There is a SMELL for sure in here. It's stale milk and refrigerator smell. It's so bad that you can smell it OUTSIDE the parlor, leaking through the door. It's nauseating. Am I getting sick because their ice cream is old, bad, spoiled, not stored at the proper temperature? I don't know. I will say many times the ice cream has been basically dripping melting the second they put it on a cone. Maybe they aren't keep their cooler/fridges at the right temp.An even bigger complaint than getting continually sick from their ice cream and a sign that something huge is wrong with their refrigerators is the taste of their refrigerated treats/baked goods. \u00a0One day I wanted some chocolate, not ice cream, and I remember George's has some such items along with cake and what not. I purchased a small baggie of foam candy, I think it's called Devil's food candy in some parts. It's caramelized foamy sugar in chunks, covered in chocolate. The sugar is delicious and dissolves in your mouth, or so it is supposed to. I got these bad boys home and took one bite and could not eat anymore. The taste of old fridge had so intensely permeated these treats that I could not eat another bite and threw them away. How old are these candies? When were they made? If they are fresh, when is the last time you cleaned out your fridge units?!??!?! With a taste like that I am absolutely 100% certain that absolutely all of their candies, cakes, chocolates also taste like fridge. And because this parlor continually smells stale I have to confidently assume their baked goods and treats ALWAYS taste like old, stale fridge. The taste was so god awful inedible, old and terrible. Yikes. I was so close to going back to return these disgusting treats but I just let it go because I didn't feel like losing it in public and yelling at hipsters about chocolate.

It's been a busy summer, so I don't get to go as much as I'd like to, but the 2 times I've been so far, I've stopped at the Videnovich Farms stand, and both times it was my favorite vendor to stop at. I believe the person at the stand is Vera, and she's just awesome. She's a very personable person, she's quick with a smile, and she seems to really enjoy letting people know about her farm, the vegetables, and, the most interesting part, the yarn. Her farm has sheep and she creates skein's of wool that she hand-spins. She leaves the wool in its natural shades, and it's amazing the variety of shades the wool naturally comes in. She also dyes some of them using flowers, plants, etc, creating beautiful colors. Another great thing about Vera's stand are the smells! She's got cinnamon basil, lavender, and other things that smell so good. I felt like I was transported to the farm in Michigan. Part of what I enjoy about going to my local farmers' market is the opportunity to socialize and to interact with vendors. Vera, of Videnovich Farms, really seems to have quite a flair for talking with market goers with a friendly demeanor and a knack for providing information about her wares. I'm definitely thinking about buying some beautiful yarn from Vera and making a scarf, or giving a skein of yarn to a knitter-friend. I definitely recommend checking out her stand, at least to experience the evocative scents, or even a little chat, and, who knows, maybe you'll even end up taking home some lavender, yarn, or a pepper.", "rating": "4", "date": [2010, 7, 22]}, "23": {"description": "Hump Day only gets better during Andersonville summers.

This is really wonderful especially for people who work full-time during the week. This market features a myriad of produce items, many kinds of breads and excellent meat vendors. This Farmer's Market features a rotation of vendors (merchants), which s a great way to give new vendors an opportunity to participate every other week. You will see items, such as, baked goodies and fresh real fruit jams. Due to the \"rotation\" of vendors (merchants) you may not see a specific vendor the following week. One vendor that I was very happy to see this year was \"Black Garlic North America\" which offers aged, fermented garlic which has a sweet, delicate taste and balances most dishes perfectly. I love using this garlic in different meats as well as using it sparingly in salads, grilled salmon or broiled Talapia. I also purchased some organic vegetables and fruits. I even found corn, which is very hard to find at a Farmer's Market. Picked up a few ears for my husband who loves corn on the cob. This Farmer's Market is open through October 15, 2014 and every Wednesday from 3 to 7 pm. Gotta love it!Due to \"space\" this is not a huge Farmer's Market, however, it has some wonderful items. I like the size of this market, because it doesn't take long to get through the entire market and hit up most of the vendors here. I have been to many, many Farmer's Market over the years and most close by early afternoon. On the other hand, this Farmer's Market is open until 7 or 8 pm (depending upon the day of the week and time of month). This year the market opened two-weeks early, which was very exciting for those of us who enjoy a great Farmer's Market. There are nearly 30 vendors offering everything from fresh-cut flowers, wonderful bottles of wine to a myriad of cheese to honey and including fresh lamb, delicious ripe fruits and unique vegetables. If you enjoy tea in the fall and winter time (or year round) you must check out the gourmet tea vendors. There are pies, gourmet pasta sauce and unique salsas that you may not find any where else. I noticed some people brought their knives (yes, you heard correctly) -- knives -- and someone will sharpen your knives for FREE while you walk around the Farmer's Market and shop till you drop!I met Brady Bradine at the Farmer's Market. This is his fourth year being a vendor at the market. He sells all-natural, whole grain baked goods, which I can appreciate but can no longer eat. For example, Brady sells cookies, cupcakes, muffins and brownies from his bakery located in Oak Park, IL (it is called \"B True Bakery\"). I didn't purchase any items from the \"B True Bakery\" but my friend purchased a cupcake and cookie for her husband. I gave up sweets and anything that contains sugar, but I do admit my mouth was watering and everything looked fantastic and smelled super fresh. My friend rated the cupcake with 4-stars (as she ate it while we were walking around the market). Her husband enjoyed the cookie and said it was \"very, very good.\" He didn't rate the cookie. However, he inhaled the cookie very quickly so I will take this to mean that maybe the cookie was/is 4 or 5-star worthy.If you have not been to a Farmer's Market this Summer, get your ass over to Berwyn Avenue (between Clark and Ashland Avenue) and treat yourself. This is their sixth year. I love a good Farmer's Market, and appreciate that they also offer organic products that will not break your budget. I also appreciate that they accept credit cards, debit and LINK cards which makes it very convenient for everyone to shop at this Farmer's Market.

It's not big, and there isn't the variety of some markets, but to quote Spencer Tracy in \"Pat and Mike,\" what's there is cherce.What is there? Well, the usual rundown of fruits and veggies, of course. Apples are coming in, and the beloved honey crisps are everywhere. ($5/qt, which in my case was 7 apples, which is much better than The Jewels.) Though I'm a little put off by the winter squash. Too soon! But it's the non F&V stuff I tend to buy here. Great breads - if a little pricey - from Bennison's. Amazing fresh and aged cheeses from Brunkow Cheese in Wisconsin. They have a raw milk white cheddar and horseradish spread that is amazing. And an aged cheddar that is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. And you know there's a lot of competition there. Preserves from Rare Bird which include - are you sitting down? - strawberry chocolate. And so much more. Infused vinegars, herb rubs, fresh eggs, fresh pasta. Goat meat! Krsna, are you listening?Of course, most of this stuff isn't cheap. Sure, there are bargains like the tomatoes and apples, but the eggs are $4.50 a dozen. But a half pound of 6 year aged cheddar for 12 bucks is more satisfying than a pound and a half from Kraft for the same price. Go for it.The market must be doing well, because it has been extended until Oct. 7. (Originally, Sept 9 was going to be the last day.) Hours are now 3 to 7.

Now, there are some bad things about the market as well: *it gets massively crowded (especially after 5pm since the after work crowd starts arriving). *You could possibly get run over by a child or run on over in your rush to get to a booth. The kids are everywhere--so watch out. *The booths cannot be on the sidewalk, so it can be tough to maneuver around the market. Prepared to be jostled--that is the way it goes folks.

They had a very similar meatball taste, which I liked very much. \u00a0Love me some meatballs. \u00a0They were crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. \u00a0I have never had these before anywhere and will be ordering them again without question from herePeperone Ripieno - Stuffed Peppers, were stuffed and cooked to perfection. \u00a0I could have have eaten 2 of these easily, but I saved most of it for laterThe Arancini and Peperone Ripieno are so good that I cooked some pasta, reheated what was leftover, and they were better then the night before. \u00a0Nothing better then when leftovers taste better the next day.Panzerotti - Basically a fried Stromboli, but not many people in Chicago have heard of these. \u00a0I guess the pizza puff is similar, but I wouldn't know, never ordered one. \u00a0This wasn't the best I ever had, since I am from south jersey, the home of the original Panzerotti. \u00a0Ever in south jersey go here - yelp.com/biz/panzarotti-\u2026. \u00a0Yes it's in sh*t hole Camden NJ, but your mind will be blown. \u00a0Anyway back to the review - so this was good. \u00a0Nice and cruncy on the outside from being fried, but not very greasy.

Hamburger Mary's is only ok, Mary's Attic is TERRIBLE. Somehow though I keep coming back. Why?!The Problems I Have With Mary's Attic:- Drinks are BAD. Their \"Red Bull\" they serve tastes TERRIBLE. Their soda is usually flat. Yet, the drinks are priced incredibly high. Sure, the decor of the place is nice, but it's not worth paying for.- Soda is over $2.50, when in most bars they don't charge for just a soda. Now, I realize no one is entitled to free soda in a bar, but $2.50 when draft beer starts at $3.00?! What's even worse is NO free refills! Why free refills downstairs, but not upstairs in the bar?! I'm sure they just pocket the \"refill money\" in the tip jar and we just don't know about it. Way to treat a customer who would love to drink, but just can't because of medication. - Food menu upstairs is VERY small, and actually none of the good things of the menu made it to the upstairs menu. Tell the bartenders you want to order food at your own risk, they get mad!- RIDICULOUS $15 minimum for credit/debit cards. VERY unfriendly about this policy.- Staff. Excluding one male bartender who is very friendly, most of the staff is strangely unfriendly. Did no one notice this during their interviews? I once arrived there fifteen minutes before the kitchen closed. When I went downstairs and asked to sit down the host told me to just head upstairs and order something upstairs. We went upstairs and noticed the food looked terrible, but we were too hungry to go back downstairs and argue with the host. We tried to order food from the bartender upstairs and she went off on us telling us the kitchen closed in fifteen minutes and we should have arrived sooner because the kitchen was going to get mad at her. I told her what happened with the host downstairs, and that we were incredibly hungry and people in our group hadn't eaten all day, so we weren't taking no for an answer when last call for food was still 15 minutes away. She informed us it wasn't her problem, and only decided to take the order after we said we were going to leave. Mix that in with their bad attitude towards credit/debit cards, they talk to you like idiots when you pull one up. Ridiculous.- Karaoke. Terrible sound system. Contstantly a long wait even when the bar is dead since they let people who turn in songs after us go before us. It's really annoying.- Jenga. If I have to listen to one more crash of Giant Jenga I may lose my mind.The worst situation I've had happened on a very busy night. Because of the credit/debit card $15 minimum they make you start a tab when you are under the minimum. Because I'm used to paying for each drink I have indiviually, I left the bar at the end of the night forgetting to pick up my credit card. I called them the next morning and they told me to pick it up around 2pm. At 2pm I traveled to Mary's to find out they not only lost my card, but they gave it to another customer that didn't even have a name similar to mine, and had a blue card when I had a silver one. The owner of Mary's came out to tell me it was a friend of his and not to worry because his friend wouldn't use my card. Why they didn't tell me over the phone I do not know, but they told me the other customer was going to drop off my card after work, so I could stop back later in the night to get my card.When I came back later in the night to get my card I found out that not only did they give my card to the other customer, but they charged his $75 bar tab on my car, when my tab was only around $15. I told the owner to cancel the transaction, knowing full well that he could because I have worked in restaurants before, but the owner refused. He said it was too much work and told me he'd just give me gift cards. He was extremely unprofessional,, and just too lazy to help me out. Seriously, who has $75 to just waste, \u00a0apparently he does, or thought I do! After arguing for a while I agreed to the gift cards, but warned him that I did put a hold on my account anyway, and that the charge might not clear. He told me to call him back if and when the charge went through, and he'd give me the $75 in gift cards then. I called and left several messages to let them know that I was charged, but never recieved a single gift card. I hope whoever had my card is grateful for the $75 in drinks I bought for them! Seriously, what a lazy owner, and what a bad bartender who can't even give someone the right card back when it's a little busy. Worst experience in a restaurant/bar I've EVER had.In conclusion, I'll probably still end up coming back to karaoke since my friends like it, but everytime I show up I'll ask myself \"Why Am I Here?!\". If you're looking for a restaurant it's worth a trip downstairs. Avoid the upstairs bar though, and hit a bar down the street.

Yes, I'm a straight girl who went with another straight friend to Sunday Karaoke Night at a gay bar.2. I have been to many gay bars in the past and have found them to be welcoming and, well, a blast!3. A bitch is a bitch, no matter the gender.A couple of Sundays ago, I had a friend in town who loves karaoke. We decided to scope out the \"school night\" karaoke scene in Chicago (though this was Labor Day weekend and not technically a school night) and after perusing the slim pickin's came across Mary's. We were excited to read the overall positive reviews.I don't know what these people have been drinking or smoking, but I want some, because this is up there in my top 10 crappy bar experiences. First, my friend, the polite southerner, asked a male if she could use the extra book at his table. Apparently this was the only straight dude in the whole place, and his larger than life, puffing hildebeest of a girlfriend assumed my friend was hitting on him. So we got the stink-eye all night from said girlfriend and her entourage of equally frightening, snuffling, and gargantuan buddies.Second, it took about 3 hours for my friend's name to get called. I do realize it was a busy karaoke night--fine. Understood. We can be patient...under normal circumstances. This fine night, however, we were treated to DJ Axel inserting himself into the line-up every 4 songs, and overall being a bitchy queen to my friend. We even witnessed him moving her name down in the pile.Third, the crowd. I realize that the venue has no control over the kind of people that patronize it. However, the immediate vibe upon walking in here was that of a high school cafeteria. Both my friend and I are friendly, outgoing, and approachable people. But God forbid we tried to engage strangers in conversation. WTF? We're not trying to convert your man to \"our team,\" nor are we hitting on your girlfriend! Insecure much?The nicest folks could be found outside smoking, where all cliques dissolved and people magically spoke to one another. This is where Mary's gets a star back. These were the people who cheered for my friend once she got on stage.I will be back to the actual restaurant because it's delicious.

Not only that, but the ATM is located on the exterior of the building and in the winter time that proves to be very, very inconveniencing. Personally I think that anyplace that requires a minimum for a credit card in this day and age can't afford to pay the fees associated with said machines and should just go all cash.Other than that, this bar is a nice escape, especially if I want to stay in the neighborhood.Cheers!", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 10, 5]}, "20": {"description": "I came here to see a friend perform last night.

Just wow. \u00a0At this level of quality and care, it's an absolute steal. \u00a0If you live in Andersonville, or honestly within 50 miles of Andersonville, you have got to go here! \u00a0It is by far some of the best sushi I've eaten across the country and with the level of standards they bring to every aspect of the dining experience, you just could not possibly be disappointed. \u00a011/10 stars. \u00a0Truly perfection.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 4, 9]}, "21": {"description": "This place is fantastic!

And not one that could be satisfied by the seafood/sushi counter at Jewel. Or Whole Foods' love for brown rice in their sushi rolls. I wanted the real stuff. The only thing that would able to satisfy this craving is a huge, signature maki roll where you can almost not see the white rice because the roll is topped with an abundance of other goodies/fishies. But even still, it's definitely made with white rice. I'm all about the white rice guys.My friend and I headed to Ora on Friday night at about 9:45 PM for a late, late dinner. Since both of us returned from separate vacations where we both had the habit of ordering too much to eat, we decided to scale back just a little bit - we ordered the Dynamite Specialty Maki roll and a Spicy Salmon roll. BAM! The Dynamite Roll was amazing!! Tbh, I can't remember everything that it had in it, but whatever covered the top of the roll (maybe scallops?) was delicious. The roll came with 5 pieces, so it's definitely a little pricey for sushi, but well worth it. The roll was great and both my friend and I agreed that we hadn't had anything like it before. The spicy salmon roll, although may appear to be a normal selection, was also great. The pieces were pretty large in comparison to other spicy salmon rolls I've ordered and was pretty good.

There were grits that were beyond amazing. The cocktail list is pretty short - would like to see a few more options. there were a couple vegetarian options, so i was pretty full after leaving, which is always a good sign.Cons: SERVICE. To me, service is the hardest thing to get right, as there is such a delicate balance between coming over too frequently and never showing up. We went as a party of four, and when we were seated, we were told we were a large party (four people???) and that it was highly recommended we should order appetizers and main dishes NOW and they'd course it out for us. PET PEEVE. There were quite a few apps we wanted to try, and by the time we worked our way through, half of us didn't even want to eat a main dish. Now, what exactly would have happened if we had ordered our food in advance? Our server was also training another server, which is nice to see - but I also hope the server in training noticed the number of times we had to signal for our to come over rather than her naturally come check on us.I would come back here again, as it's in the neighborhood, and I am still dreaming about those grits days after the fact, but might consider sitting at the bar, as people at the bar always looked like they were well looked after.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 5, 27]}, "54": {"description": "LOVE this place!

When the waitress came with a platter of all the deserts they offered, my BF chose the tiramisu. 7 min later she came back and said they actually don't have any tiramisu. She offered something else and at that point we just really didn't care for desert and asked her for the check. She came back with the check and insisted we take a brownie to go.

A server was finally assigned to our table and began to take our order. That is, until I asked about an item on the menu, and the server didn't know how to describe the preparation of the item excusing himself never to return.3.

I went back to the table to wait. 5.SURPRISE --- A new server arrived at our table without our pre-ordered drinks or appetizers. He told us that he would be replacing our server and would need to take our order. Felling like I was in the twilight zone, I said, \"um, we already ordered with the previous server and we have been waiting a very long time\". He seemed confused; why does that surprise me. He apologized and left us all sitting at the table wondering what was going on. I was ready to leave and go to Calo Ristorante across the street. My friends said to give the place a chance. Unfortunately, we stayed making the most of the bad service. 6. Moving on--About 10 minutes after the new server left us, he returned to our table with our drinks. The drinks were incorrect and so they needed to remake two. 7. Finally, our appetizers arrived, and the drinks issues were resolved-- Yippie!!! \u00a0The main meals came shortly after the drinks and appetizers. 8. More problems-- Go figure! My order was improperly made; the manager was called over again, and the food was sent back to the kitchen. My friend, ordered a simple burger MED - she received a burger that was way under-cooked and bright red. She had to eat around the uncooked meat. The manager was notified again, he said he would speak to the cook about the problem. The sad part about this entire ordeal is that the manager did not comp her burger after seeing the food preparation; nor, did he comp my meal considering all that had occurred. Instead, the manager offered ME one free drink, and a free birthday moose. I guess asking me what item I would have liked was not in the cards. 9. Sadly, the \u00a0initial bill for dinner was around $220 including 20% tip. I know, I don't know why I gave the server a reasonable tip considering the service and such. The second bill was for only drinks, and it \u00a0was about $130.00 including tip (approximately that amount). \u00a0Some b-day party!

He was clearly too busy talking with one particular customer to even bother greeting us. Once we finally were greeted and given a menu, we waited another 15 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, and eventually *left to smoke a cigarette*. Right in front of the building.

A few menu items like the tomato soup and hummus taste as if someone does care about the food they're putting out, and the fried pickles and fried tomatoes get a pass mostly because they're, well, fried. But the flavors and presentation of the burgers are fairly blah. Especially the veggie burger: two hard, bland frozen patties out of a box. And if they're not frozen? Yikes. As for the video games: great idea. It'd be even better if they all worked. And why are the video games free but the pinball machines take a dollar?

The Bagel gives you free bagel chips but here they charge $2.50. I got the last bag of bagel chips. The soup was very good. The matzo ball tasted like what I make at home. The chopped liver did not have any flavor, way too much schmaltz and not enough liver. But what made this a really bad visit was the poor customer service and the argument that followed. When I put the chopped liver on the bagel chips the chips in the bag were mostly cinnamon flavored and the others were burnt. I was told there was an assortment of chips in the bag but there were many burnt chips and many with cinnamon but none that would go well with the chopped liver. I told the person I would need a bagel because there were no chips in the bag that would go with the chopped liver. When I got the bill I was charged for a chopped liver sandwich, a bagel and a bag of chips. I asked the person to remove the charge for the bagel because I was being charged for the chopped liver sandwich and they would not do it because they told me the owner said they were to charge me for the bagel because I told them I did not want it. Had the chips been good I would not have wanted the bagel. But I needed the bagel because the chips would not go well with the chopped liver. Since I was being charged for a chopped liver sandwich I was entitled to the bagel even if it was served on the side. They told me the owner would not come to the register to speak with me.

I'm sorry, that's not acceptable. \u00a0If you don't have what the customer asks for, you find out what they want as a substitute. \u00a0Hot dog bun wouldn't have been at the top of my list by any stretch. \u00a0The CB itself was fine, though no great shakes in the flavor department. \u00a0It came with a small tub of potato salad which wasn't bad, though there was something odd in the dressing, some herb or spice that I wasn't nuts about. \u00a0That's not an issue; everyone's taste in potato salad is different. \u00a0It also came with two very nice pickles which were actually the best thing about the sandwich.I ordered kishke with gravy because I dearly love it. \u00a0This stuff was nothing to write home about and the gravy was not only gelatinous but so salty it proved inedible. \u00a0Clearly it had been made with some kind of flavoring and the chef used too much of it because the gravy was so dark it was nearly black and had a commercial flavor under all that salt. \u00a0Total wash.The potato knish dough was crumbly dry, the filling meager and pretty flavorless. \u00a0not a total wash but nothing to get excited about. \u00a0The matzoh soup which I got for supper and to make up the $20 minimum for delivery, is okay, but the matzoh ball is one of those light, fluffy, flavorless ones. \u00a0Me, I like the cannonball type. \u00a0While I'm not thrilled with the soup, it's decent and will make a decent dinner along with the rest of the knish.The delivery cost me $6 and was more than half an hour late. \u00a0I did get a call saying they'd be late, so I appreciated that.Basically what you've got here is fair to poor food at a rather high price point. \u00a0I won't be ordering from them again and that makes me sad because I wanted to like this place, I really did. \u00a0My best friend gave it four stars! \u00a0I love deli! \u00a0But I can't afford to spend this much to have so-so food delivered.ETA: I ate the rest of the knish today and discovered that it was a meat knish.

However, as I don't want to be limited to a time-consuming commute whenever I need a great mani-pedi, I decided to expand my mind to trying another place. I chose 2x10 based on the fact that it was named Chicago's Best of 2014 and was apprehensive after checking out the reviews.The truth? 2x10 is a good nail salon. Let me tell you why.I called ahead about two hours for an appointment, which seems like it might be essential on weekends. During the hour I was there they were extremely busy and kept getting walk-ins, most of whom they told to come back later in the day. I arrived a little early for my appointment and was welcomed right away. They offer a broad selection of OPI and Essie polishes and even do waxing, which I didn't experience but is nice to know.My technician, Yuna, was finishing up a mani when I arrived, so I waited a while for her in the massage chair with my feet soaking, which I didn't mind. Yuna did very good work, which included satisfying foot, hand and shoulder massages. \u00a0She did not rush the process at all and asked me whether I wanted my nails trimmed or filed, what shapes I wanted, etc. The service was nearly faultless, and I'd definitely recommend coming here if you want a good mani-pedi at a good price ($40).Where 2x10 falls short is in atmosphere and presentation. The space is very small and the dark brown decor makes it feel cavelike and drab. My suggestion would be to whitewash the whole place (or choose a nice, clean light blue) and get rid of the vases and other decorative items that just add to the cluttered appearance. I think these small changes would do wonders in making the space feel larger and more modern. Also, I am not a fan of a TV in a nail salon -- it just adds to the noise. Today during my service the football game was on (with sound) and it detracted from the relaxing environment. No one seemed to be watching it.Also, many of the bottles of polish had paint all over the outside, and I think this looks a little sloppy. This is the first point of contact that the customer has with the salon, and I think presentation in this area is important. Is it better than ZaZaZoo? I have to say no. ZaZaZoo is more spacious and attractive, and the service is slightly better in little ways (they offer you a beverage during the service and a pedi includes a stone massage, for example).

How sad that I'm going in the opposite direction.Last night was the latest in a series of Yelp Chicago Gay Nights. I chose @mosphere for the event because of their widely advertised Sabbath Stripper Sunday, with $1 well drinks, $5 martinis, and male dancers at 9pm. Imagine my surprise when I walked in the door at 7 o'clock to discover that they were hosting a benefit for Season of Concern, featuring storytellers from Serendipity Theater. And imagine my combined embarrassment and annoyance when they started scolding us for being too loud.Now both of these are admirable organizations, and I can understand performers wanting some quiet and attention while they are working. And if had had any idea there were going to be storytellers at @mosphere, I would never have scheduled an event there. But at no time over the past month since Gay Night was planned was there any mention of a benefit on the same night. Their Midsommarfest schedule was clearly posted; this week's \"Club Manhunt\" has been up for weeks; even the weekly trivia contest is listed. But the \"please be quiet because people will be reading their stories\" event? Not a sign. This, in spite of the fact the @mosphere's website has an Events page, which links to their Google Calendar of scheduled events. Oops. The woman from Serendipity Theater did tell me that the information was posted on their website, as well as on the Season of Concern website. So if planned to have dollar drinks and strippers at Serendipity Theater, I would have been fully warned.About those dollar drinks. No dollar drinks. When I went to the bar, I saw the special listed as $3 drinks. When I asked the bartender about it -- the surly bartender who took his surly time getting to me, despite the fact that I was clearly the only person at the bar looking to get a drink -- he said, \"Oh yeah, we don't do that any more.\" To which I replied, \"Better change the website, then.\" Because it's up there, clear as day. On the freaking home page. To which he replied, \"It's on the website?\" *sigh* As it turns out, the $3 price is a tremendous discount from the regular $4 price. And if these drinks were any more than $4, I'd be finding another bar.At this point, you may be wondering why I even give @mosphere 3 stars.In the end, it all turned out okay. The stories ranged from okay to pretty good, and most people missed the worst one, which was the first one. By 9pm, we were allowed to talk and act like we were in a bar. About the same time, the nice bartender started working, which was a huge relief. And some time between 9 and 10 -- 9pm in gay time -- the strippers started working. Well, you can't really call them strippers, since they started as undressed as they were going to get, and you can't really call them dancers, because even if they wanted to dance, their platform is about the size of a coffee table. But they were all reasonably attractive and 2 of the 3 were actually friendly and in a bar like @mosphere, you take what you can get.

First, it should be known that I don't have a tolerance for long brunch waits. The longer the wait, the greater my expectations become, so I've mostly dined here on work-from-home weekdays. This means I'm a big fan of the lunch menu. The smoked chicken Asian salad may sound like an odd combo (smoked chicken in an Asian salad? huh?) but it's actually a great flavor combo. Friends have enjoyed their lunch items as well. But the thing all the yuppie masses rave about is the brunch, right? Well that's a different story....Why do people wait sometimes great lengths to dine here on the weekends? I don't know about you, by my Saturday and Sunday mornings are usually a hazy hangover that requires food and coffee and/or booze immediately, so time is of the essence. I can't wait 30 minutes to be seated, only to wait another 30 minutes for food, and then have it be short of amazing, so this is why I tend to avoid Bongo Room and like establishments. Basically, food has to be astonishing to justify such waits, and, for the brunch menu at least, I don't think that it is. Most recently, I had an omelette. It was kind of dry and not very flavorful. My boyfriend had a breakfast burrito, which was 90% egg and 10% whatever the other ingredients were, making it kind of boring. The blackberry grapefruit mimosa is rather delicious, however. Previously I've had a breakfast sandwich with housemade Italian turkey sausage...which was incredibly bland. A pancake dish was also not very impressive. Again, nothing is bad. Some things are really good, but most of the stuff I have is just fine. The atmosphere is sleek and modern and the service is friendly as well. Also, major bonus points for the check-in process - they take your name & mobile number. You receive a text message with a link to view your position in line, which also includes some coupons to area businesses to explore while you wait - a very nice touch! Once the table is ready, you can reply to confirm or cancel. WHY DOESN'T EVERY RESTAURANT HAVE THIS? It's amazing. I'll stick to going to Bongo Room when the lines are non-existent and the space isn't overly crowded. I think it's overhyped, and doesn't stack up against nearby options like Big Jones, which delivers delicious food AND takes reservations.

I also love their coffee, their decor, and their outdoor patio. This place is bustling on the weekends and even busy during the week. So why the 2 star review?It's tough...because the servers and bus boys are attentive and friendly. I have never had a bad experience with service. However, the front of house is a rude mess. I have had numerous bad experiences with a male host who never seems to be busy, but loves to ignore people waiting for his attention at the door. It definitely makes for a bad first impression and is really unwelcoming. If it weren't for the fact that I KNOW dealing with the rudeness is worth it once you get past the crappy, rude gatekeeper and get to enjoy the food...then I'm not sure I would ever go to Bongo Room. Most recently, I attempted to grab lunch with my wife at Bongo Room. It was early afternoon in the middle of the week, and we walked inside and stood in front of the host stand. My wife had ACL surgery just a week before, so she was on crutches with a large leg brace. Even though there was no wait and not much going on in the front of the house, the male host and who I assume to be the male manager, stood there finishing a conversation. They both obviously knew we were there since we were standing right in front of them, but there was no \"Just hold on one second\" or \"I'll be with you in just a minute.\" Instead, it was actually pretty awkward. We weren't acknowledged for a good minute or two, so we actually just turned around and left. There are too many good brunch places in Andersonville for anyone to put up with rudeness like that. I hope Bongo Room considers who they have working the host stand during the week and if they want that kind of first impression/representation.

Very clean and smooth going down, but still sportinig a rich and complex flavor. I also got to taste a Pilsner Doug was making, which was just as good as all the Czech ones I've tried, but without the slight bitterness or bite which is common in those. Again, being here with a bunch of brewmeisters impressed upon me the complexity of knowledge and technique required to make great beer. And Doug and Tracy do just that.

Halfway thru my 'express' pedicure I was informed that because I came in so late someone was going to start on my manicure while the pedi was wrapping up. I was okay with this, so I allowed the manicurist to begin. The manicure was much better than the pedicure. Very thorough and attentive. My nails looked awesome after.

This is the kinda place you wanna go treasure hunting in cuz some of it is dirty, but once you find something, you gotta have it. The prices stay true to the store's name too. Stuff is garage sale cheap, priced to sell. Don't even hesitate to bargain either. Saving a dolla always makes me holla.Anyway, I love the European family that runs it. The old man is great. His wife is sweet and his son is there on the weekends; he's got that rugged thing going on =d... I have been there enough times in the past to assume the old man works the weekdays and the son does it for shits and giggles (have you seen his car?) on the weekends while his old man is rummaging around or shooting the breeze outside.This is a sweet spot to explore and come back to cuz they always get new stuff. PS. For anyone that's wondered what is under that tarp in the way back, it's a Rolls Royce but he won't sell it.

First of all, delivery is $20, no matter how much stuff you get.

For instance, you can actually get a coffee table for $10, $20, or $40 bucks. Now, of course, the $10 is going to be sort of rickety and maybe have scratches. But sometimes, you just need a coffee table and are totally broke. But then there are also higher quality ones.I managed to get a cabinet/pantry that was just adorable, and it was $165. Like I said, all kinds of prices. The furniture is unique, and has character.This is truly a store for people like me who get mad just thinking of Ikea.Yay Elvis and his dad for running this awesome place!PS: Even though there were going to be closed on a Monday a couple of weeks ago, Elvis gave me his cell number, so I could simply come by with my \u00a0moving truck, and they would load up the cabinet/pantry I had bought.

Guess what: You're not as much fun as you think you are, and we're tired of it! \u00a0Grow up and act like an adult! \u00a0I have yet to see ANYONE who was acting responsibly removed from the bar at Cattle Call. \u00a0I would also like to take the opportunity to point out that the manager of Cattle Call is women!So what would I suggest for improvement? \u00a0The place is very long and expansive, and I think that intimidates some people. \u00a0People seem to flock to the sides of the bar where there railings and intimate corners; people like to have something to lean up against. \u00a0I think maybe finding a way to break up the west side of the space a bit might help. \u00a0Perhaps a railing along that side of the dance floor; that would both help prevent people on the sideline from drifting on to the dance floor, and give people a place to put their drink when they go out to dance. \u00a0Also, I would turn the music up just a touch. \u00a0I TOTALLY appreciate that the lower volume allows for actual conversation, but during the Wednesday Night Drag show, and on Friday and Saturday nights, the volume could be a little bit higher.Ultimately, I think this place has some solid potential and I believe they're still working out some kinks, but I'll keep coming back to see what they come up with next!", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 7, 6]}, "37": {"description": "Mark the bartender is totally hot and the BEST mixologist EVAR!", "rating": "5", "date": [2009, 7, 6]}, "0": {"description": "Some friends and I went here on a Saturday night and when we walked in, we were a little caught off guard. \u00a0The bar was empty. \u00a0As in no one was there except staff. \u00a0Granted, it was about 10:30 on a Saturday night but an empty bar? \u00a0Uh.......well we can't blame the bar on that one.The bartender that served us (Miguel?) was really really cool. \u00a0He engaged us in conversation, made us laugh, and (in my opinion) served up some pretty decent drinks. \u00a0It was $6 Absolut cocktail night, and he introduced me to the Absolut Acai Berry...now I'm hooked!Parking: \u00a0Be careful if you park on Ashland; the meters there are keyed until Midnight, and believe it or not we saw some meter people out right up until Midnight.I'll go back again. \u00a0Hopefully next time there will be some more people there.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 7, 7]}, "38": {"description": "what a nifty place an UPSCALE bar how fun is thatand a country feelhow tongue in cheekmoo!!!! wowo all fresh and smells so new and cleancan we say huggggggggggggggge \u00a0from the hot bartenders to the sexy gals who serve libations to the hot boiy behind the bars and what a nice placethere is a brand new dance floor i had to learn ettiquette so i could disco on the line dance floor what fun then i find out my freind anglique is one of the mngrs and and old freind michael and his partner micheal opened this high end place mike and i used to do musical theatre in the burbs way back when we both had lots of hair....hahahah and angelique as a mngr to over see she is the the new age house/bar momma she runs her house with a stern cattle prod she is the \u00a0nicest person in the world i just got to meet the other half micheal he is the other half of cattle call \u00a0he is so nice even gave me a free dance lesson to boot and now i hear they are hosting all kinds of community fund raisers too \u00a0 stop by this place is huge in a a few months \u00a0this have the rafter packed tot he ceiling of hot boys and eevn the gals are welcome too nice staff....too yummy martunies too i got snoockered....i cant wait to see one of the new shows on wed nites now i know my gal angelique is the co host alog with miss ashley yahooo put ur boots on......ps they have great videis too", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 7, 6]}, "27": {"description": "What happened?

The Call played some videos and tunes that were a little more obscure but still some of my favorites.The bar itself is very appealing - two different bar areas, a large dance floor and plenty of space to spread out. I say plenty of space because the place was pretty much dead. There were probably 10 people there at any given time (including our group of five). This could be a plus if you're looking for a quiet night out somewhere, but for us we were looking to sing loudly and act goofy so we felt a little uncomfortable belting out the tunes. We were also told that the drink special was three dollars off of martinis. We ordered some cosmos and dirties and the drinks were adequately strong and tasty. But the 7.50 price tag after the special didn't seem so special. Especially because there are many other Wednesday \u00a0night bar specials elsewhere that would only charge $5.

Always get the Saganaki. Always. There's nothing that can go wrong. You might lose an eyebrow, but it's still delicious. It's flaming cheese, after all. We ordered our entrees and continued munching on bacon wrapped dates (SO YUM) and the cheese. I should mention the bread basket was fresh and warm and awesome as well. Here's where it got a little sticky. I ordered Lamb Kebobs, which come over rice with a side salad. I ordered Lamb kebobs, NO rice, double salad. I received STEAK kebobs over rice and a double salad. I didn't say anything, or send it back, because it wasn't like it was bad. The steak was good (I really wanted lamb though!), and I didn't want them to throw it away. I ate the steak, left the rice...and the salad was awesome. It's cucumbers and peppers in a light vinegary sauce. I had two glasses of Cab with the meal and felt great afterwards. For someone to get my order so wrong when we were the only people in the place was kind of annoying. But he was friendly and amazing otherwise.

Some of my favorite dishes: Chicken Picatta (melt in your mouth combination of flavors)Spinach Gnocchi (their tomato sauce is to die for)Bottom line, the flavors that this restaurant was able to produce can rival any one star Michelin restaurant! Left a memorable impression on my palate and I can't wait to return for my 4th time there.PS. I actually quite like the fact that it's usually empty, not alot of traffic in.

I saw the lovely patio a lot driving or walking by, so I decided to purchase the Gropuon that was available a couple of weeks back. We went to brunch on a Sunday early afternoon, and when we arrived we were one of two tables in the place. This was a bit worrisome but more people did start to arrive over our stay. We sat on the patio which was very nice.The service was a bit strange and very slow for how empty the place was. I noticed a woman a couple of tables away only order a beer and it didn't come out for 15 minutes. It took a long time to receive water, order appetizers, and order our food. They never even gave us a drink menu, which they did give to everyone else (and I saw a lot of yummy looking sangria and bloody marys heading out to other tables). We ordered the cold spread sampler with the goat cheese pesto, urnebes, and hummus. If the meal had stopped there it would have been a much better experience. The hummus is actually one of the best I have had at Mediterranean style eateries. It has a lot more flavor than the traditional that seems to be only flavored with olive oil. The goat cheese pesto dip was also great, however I am wondering if it was made in-house. The urnebes is a cheese mixed with spices (it is orange in color) and definitely spicy but really yummy. Also could have definitely not been homemade but I'm not sure.Once again our appetizer as well as main dishes took a very long time (entrees over 45 minutes) to come out. Which was really strange to me considering, once again, there were hardly any other people in the place, and what we ordered cooks very quickly. I had the breakfast burrito off of the brunch menu, which is served with a pineapple relish and what were advertised as house potatoes. Generally speaking the burrito was OK, typical with eggs and guac. However the guac was clearly brown and had been sitting since at least the day before. The burrito also includes pork which was dry and chewy, and really had no flavor unless combined with the guac or cheese. The pineapple relish was OK alone but with the rest of the dish it just didn't fit. The house potatoes were extremely greasy and not even hot. In fact not much of my dish was hot, bringing me back to the point that it took 45 minutes to serve...Anyhow my boyfriend got the Balkan Sandwich which was just unfortunate and strange. I'm not familiar with Balkan cuisine so maybe it is just a cultural thing but the sandwich was cold and stuffed with TONS of raw mushrooms. He likes mushrooms, but it was weird that they were not cooked and there were just way too many. There was also just way too much ajvar on the sandwich. He really did not care for it. The sandwich comes with fries, which were very good but clearly not house-made and came from a freezer bag. I think they actually may have been the same fries that Aldi sells in the freezer. Not that I don't like these fries, I just think that making your own french fries is so easy like why not do it? So once again, just to emphasize that eggs and a cold sandwich took over 45 minutes to come out of the kitchen. I am not sure what they were doing back there but it certainly was not cooking.Overall I'm glad that we had the Groupon so it was a pretty cheap experience. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend and I doubt we will ever go back.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 7, 14]}, "41": {"description": "The Adriatic Cafe is one of the best and most underrated restaurants on Chicago's North Side, The restaurant has a new menu that includes dishes from Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece.

We were lucky and got seated right next to the little man-made pond/waterfall area. Soon we realized we actually weren't so lucky at all. Although this is a beautiful little area to look at, it's also apparently a kid magnet. It was not at all a good experience to have children yelling to their parents across the patio to come look at the fish. This literally happened about a dozen times while we were there. And I mean YELLING. Does anyone ever, you know, like, umm..., SUPERVISE THEIR CHILDREN?! So, beware, the beauty might not pay off if you still have your hearing. One more thing about this little area is that it's kind of a mess. Obviously someone maintains this little beauty, but they also leave all of their crap out when they're done. So it kind of looks like you're dining at your messy grandmother's backyard. Is it that hard to clean up after you're done?Alas, we mostly came here for the food, which was pretty good. The goat cheese pesto appetizer was plentiful, but nothing to rave about. It was just good. I can get the same cheese at Mariano's, so I wasn't too blown away. We also got the salmon benedict and the gypsy plate. The benedict was a little bit too smothered in sauce, which overpowered the dish. A slightly lighter taste would've been better. The gypsy plate was simple and delicious. The best part of both dishes was probably the potatoes.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 7, 21]}, "6": {"description": "Great service! Loved our food!

I've been visiting this store for over a year and a half and every single time I stop in the experience is no less than completely delightful. I'm from Cleveland, but I always make a point to stop in when I visit Chicago because the selection is just fantastic, not only in brands, but in range (few stores in my city carry more than one type of laceweight yarn). The store layout is open and airy and filled with natural light, and there are swatches of the yarns laid out below the displays. Sample projects are placed throughout the store-- including plenty of shawls in popular patterns kept on the chairs (spotted a Color Affection and a Hitchhiker on this visit) so you can pick them up and get a better idea of what your own project would look like. A lot of thought has been put into this store and it really shows. There's always a tablet in the middle of the store in a little seating area for looking up patterns-- such a great, functional detail. Prices are always clearly marked on the yarn and there's a great selection of instructional books and pattern collections. I've never had any trouble finding a specific yarn here-- it is always clean and organized. The store is pretty small, but the space is utilized so effectively that Windy Knitty manages to display a better selection than I've seen in yarn stores with twice the space.I can't finish this review without talking about Mandy, the owner. She is always incredibly helpful and gracious and her memory is remarkable! I doubt I get a chance to visit her store as much as most of her repeat customers, but even from the second visit she could recall that I was out of town and what yarn I've purchased or played with in the past. While I was browsing today, she stopped me to ask if I've seen new colors in a brand and weight that I purchased months and months ago-- I hadn't, so she took the time to pull the new colorways down from the shelf so I could take a look. She also didn't balk at winding the lace I'd picked up (I've been to many stores where employees groan at winding yarn), and explained it would just take a few minutes longer than usual since there was so much yardage. Regardless of the (awesome) selection, Mandy's amazing customer service will keep me shopping here whenever I'm in town.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 11, 24]}, "42": {"description": "This place has great yarn, and the owner is very nice and down-to-earth.

Last time I went I hadn't been in a while but she seemed to remember me and we had a nice chat while she rung me up. The space is open yet full of yarn. My only wish is that the shelves weren't so high - some yarns I can't get to easily. Still, this is my favorite yarn store in Chicago.

He told me just to rip it out and start over. Look guys, I want to support my LYS, but it IS cheaper just to purchase yarn online, so if I can't come in and ask a simple question as a paying customer, what's the point? Secondly, and most frustratingly, three times, my balls of yarn that have been wound here have ended up containing a rat's nest of yarn in the middle, to be painstakingly and maddeningly detangled later when I'm halfway through a project.

When I first moved to Chicago, I had such a nice interaction with the staff at the store, one of whom not only recommended an apartment in her building, and the other of whom walked me part way to my El station. Again, this is when I was new in Chicago!

Every time, I've walked out with something more than I went in for (always the sign of a good store). But what makes this a great store over a good yarn store is the people -- Mandy rocks. She knows her yarn, knows her customers and somehow knows exactly what to carry to make everyone happy. Her assistants are great and give you advice on what you're looking at, will tell you if the color you're trying out isn't quite for you, and they know their yarn materials and can make awesome suggestions for how to match something to a pre-selected pattern.

Modern and cool with a great display of their alcohol.. When we went there it was at 1:30 on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead, we had just missed rush supposedly. Let me break it down for you.Pros: Cute. Lesbian hot spot ( Chicago seems to lack lesbian hang outs) Very neat beer and liqueur collection. Friendly bartender. Cons: a little too far off the beaten path, move to Clark and Balmoral and we'll have a winner. The wine selection was pretty small..like..6 different wines which i think is pretty bleak for what most would consider a wine bar. Also.. the bartender said they weren't doing the burlesque shows anymore :( . As mentioned in another review. there were not any drink/deals/price listings that I saw so that's a downside.

Walked in, perused our options then proceeded to wait several minutes for the bartender to take her sweet time taking orders and making drinks for a group of 4 people. She never acknowledged us.  \u00a0 \u00a0I saw the two owners sitting down at the bar with about 6-8 bottles of wine which they were testing. I reached next to one of the owners to look at a cocktail menu when \u00a0she looked at me and grabbed her personal belongings as if she were afraid that I was going to steal them. First of all, why the hell are you using up real estate at your bar where I, the patron, could be siting? Second, why didn't you make us feel welcome by greeting us? I'm not looking to make your place my Cheers hangout, but for crying out loud, have the decency to train your staff and acknowledge your patrons. Finally, the group of four realized we were trying to order and they moved. Even the bartender looked at us and continued to walk away. We had to flag her down for an order. There were a total of 7 of us inside and 6 people outside. I was fuming and we both decided to stay for just 1 drink. I can't imagine how hard it is to get a drink at this place when they're busy?! \u00a0 We sat outside for our drinks which was nice.

I've been to Kopi several times over the past year (2013-2014) without updating my review. Until now. Each time I've visited Kopi, the quality of food and service have been hit-or-miss. I've been going to Kopi for 20 years, so I was willing to overlook a few mediocre experiences. After years and years of enjoying Kopi's food, service, and atmosphere, I have a history with this business. It's like an old friend. Sometimes that friend is a little moody, but you forgive her and continue with the friendship. There comes a time, though, when that friend abuses the relationship so much, you have to say good-bye forever. That time has come for me and Kopi.The atmosphere is still good. When I went in for breakfast recently, I noticed that some updating had been done, but it still held the same artsy vibe it always had. I sat down and was quickly given menus and waters for two, since I told the waiter I was waiting for a friend. When the friend arrived, she and the waiter exchanged a friendly hug and familiar greetings. Clearly, she'd been going to Kopi even more than I had, over the years.Despite that friendly greeting, once we ordered and received the food, the waiter disappeared. Not in a Halloween-type way, like vanished into a puff of smoke. No, he hung around the bar area, he chatted with another employee, he went into the back for some mysterious purpose. He never checked with us on our food, never refilled coffee or tea, just never did much waiter service at all. There were only three other tables occupied while we were there. It's not like he was so busy.Then there's the food. I ordered a tofu scramble with vegetables for $6.95. I got a tiny soup cup -- you know the kind, what you get when you order a cup of soup in a restaurant instead of a bowl? -- of entr\u00e9e, and a piece of French bread. That's it. That wasn't even appetizer size. I also ordered the vegetarian sausage. For $3.00, I got three over-cooked pieces of something, each of which was the size of a silver dollar. For $3.00. There were so hard, the tines of my fork actually bent trying to pick one up. I tried eating it just by putting it in my mouth. Burned. Dry. That was $10.00 worth of breakfast.My friend ordered a bagel and asked for extra cream cheese. She did get her bagel, and she did get the cream cheese. The waiter gave her two packets, charging her $.75 for each. She didn't know about the charge until we looked at the check.I was still hungry at the end of breakfast. I saw a treat in the counter, a peanut butter/chocolate muffin. That was $5.50. I scarfed it down on the walk to the car, because I was still so hungry. With tip, I ended up paying $20.00 for a poorly-cooked, tiny portion breakfast. $20.00!! \u00a0I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you, the tofu scramble and sausage were not enough to feed your 3-year-old. You get a small amount of mediocre food for high prices.No more second chances, Kopi. It took a year of bad experiences, but now, after this final visit, I'm done. From now on, it's M. Henry or Taste of Heaven. I get better more and better food, and better service, for less money.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 10, 22]}, "37": {"description": "I've eaten here a few times and every time I've been happy with the food and the welcoming atmosphere. The staff is friendly and efficient. I visited Kopi's gift shop with my husband, son and daughter-in-law yesterday (Monday) evening to find a last minute, unique gift for my mother. I asked if they had any hand mirrors. The woman behind the counter checked in a cabinet and found two lovely hand mirrors. She carried the two mirrors behind the counter with pretext of cleaning them. As I watched, I saw her remove a price sticker that showed $18, and attempt to surreptitiously replace it with a new price tag that had $24 on it. I didn't say anything, but I felt slightly insulted. I told her I wanted to look around a bit more, but that I would take the mirror. As I was looking at other items, I saw her approach the owner(?) and whisper something to him. It was odd, but I ignored it. I returned to the counter and paid for the mirror. I would have understood if she told me she had to mark up the price for any reason; however, changing a price tag in such a secretive manner, without saying anything to me, was offensive. You didn't get away with anything, sweetheart. Thing is, I would have happily paid the $24, even if you'd been open about it. I'll still visit for the food, and maybe even for the gift store.

I've been in Andersonville for about a year now, and finally had a vegetarian friend visit and thought this would be a great excuse to try. I've walked by thousands of times to see the people with delicious smelling food in the small outdoor seating on Clark, or see them relaxing at the low tables and pillows in the front window. So, I was very excited for my first Kopi experience. We went on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty open and we were able to sit at the low tables which was very nice, especially when relaxing and catching up with old friends.However, things started to get weird with our server almost immediately. He is doing this place a complete disservice. One of my friends asked about the \"natural soda\" and exactly what that meant (she is a huge Kombucha fan and was thinking maybe they fermented their own bevs here), he told her \"it just uses natural sugar, they just say that to make it sound better\". Now I've never worked in the service industry before, but I'm know you don't want to insult the restaurant's menu like that. Then there was a misunderstanding with the soup of the day. It turns out we were there the only day of the week that you can't order the soup of the day in a traditional (bowl or cup as a side) manner. This was very poorly explained and once a meal-sized portion of soup arrived to my friend, the waiter became defensive and wouldn't listen to our comments on how he didn't explain this to all of us. So our impression of the place was is now spiraling out of control. He argued with us for a couple of minutes before I asked to speak to a manager, who immediately said to charge us just for a bowl rather than the meal sized portion (about a $3 price difference - which is nothing to fuss over it was just the principle of good service at that point). So it's good that management at least knows how to deal with customers, as we were ready to walk out at this point. We are three indecisive ladies, and it did take us a while to make a final choice for our main orders. One of my friends asked the waiter a couple of questions about the dishes, like what how the tempeh burger is seasoned, to which he replied \"I don't know, definitely soy sauce, some other spices. We don't make anything in house\". He repeated this same type of answer for all of our other questions about ingredients or seasoning. The entire interaction was just bizarre and he ended up coming off as rude and that he didn't care about the food at all. Which is fine I guess he doesn't have to care, but if you want to give a good impression and not to mention upsell customers, you better be able to describe what is put into the food and what makes it delicious.We ended up getting the black bean burger, the tempeh burger, and the libido burrito (all highly recommended on Yelp). The food was really good, and despite our server repeatedly telling us that nothing was made in house (still not sure where exactly it is made), it tasted like it was. My burrito had a ton of seasoning and the soup (mentioned earlier) was especially delicious. Unfortunately I don't remember the name. All in all, it was a bit of an off-putting experience no thanks to our server.

I had the Oregan Chai which was spiced nicely with Cinnamon and others. My friend had the Peppermint Latte which tasted like a melted down Peppermint Patty! It wasn't too sweet, but it had a more authentic mint taste than other lattes. The menu offers all day breakfast, soups, sandwiches, appetizers, and salads. Kopi offers a many deserts and pastries. I had the Challa French toast. Absolutely delightful! I asked the waitress to leave the maple syrup and the triple berry capote on the side so I could taste the bread on its own. My friend ordered the fluffy eggs with salmon and dill sour cream on multi grain bread. The sour cream pulled the dish together when spread on the bread and eaten with the eggs. A unique thing about Kopi is that there is one waitress that brings drinks and food to customers at tables. One does not go up and pick their food up from the counter like other cafes. The waitress also brings water and buses the table. Yet there is no expectation to tip him or her.

I've been to Kopi several times over the past year (2013-2014) without updating my review. Until now. Each time I've visited Kopi, the quality of food and service have been hit-or-miss. I've been going to Kopi for 20 years, so I was willing to overlook a few mediocre experiences. After years and years of enjoying Kopi's food, service, and atmosphere, I have a history with this business. It's like an old friend. Sometimes that friend is a little moody, but you forgive her and continue with the friendship. There comes a time, though, when that friend abuses the relationship so much, you have to say good-bye forever. That time has come for me and Kopi.The atmosphere is still good. When I went in for breakfast recently, I noticed that some updating had been done, but it still held the same artsy vibe it always had. I sat down and was quickly given menus and waters for two, since I told the waiter I was waiting for a friend. When the friend arrived, she and the waiter exchanged a friendly hug and familiar greetings. Clearly, she'd been going to Kopi even more than I had, over the years.Despite that friendly greeting, once we ordered and received the food, the waiter disappeared. Not in a Halloween-type way, like vanished into a puff of smoke. No, he hung around the bar area, he chatted with another employee, he went into the back for some mysterious purpose. He never checked with us on our food, never refilled coffee or tea, just never did much waiter service at all. There were only three other tables occupied while we were there. It's not like he was so busy.Then there's the food. I ordered a tofu scramble with vegetables for $6.95. I got a tiny soup cup -- you know the kind, what you get when you order a cup of soup in a restaurant instead of a bowl? -- of entr\u00e9e, and a piece of French bread. That's it. That wasn't even appetizer size. I also ordered the vegetarian sausage. For $3.00, I got three over-cooked pieces of something, each of which was the size of a silver dollar. For $3.00. There were so hard, the tines of my fork actually bent trying to pick one up. I tried eating it just by putting it in my mouth. Burned. Dry. That was $10.00 worth of breakfast.My friend ordered a bagel and asked for extra cream cheese. She did get her bagel, and she did get the cream cheese. The waiter gave her two packets, charging her $.75 for each. She didn't know about the charge until we looked at the check.I was still hungry at the end of breakfast. I saw a treat in the counter, a peanut butter/chocolate muffin. That was $5.50. I scarfed it down on the walk to the car, because I was still so hungry. With tip, I ended up paying $20.00 for a poorly-cooked, tiny portion breakfast. $20.00!! \u00a0I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you, the tofu scramble and sausage were not enough to feed your 3-year-old. You get a small amount of mediocre food for high prices.No more second chances, Kopi. It took a year of bad experiences, but now, after this final visit, I'm done. From now on, it's M.

The terrible experience I had a while back changed all of that. I suffer from psoriasis and have been going to the doctor for years to treat it. It is a non contagious autoimmune disease and can be socially crippling and stressful. I finally found a place that treated me normally and would not make me feel uncomfortable to get a pedicure and I was so grateful for that. One day I went in and was not able to get my usual angel of a tech, rose, and settled for someone new. Immediately upon sitting down the tech pointed at my legs and yelled for the owner, sue, to come over. Keep in mind that I had been coming regularly once a week for two years and knew sue by name. She somehow got amnesia and was suddenly concerned for my safety and refused to allow the tech to exfoliate my legs. I was used to these types of conversations and calmly explained, again, that it was not contagious, good for me, and my doctor would approve a scrub. I also asked her why it was suddenly a problem, now, with a full salon of patrons watching, because it had never been an issue before. She began rolling her eyes at me at I became so uncomfortable and emotional I began to cry. The people in the chairs were staring and I was devastated because I came to this place as a sort of safety place where I could enjoy the services judgement free. Sue continued badgering me and I left with wet feet and shoes in hand in tears. I don't blame her for my emotions because they run deep with this issue, but I do blame her for terrible customer service skills. She did not have the compassion or intelligence to listen to what I was telling her or consider that I was a customer who paid for services once a week. I have never gone back since and still have negative thoughts even looking at the store front. the technicians there are all sweet and deal with the terrible treatment from the owner and I feel for them so this is in no way a review of services.

Order is accepted and I'm told it will be an hour. Then I get an order confirmation and it notes the pick-up time for 5pm...THE NEXT DAY. Their system took my order despite the restaurant being closed. I call the next morning, explain the error & ask that the order be cancelled. I'm assured this will be handled. Fast forward to 4:55pm, Giordano's calls to let me know that my order is \"ready to rock & roll.\" I explain that I cancelled the order and why I had to do so, they employee assures me that the charge will be cancelled and they'll take care of everything. I put this out of mind, assuming it's taken care of. A couple weeks later, I notice the charge on my credit card bill. They did NOT cancel it. I call to ask for a refund and the manager says they can give me store credit (ugh, no thanks) or call corporate to get a form, then call me to fill it out, then send it to corporate, then I'll get my refund. This is entirely ridiculous, so I just processed a dispute with my credit card to avoid this runaround. Also, between the initial order and finding the charge on my card, I placed another order - online, again. After placing the order, I realized I never got an email confirmation. Call the restaurant and they assume my name is something other than what it is and disappear to investigate. After telling me there is no order under that name, I tell them they had it wrong and what my real name is...which they still don't hear correctly. After 3 minutes of just trying to give them my freaking name, they finally figure it out and see that there is indeed no record of the order which I placed. \u00a0Apparently the \"easiest way to order\" is not online because they screw it up every time. Also, the pizza is not that great. Lou Malnati's delivers to Andersonville now and that's better pizza. Also, Ranalli's is cheaper and also better.
