I tip (high) when I get food delivered, or when the wait staff serves me at a table, but I don't \u00a0tip when I drive to a place and have them hand me food I bought. \u00a0I don't tip the cashier at Dominick's or the lady at the gas station register, either. I always want to slip a piece of paper into the tip jar that says, \"Here's a tip! Don't stand up in a canoe!\"Jiang's has a tip jar, a hand-decorated paper cup that manages to be both kind of a scold and pathetic. I think there's a big cultural misunderstanding regarding tip jars--they seem to have proliferated at non-American-owned businesses. Here's what the counterman doesn't understand: tips are for services rendered beyond the price of the product. Also, a lot of restaurants pay their wait staff less than minimum wage because they are facotring in tips. A regular hourly salary and no extra service=no tip necessary.So yeah, I got that off my chest....but the food IS good, it is better than Chi Tung's (which used to be THE place to go for Asian but then got really big and really snooty and really blah).

The owner of the cafe is an utlra friendly, personable, charming and welcoming young woman. I like that she takes time out to come from behind the counter and greet and answer any questions customers (like myself) might have. The cafe is not a large place, but is big on the things that count for me...inexpensive, yet tasty food, excellent service, vibe, talent, atmosphere and good times. They boast a good selection of menu choices along with healthier ones too. Their serving sizes come in large portions, and because me and my friends all had purchased our own $20 worth of food for $10 deals, we certainly got an enormous bang for our buck! I am glad that Ellie's also caters to the taste of the vegan/vegetarian community (Yay). I ordered the delicious veggie burger along with another vegetarian dish ( I forget the name) which arrived hot and ready to gobble ...and greedy me, devoured every yummy yum yum morsel. \u00a0OMG...the Ginger Ale is to live for...best I've ever tasted. This beverage is served up icey cold and has all natural ingredients of real ginger and cane sugar. While I don't do many sweet drinks or juices, \u00a0I promise you, this is one non-alcoholic libation I could easily get hooked on (smile). I'll take mine on the rocks please : ) Oh, before I forget...they don't serve alcohol, but you can also BYOB (nice right?). The night I was there, there was only one waitress... (Wendy I believe is her name) and she was quite on her square. She was patient, polite and gave good food suggestions to my party of 5. I enjoyed the \"Poetry in Motion\" which I am told is every 3rd week Saturday of month for a donation of $5. \u00a0Initially, the night of poetry started with a rather small crowd and was a bit behind the eight ball in terms of time. However, before nights end, the house was filled to the brim and invigorated with the sweet, illustrious sounds of rich, spoken word. Well worth the $5 donation. I especially enjoyed the poets, Mr. Lucky and Ben. A sure shot of word play for your senses. My talented friend, Leslie J. even got up and blessed the audience with her flavored brand of poetry. Leslie J got plenty of big ol head nods and exciting applause from everyone there. Way to go Leslie J...you Rock Talented Poetress!. So glad I got to experience all the talented, creative poets and newcomers who stopped through and \u00a0'Flow-essed' us with their skills. I like that the poet & MC host, Mr. Lucky, has the audience shake their keys instead of the traditional snapping of the fingers (way cool). As well, Mr. Lucky laid down the house rules and kept everyone genuinely engaged. All night long I was shaking my keys and licking my chops :) I would like to also shake my keys at the other half of the talented 'Lucky' team... Mrs. Lucky who rocked the crowd to \u00a0some very nice music from various genres' and throwbacks . For the finale', a talented female comedian had the entire audience rolling and doubled over in stitches. Her dialogue was a bit on the raunchy side, but as she would say \"don't judge her...cause she don't give a ----\" ...well, I am sure you know the rest (ha ha). What a fab time my friends and I had a. I definitely plan to go again.*Side Note about Yelp. Unfortunately, one star for Yelp, because after purchasing online voucher for this cafe, it never arrived in my email box. I wrote Yelp about the matter, but have never heard back from them. Due to my phone, I couldn't choose the option of downloading Yelp's app directly to my phone so that my purchase could simply be scanned by establishment. Therefore, I had to spend a lot of time on computer, before traveling to the cafe, on the computer, looking around the Yelp site along with internet to find out how to remedy the \u00a0problem so that I would have a print out for proof of my Ellie's Cafe purchase.Very Frustrating. To make a long story shorter...I explained to the owner (whom I had never met) my dilemma, and she told me that I could call her the next day with the redemption code for the voucher. Now that's what I call real people service. How wonderful that there are those in the world, who are welcoming in their spirit and trust others with their word.

It came with three small sides of cheese, sour cream, and green onion so that you could make it your own which I thought was pretty neat.In conclusion, Ellie's has stolen my heart and I'm sure it will steal yours too.

I immediately melted into the table as she worked from light to medium to deep pressure, while alternating between the three depending on what my muscles needed. \u00a0I have had many, many massages over the last 9 years of being a therapist myself and I have to say, she is by far one of the best MT's I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and being worked on by. \u00a0Being in this industry, I expect the best therapy possible and have been disappointed more times than I would like to admit. \u00a0Shan's work is exceptional, I promise you will not be disappointed. \u00a0Besides having excellent bed side manner, Shan is compassionate about her work. \u00a0You can tell that she truly loves helping people and wants to relieve your aches and pains. \u00a0She's sympathetic and understands from a professional standpoint what my body was going through and what I specifically needed in order to unwind and relax. \u00a0For the first time in a long time, I actually slept through the night, not tossing and turning like I normally do from neck pain. \u00a0She worked out the knots I had in my upper neck and shoulder region while releasing tension in my low back. \u00a0Due to this, I haven't had a headache since my massage with her, which is unusual because it's been my norm since becoming a therapist.

She had to deal with a few drunks and was doing a good job controlling it.Second - pizza was amazing! Boom! Wow! It was super hot when it came out, but it cooled down and it was great! Beer was refreshing too although it is quite pricey!Third the service was good. Nora and the hostess did a good job!

They take forever to deliver your food, and if you live anywhere but Morgan Park, Beverly, or Evergreen, good luck getting them to deliver.3. Service - SUCKS! The people that work there are friendly, but seem very confused. Orders aren't right, and they communicate poorly to the customers. They also haven't developed a good system for Carry-Out orders.4. Lunch Menu - First let me say this place is always empty at lunch (not a good sign). \u00a0But the lunch specials are too expensive, and anything but the pizza (i.e. burgers) is better tasting and cheaper somewhere else.5. Pizza - I won't come right out and say it \"SUCKS\" but it's not as good as the original. \u00a0I don't know what they could be doing different, but the pizza doesn't taste as fresh.So in summary, if you're reading this review in the need of some GREAT pizza, you're better off going to Lou Malnati's, Vito & Nicks, or Palermos pizza instead. \u00a0All are very close to the area, and 10x better than this establishment.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 12, 5]}, "43": {"description": "Not bad. \u00a0Surly manager, decent service.

For a number of years she has ordered ribs from Best for her district's annual potluck. She swore by Best's, claiming them to be some of the best ribs she has ever had. \u00a0Unfortunately, that has come to an end as she has decided never to shop here again. \u00a0This year, she ordered over $100 in ribs as she always does. \u00a0When she picked them up, the ribs were not in a aluminum pan as they had always been but in styrofoam containers as if it was a regular take out order, and not a huge order of over $100. Who orders that much in individual containers? She thought it was unusual but chalked it up to them maybe being out of large aluminum pans given their popularity. When she got the order home, and began to transfer the ribs into an aluminum pan of her own, she was very disappointed to discover that the styrofoam containers contained fries and bread, as if these were individual orders. \u00a0Also, the ribs which she said were always very meaty and soft, were instead dry and very fatty with little meat. \u00a0As I said, she has done this for some years and always ordered just ribs. She never ordered the fries and bread, and they soaked up all of the sauce in the containers, which is the main reason for patronizing Best's. There was not enough sauce left for the ribs when she finished transferring the ribs into the aluminum container and called Best's to let them know what happened. \u00a0She spoke to a person named Derrick, who, along with bad customer service phone skills, attempted to tell her that that is how that put their orders together when that has NEVER happened in all the years she has ordered food from Best's. She informed him that she has been a loyal customer for years and never received an order like that and was then told that Best's is under new management. \u00a0She informed Derrick that she would be sending a person to pick up a pint of sauce for the ribs and that it was a huge inconvenience to put her through. She received no apology. I was the person asked to pick up the sauce. \u00a0Even though there was no one receiving food, I had to wait four minutes to get the sauce after paying an extra $4.33 for it. \u00a0I saw a woman in the back prepare the container, then walk it not up the counter but behind a wall where it sat for three minutes. \u00a0She then put it in a paper bag and gave it to me with no apology or smile. I smiled, but she didn't. \u00a0I don't trust them. I think that they spit or put something else in the sauce. \u00a0There is no reason why she needed to take the sauce to the back instead of just bringing it to the front where I was standing. \u00a0I no longer will recommend this place either and I caution anyone else who has an issue with them. Their customer service has never been that great but the lack of it was always overlooked because of the quality of the meat and of course, their great sauce. no longer. \u00a0With them supposedly being under new management and hearing about how the quality of the ribs has declined, I would not be surprised if their revenue falls considerably this year.

Where Gen Xers like me will say reminded them of their best glory days, too, whether it be our own memories about the places, like when we first started buying music in the 1980s or early 1990s, or stories we heard about these kinds of places through the boomers...And at its best moments, it can still bring that idea to mind, even today. But the problem is, like other places that fall in to this category--for instance, Val Halla's out in Oak Park--the present day versions ARE NOT what they were in the 1980s or 1990s. The place has become a vinyl graveyard. Records that are warped and unplayable sold as G, records that are good sold as VG, and that feeling that things should be different than what it we are getting...What is Beverly Records today as a result? Mostly, a store selling LPs of poor or, at best, good quality as VG because they need to keep the doors open somehow. And piles of CDs nobody really wants.

I found out that Beverly Records has a guy that has tons of experience with turntables. I drove the hour drive to get there and dropped off the TT. The guy that, I believe, owns the store seemed calm, quiet and nice enough. He placed my well boxed TT on a desk or something, it's hard to tell what it was due to all the massive clutter which I have come to expect from old school record shops. I had to have a look around at the huge selection. Tons and tons of tired old and not so old records with the priced marked with a Sharpie on the back cover. I hear they keep the \"good\" stuff \u00a0in the back. I was surprised to see a huge metal fan stacked on top of what looked to be junk records in a bin. Whether they were junk or not is beside the point, there's a big honker fan on top of a full record bin! I left soon after and was told the repair guy would call me. I received a call from an older sounding guy who told me what he did and that he did not see a second cartridge that I taped on one of the Styrofoam planks in the box. I wanted him to see if it was good or not but, he never found one, someone lost it. No big deal, it came free with the TT. He also told me that the dust cover acrylic had a crack on it. I told him it came that way so, no problem. The crack I am speaking of is a chip off a corner of the dust cover so small it was not an issue. When I picked up the TT today I found out that he really mean that the dust cover was cracked in half and missing screws for the wood side panels to hold it together. Somewhere along the line someone handled the TT poorly but, no one was admitting to doing it!!! I was very upset! I had barley played more that 2 songs on this TT, it's very rare, the dustcover may have been customized and now in looks like junk. His quote was, \"It must have been dropped somewhere along the line\". I was amazed at the shop owners lack of responsibility however, I was so upset over this he decided to give me not only a refund on the repair but, he bought the TT back for exactly what I paid. That's why I gave 2 stars. I will not return to this messy careless store again! Also, they sell a T-Shirt that says \"Drum Machines Have No Soul\". I happen to be not only a huge fan of rootsy, acoustic Americana and dozens of other genres but, I;m also a \u00a0huge fan of all types of electronic music. Sure, the old, old school drum machines don't have a soul but, latter technology has improved greatly since those days. Electronic music can and does have lots of soul when it chooses to.

I was president of \"The Clean Plate Club\" since was called \"brain food\".Growing up I kept coming to DiCola's despite the lack of ways the fish was prepared. Always breaded, always deep fried. My trips became less frequent unless I had a jones for jumbo shrimp & occasionally lobster.During one trip heard someone order their fish grilled. Grilled? I didn't even know they did that. Why didn't anyone mention that before? Partly because the people employed here are kind of lousy & disinterested in what they're doing. Their goal seems to move you in and out like an assembly line. Which would be OK if the food were better. But it's not.The trick about grilled is you have to get it before the chef leaves, which is around 6 p.m., just when people are getting home from work. \u00a0Only the historic lack of food choices along Far South Western I continued to make this a destination.", "rating": "2", "date": [2008, 10, 16]}, "2": {"description": "Good food.

Shopping here is almost like shopping in another dimension for me. Shelved items are organized in weird ways and it's kind of hard to figure out where things are, but while I'm looking I always find new and amazing items I would have never known to look for. Their variety is impressive. My latest adventures turned up chocolate fig ice cream, gummy candies shaped like fried eggs, a beautiful cheddar cheese with brandy in it and BLT dip made there - and that dip was good, seriously, if you see that dip out, get the largest size available, which will cost about $4 (I am seriously buying some more today). Although you can find really incredibly good, even cheap, deals, you have to be careful about their pricing, because some stunners lurk. I saw a gallon of organic milk in there yesterday for $7.49 (I'm looking for a way right now to make numbers caps...). It was horrifying. That's at least a good dollar more than most Whole Foods - actually I bought the exact same gallon at Whole Foods for $5.99 a couple of days ago. Of course, County Fair's regular milk price was $2.99, which is a good deal. Again, be sure you know what the price is before you get it into the cart. One weird/gross thing - the dog food is shelved in the middle of processed people food, like across from the spaghetti sauce and on the shelf side-by-side with canned soups. My take on that was that I was being warned against the dangers of processed food \"Do not put that shit in your cart Tina! That shit is like DOG FOOD!!\" Perhaps I should heed this as the public service it is.... The produce section is lovely, again with lots of variety and prices that sometimes come really close to Stanley's.

Admittedly I am aware of this, but I enjoy painting a picture of my experiences instead of just saying \"the food was good, the servers were nice and the decor was great.\" \u00a0I want you to feel like you are there with me, so that's how I write.

Lumes was not around when I was a kid, but the taste, the look, and the spirit of these place is very much how I remember the restaurants of old. The waitresses in their diner-like uniforms, the bus boys busy clearing tables almost immediately after you stand to leave... and the warm greetings you receive from staff welcoming you to dine. Lumes is classic Chicago.THE FOODI can't remember the last time I had a breakfast that included a GIANT five egg omelette loaded with sausage, onions, peppers and cheese on a plate the size of Alaska for under $10. If that weren't enough, included in the price was a troth of hash browned potatoes and two warm and fluffy \u00a0buttermilk pancakes server with delicious syrup and room temperature whipped butter. What I love even more is that I come from a family that does not allow visitors to pay for food. My Uncle practically broke my arm when I reached for the check. Even though I didn't pay, I can say for certain you get your monies worth here.THE VERDICTWithout a lot of overly descriptive adjectives, let me just simply say we enjoyed EVERYTHING about this place.

I've been told I practically need to include a table of contents. Admittedly I am aware of this, but I enjoy painting a picture of my experiences instead of just saying \"the food was good, the servers were nice and the decor was great.\" \u00a0I want you to feel like you are there with me, so that's how I write. However, most of my Chicagoland area reviews will likely be much shorter, because Chicago holds a special place in my memory banks. \u00a0Everything about this city calls out to my native soul. So it's hard to describe the experience of returning home in words that would make sense to anyone but me. THE SCENEI love this city and every bite of a good meal floods me with decades of memories. I can still remember walking into places like Lumes as a toddler with my grandmother and eating breakfast in my booster seat. Lumes was not around when I was a kid, but the taste, the look, and the spirit of these place is very much how I remember the restaurants of old. The waitresses in their diner-like uniforms, the bus boys busy clearing tables almost immediately after you stand to leave... and the warm greetings you receive from staff welcoming you to dine. Lumes is classic Chicago.THE FOODI can't remember the last time I had a breakfast that included a GIANT five egg omelette loaded with sausage, onions, peppers and cheese on a plate the size of Alaska for under $10. If that weren't enough, included in the price was a troth of hash browned potatoes and two warm and fluffy \u00a0buttermilk pancakes server with delicious syrup and room temperature whipped butter. What I love even more is that I come from a family that does not allow visitors to pay for food. My Uncle practically broke my arm when I reached for the check. Even though I didn't pay, I can say for certain you get your monies worth here.THE VERDICTWithout a lot of overly descriptive adjectives, let me just simply say we enjoyed EVERYTHING about this place. The food, the service, the old school decor and especially the fact that they call sodas \"pop\" here in the Midwest! \u00a0I miss that so much and got the biggest thrill when my waitress asked if I wanted water, juice or POP!!!! \u00a0They serve you more food that you could reasonably eat for barely anything in terms of cost, so yeah... don't hurt yourself trying to finish your plate.Yelp100[56]", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 4, 8]}, "54": {"description": "Lumes....mmmhhhh....Came here for the first time about two months ago.

For example, I was just there two days ago and has been the case for the twenty years or so I have patronized the place, there was one Black waitress. I have never seen a male waiter. I have never seen a Black cook. And, perhaps most curious is there has never been a Black host or hostess. The hosts, incidentally, seat patrons and run the register.

When she brought my order of pancakes, they were cold; the butter wouldn't melt on them, so I asked that they be heated. Then, while I ate my scrambled egg whites, I bit into something foreign; it happened to be an onion that was apparently on the grill. I beckoned for Tiffany, showed her the onion, and asked if something could be done about this gross oversight. By now I was turned off because I was eating in stages, waiting on this or that. When my bill came I noticed that there was no adjustment to it, so I asked Tiffany (again) if something could be done.The manager walked over, and in an irritated and elevated voice, proceeded to tell me (twice), that Tiffany asked if I wanted my eggs replaced, and that I said, \"No\". I agreed that I had indicated that I did not want more eggs, because as I stated, I was no longer interested in more eggs; the onion turned me off and I stopped eating altogether. The manager then says to me, \"Well, I'm only going to take $2 off your bill because Tiffany asked if you wanted more eggs, and you said no!\"I couldn't believe that response. I come to Lumes often, I am a 20% plus tipper, and I do not \"Find\" opportunities to get items taken off my bill. I chewed an onion that was NOT part of my meal (in fact, I hate onions), and the manager didn't have the wisdom, nor professionalism, to understand that I could have made a big stink about it; many would have. To add insult to injury, she only took $2 off my bill, even though I was charged an additional $1 for the egg whites. Really??? There was a better way to handle my situation!

The best they could come up with has been a bloated, mumbling caricature of The King, an embarrassment to Presley's legacy as a performer.Look around. Every town has its \"Elvis impersonator,\" some middle-aged white guy with sideburns the size of sirloins and a one-dimensional persona: bad. And they all seem to be channeling the same Elvis era - the early-'70s kitsch when the fame had caught up with him, and he wasn't in the best shape of his life.Those impersonators have drained the excitement out of Elvis' performances, leaving little more than a tacky sideshow for audiences to snicker at.And that's exactly why tribute artists such as \"Elvis Spectacular\" creator Mark Hussman deserve a look.Chicago's favorite Elvis doesn't actually \"do\" Elvis. That's left up to the amateur impersonators. Hussman doesn't even sound entirely like The King, but he's got a heck of a capable voice and a range that allows him to segue smoothly from the tuneful \"Blue Spanish Eyes\" to yearning \"The Impossible Dream.\" He doesn't even entirely resemble Elvis, except for the full - and natural - hairdo. He is who he is: Mark Hussman. And the guy excites in the passion of performing.That was evident with the sold-out crowd at the Beverly Arts Center Jan. 13 who packed the theater to see what is likely to become a tradition of sorts the weekend after Presley's Jan. 8 birthday.Hussman was backed by the 10-piece ExSpence Account Showband, the Elvis tribute band selected by Elvis Presley Enterprises/Graceland to perform at the official 30th Anniversary Elvis show in Memphis. Clad in pink and black, the EAS sounded superb - not uncommon for musical acts at the Beverly Arts Center, one of the classiest performance venues in the area.And the crowd: It's quite a feat to sell out to an audience rowdy enough to stick around after a two-hour first set, even for those who have chosen to carry Presley's legacy - and I've seen performers of all sorts: that nutty band of broads known simply as the Wayniacs who religiously follow Mr. Las Vegas across the country from one gig to the next, Neil Diamond's rabid faithful and the feral females who toss their unmentionables Welsh stud Tom Jones.But Elvis? I know, I know. He was the first performer ever to sell out Madison Square Garden, and he had more gold albums than the Beatles. Still, the guy's been dead for 30 years, yet his tribute shows still pack the house. And his own fans - in this case ranging from toddlers to hip-shakin' seniors (irony-obsessed twenty-somethings were thankfully absent) - go nuts for guys like Hussman, who's found his own orbit in the Elvis universe.He treated the audience to a first (he had never before performed \"Walk a Mile in My Shoes\") as well as a host of stuffed teddy bears (during, well, you guessed it) and leis (for his Hawaiian set that included \"Blue Hawaii\" and \"Rock-a-Hula Baby\"). Yet he didn't hog the spotlight, giving a mention to pretty much everyone involved with the show, plus friends and Presley contemporaries from Ann-Margret to Brigitte Bardot.Hussman mines deep into the Presley songbook, from rock 'n roll to country to hymns and ballads. His are arena-style interpretations that sounded quite at home at the 420-seat Beverly Arts Center. The gig was typical of a Hussman bonanza, which combines Presley's famed '70s-style concert format with The King's film performances - spectacles in themselves.After nearly two hours without a break, Hussman and the band performed an inspired \"An American Trilogy\" followed by the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" during which his Margrocks dancers - a Vegas-style troupe reminiscent of Elvis' dancers during his movie musicals of the 1960s - distributed American flags to the more than 400 audience members against the backdrop of a stage bathed in red. The crowd rose to its feet and joined him, waving flags and singing solemnly, turning the BAC into Las Vegas Hilton, circa 1972.But don't be mistaken. This is the Elvis of the 21st century: With references to MySpace peppering his dialogue with the audience, the early-'70s vibe ends where the naval piercings begin (seriously - one of Hussman's backup dancers shimmied with a sparkling belly chain). Hussman is less concerned with creating a facsimile of The King's snarl and karate chops than he is with bringing his passion to his audiences.During a fabulously soulful \"In the Ghetto,\" Hussman wisely kept the stage to himself during what was one of Elvis' most socially conscious tunes. Later, Hussman and the band broke into a gorgeous rendition of \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" The number left no doubt about a band that really is in its prime and a vocalist who, after a marathon three-hour set, still has it.", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 11, 17]}, "4": {"description": "The Beverly Arts Center is fantastic. \u00a0Wonderful place for kid's activities and plays.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 11, 2]}, "24": {"description": "I've been familiar with this place since it was located just a half block down in a smaller building. \u00a0One of the chief instructors, Mary Lee, was supposedly very hard-nosed but still kind at her core. \u00a0I happened to get hit by a car in front of the center one day several years ago, and she rushed into the building (after hours) to get paper towel for all of the blood coming out of my nose and mouth. \u00a0I also knew her as my sisters' ballet instructor; her efforts weren't entirely successful, but she started a lifelong interest in dance for at least one of them. \u00a0You can go here for tap, modern, jazz and ballet lessons, btw.", "rating": "5", "date": [2005, 7, 26]}, "6": {"description": "This place is still awesome.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 7, 27]}, "15": {"description": "We love this place.

The BAC is a gorgeous building on 111th in the Beverly/Morgan Park neighborhood. I think these are the last Chicago neighborhoods you can venture into before leaving the city (to Oak Lawn?). Check out the Southwest side. There's much to see and do.To begin with, not only is there ample street parking (no evil meters; I hope I didn't just jinx this) but the BAC has parking facilities. The layout is homey and urbane at the same time. Concrete flooring adds to the loft feel but the grassy courtyard area reminds you that the lushness of nature is never far away. There's art on every wall throughout the two stories and one of my favorite areas is the first floor corridor of windows and small tables -- perfect for an afternoon spent with your laptop, a coffee and some springtime wanderlust. If nature isn't your thing, kick back with a $3 movie in the BAC's ginormous movieplex. Advertised to be playing while I was there: \"An Education,\" that Helen Mirren movie that was just up for an Oscar and several other arty flicks that my \"Dumb and Dumber\" sensibilities didn't quite register (but I know they were good). Even better than a $3 movie? A $3 beer to drink while you watch the movie. Yep. Beer. For $3. While you watch a movie. Awesome.There are active past times to indulge in, as well. BAC offers a variety of art classes, photography, pilates, etc. If you need a place to drop the kids or a place to refuel from your day, it's likely the BAC has something that would interest you. I love the fact that, at its heart, the BAC is a community center that caters to the community's needs. One thing I didn't notice while I was there was some sort of cafe. I'm betting that once the BAC adds that (even though there are plenty of dining options across the street in a few directions), it's going to be tough to get people to _leave_ the BAC.

Seriously picture perfect, exactly what I wanted, couldn't have been better. Maybe one of my favorite parts of my wedding.However, my bouquet was all wrong. When we had our first meeting with The Blossom Boys, I brought in 6 pictures of bouquets I liked. 5 of the 6 were of tight, mounded style bouquets, and 1 was a looser garden-style. I explained, I wanted the mounded style, but I included the other picture because I liked it's colors. I said specifically I don't like bouquets with alot of green leafy filler in them. When we went back for our second meeting to hear their proposal, they had me down for a loose garden-style bouquet. I corrected them, and watched him make the change on the paper. Months later, when we made our final payment, I checked AGAIN that they had me down for a mounded-style bouquet; and they did. However, when the flowers showed up on the wedding day; my bouquet was in a loose garden style with all sorts of extra green buds shooting out of it. My dad and one of my bridesmaids spent a few minutes snipping all the green things off, and it helped ALOT but I still didn't really care for the overall look of it.Additionally, the shop could be very difficult to get a hold of at times. They also made a mistake and tried to double charge us the delivery fee. Also, our wedding was two weeks ago, we made the final payment two weeks before that, but TODAY they replied to a month old email asking when we could come by to drop off our last check. So many levels of not organized....Bottom Line: These guys will do amazing work for you, but you need to be prepared to stay on top of them and be CRYSTAL CLEAR with what you want from DAY ONE.

\u00a0I bite the bullet and get a bucket of Budweiser for $12. \u00a0It's not bad while cold but then quickly gets warm from the heat of the crowd. \u00a0I chase it down with nips off of the flask of Crown my buddy brought. \u00a0My first impression of McNally's is that it reminds me of some of the older blue-collar places on the east side of Madison or more accurately Milwaukee. \u00a0Nothing stands out as original or that unique, but I've also come on the one day a year that the place is out of character. \u00a0As the parade goes past I try to station myself near the door so that I can at least see a bit of it, since I don't get many kilt-wearing firemen up my way. \u00a0We all occasionally duck out for a smoke and everyone but me risks the wrath of the CPD and piss in the alley. \u00a0I figure the cops can suss out a Sconnie like me no problem, so I wait in the interminable line for the restrooms. \u00a0Plus my red UW hoodie would be a dead giveaway. \u00a0I've been constantly dealing with the crush of the crowd and spilled beer on countless people by this point, so it feels great to go into the piss-stained alley for a smoke and the ability to extend my elbows straight out from my body.As the afternoon wears on I manage to remain at least coherently sober and keep most of the group together. \u00a0I seem to be the only one. \u00a0I'm wearing the only green seasonally-appropriate article of clothing I own, which happens to be a Maccabi Haifa stocking cap I had recently bought in Israel. \u00a0I strike up a conversation with someone that recognizes the Hebrew on the cap, but then shit goes south when one of my friends becomes suspicious and goes off on a vaguely anti-Semitic diatribe, something about Lithuanians and I have no idea what else. \u00a0The ethnic identification in Chicago confuses me because there are no real ethnic neighborhoods where I'm from, and besides Madison is a yuppie/hippie/college dynamic surrounded by white-bread suburbs and farms. \u00a0Besides, isn't everyone supposed to be Irish today? \u00a0I'm in way over my head here.A man who I was later told was an owner comes up to me and proceeds to insult both my Badgers and my Cubs for some time. \u00a0We kind of get into it. \u00a0I can understand that he correctly identified me as a Badger given my UW hoodie but how did he know I was a Cubs fan? \u00a0Would only a Cubbie be audacious enough to wear a green Israeli soccer cap to an Irish parade? \u00a0I learn later that my Sox fan friend tipped him off and asked him to take me down a peg. \u00a0I didn't know I was even up a peg. \u00a0Whatever - at this point I equate the South Side with Milwaukee, a place I've got to keep my head down or attract the wrath of the locals. \u00a0That's fine, because I'm able to take a bit of shit from the proles from time to time so long as i can get back to my base of arrogant self-righteousness in Madison. \u00a0The crowd started to thin out and we decided to call it a day. \u00a0Half of the group managed to get themselves locked out earlier, and when I leave I expect to get into another jawing match with the owner at the door. \u00a0Instead he's as nice as possible and my seething rage completely vanishes. \u00a0This is where I learn that you've apparently got to earn respect from these guys, and somehow I've done that.Realistically I probably won't ever be back to McNally's. \u00a0I did the whole Parade thing but I don't think I'd make a special effort to go again. \u00a0The remaining 364 days a year aren't likely to find me on the south side of Chicago either - I just don't know anyone that still lives there. \u00a0Which is kind of a shame, because I wouldn't mind stopping in one night and cheering on my Cubs.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 9, 23]}, "17": {"description": "I was transported back to Sidetracks in Carondale upon entering this south-side bar stock full of white guys in Big Ten hats - perfectly arched brims, of course.The jukebox would not allow me to play ANY rap except Will Smith. \u00a0I was sad that I couldn't play most of my standard jukebox picks like Back That Ass Up, Watch Yourself, and Juicey. \u00a0Fridays are two dollar shot nights --- hollah. \u00a0I was able to buy two enormous rum and cokes and two shots for $10 - now that's what I'm talking about.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 8, 19]}, "15": {"description": "the service was really bad as bartender ignored me last Sunday.

I bought my deal and received it in under the time which was quoted to me so I was excited to start! I received my package yesterday and opened it. Inside the box it came in were two items the protein powder and the bag of tea. Also included was a print out of how to do the cleanse. I read through it and was disappointed in the fact that I had to make the tea and the protein drink all at once. I really was not fond of the idea of having them sit in the refrigerator all week while I cleanse.. Regardless I proceeded with the directions. I made a shopping list and went out to buy the fruits and fruit juices it suggested. I really liked that they had them pictured and listed to spare any confusion. Once I got home I got ready to make everything, I read the directions on the paper to start the protein drink and then picked up the package it was in to make it and noticed the the paper instructions indicated a different amount of water than the package. I went with the lower amount on the paper directions to spare making it too liquidity. I mixed them in the blender in batches as the amount I was making was bigger than the blender itself. Once I had it all mixed I poured it into the Gallon pitcher I bought to keep it in.. It sat for about 10 minutes while I prepared the fruit (washing and packaging it into bags for work) When I came back to the protein drink to place it into the refrigerator I noticed it had separated bad.. All the mix was at the bottom of the pitcher. :-/ I just figured I would mix it as I poured it each morning. Then came time for the tea... I poured the water (a gallon) into the steal pot and brought it to a boil like suggested, once the boiling started I placed the tea bag into the pot to begin the process (2-4 hours suggested) I kept an eye on it for the first two hours and then ended up falling asleep on accident. Luckily I woke up within the 4 hours and went into the kitchen to check on it and that's when I found the entire gallon of water I had poured into the had evaporated. Now this in no way is a reflection of the product itself as I am the one who fell asleep but I was really irritated!! Why would I need to make a 5 day supply all at once? I would much rather of had individual tea bags to make them as I needed them! I am not sure how this product actually would have worked for me due to the fact that I ruined the tea.. I was extremely disappointed in myself as well as with the kit itself. Even if I had made it all correctly the thought of having 5 day old protein drinks and 5 day old tea grosses me out.

Seriously.I bought this as a groupon and had never done a cleanse before. I drink tea unsweetened most times (unless with a little bit of honey .. WHICH THEY SAY IS ALLOWED) so the tea actually wasn't bad. The protein wasn't bad either - just mixed it with fruit and ice and made a smoothie every morning.Now, I will say that eating fruit for 5 days gets a bit old. For me, I wanted to cry after day 1 and couldn't imagine eating more fruit, however, I actually googled vegetables that are fruit (it's not really cheating ... right?) so I added avocado and tomatos to the lineup. It felt better eating something savory once a day.Of course, the first 2 days were rough. I was going to the toilet often, but that's normal. Your body is releasing toxins and jumpstarting your body. Day 3 and so on were MUCH better. I think your body just goes into shock.Here I am, on the last day of the cleanse! I've had amazing support of friends, family and coworkers and I've dropped 8 pounds. People looking for a quick fix to weight issues, this isn't for you.

Over the last year or so Leona's service, food, takeout/pickup, has become increasingly disappointing. Quality of food and customer relations need some serious attention.- More dirty tables than clean when walking in- Ordered lasagna and it took the waitress close to 20 min to come back and tell us they were out of it.- Waited an additional 25-30 minutes for our second order- Our dirty dishes were never cleared from in front of us- Empty drinks- My food arrived, and after looking at it and one bite later, discovered the pasta had been microwaved, and then cold sauce dumped on top of it. I never knew Pasta was supposed to be crunchy!!!! Seriously? Sent it back. Had the waitress remove it from the bill.- Boyfriends food was at least hot, but the chicken was dried up and hardly edible, I have never seen my boyfriend not clear his plate.- Buzzers and alarms going off in the kitchen (no one is doing anything)Lazy bussers. Lazy manager (standing around doing nothing with a disgusting mess of a restaurant surrounding him) Only 2 waitresses, busting booty, hustling all over the place with absolutely no help from either the staff or manager when absolutely everything was going wrong. I have never had a restaurant make me angry, but sitting there with my boyfriend, having to defend my neighborhood, \" babes, not all the restaurants down here are like this\" But obviously Leona's is.

My wife had a side salad, far cry from the psychedelic salad they used to serve. She also had Romano crusted garlic chicken. That is all that comes on the plate. No side because she had a salad.

Apparently they charge for time on the table - it was extra annoying for us because our food came and they just left the balls on the table and didn't return them until after we ate and we got charged for that time. Oh and a warning to parents with children - the Megatouch by the pinball machine includes \"erotic games.\" I was excited to see Erotic Photohunt (my favorite bar game) but later on I noticed a little girl playing games on there (they do have plenty of non-erotic games - but I probably wouldn't let your children near the machine to be on the safe side.)

Now the lasagna is considered a separate side and you have to pay $6, I believe, extra for it. \u00a0When we asked our waiter about the change he was so rude as if we should have known about the change. The meal that I often got was taken off the menu completely. Leona's has definitely made some bad business decisions when trying to save money.

(As I believe I mentioned in my first review, this is not in Beverly--it is a half mile south of Beverly in Morgan Park. I just like to be accurate.)Anyway, Leona's has morphed from an Italian restaurant that also serves pizza to a pizzaria that serves a few other dishes. Totally different vibe. *They replaced their huge, fun, slightly-retro menu with a smaller menu. Lots of items are gone. Their share-with-another-person desserts are gone. Their slider options are gone. (At least here.) But you can get lots of pizza, lots of different ways! (Thanks, the neighborhood has only about a million pizza joints.)*The prices went up a little but the portions are smaller. *They used to have quirky little things like trivia cards at the table--it made going to Leona's kind of entertaining. Gone. I think the new approach is to get you in and out as quickly as possible. * The food is okay. I ordered an appetizer--pretty good. My husband had the Italian beef, which wasn't exactly an authentic Chicago Italian beef, but it was okay. *The side \u00a0that comes with your meal is pretty small. *The waitress came right away with water and a bread plate. I seem to remember they would put bread out when you ordered. Not anymore. They didn't put out anything, not even a lonely little oyster cracker. Compare this to one of those family restaurants nearby that give you an entire breadbasket loaded with rolls, crackers, and breadsticks before you even order an iced tea.

Tender, juicy, and not over-seasoned as to take away from its natural porky goodness. They're sweet BBQ sauce married flawlessly with every one of my succulent animal proteins. Great BBQ on the city's southside, albeit located in a somewhat precarious neighborhood. Small interior, more geared towards carryout, but outside seating should quell any lunch rush.

I used Yelp to help us find something along 57 that would be easy to get to. \"19 Paul\" BBQ popped up as the #1 option, and the 5 stars caught my attention. Being from Texas, we had to check it out and see what the fuss was about. We have some pretty solid BBQ options down in Austin, so it takes a lot to impress us. We ended up ordering the 3 meat plate, which comes with pulled pork, pulled brisket, and 1/2 smoked chicken. We also ordered a side of cole slaw, just to make us feel like we had \"veggies\" with our lunch. Everything we put in our mouths had both of us making those, \"oh my God, this is so good\" noises. The pork and brisket were amazing - flavorful, tender, with those nice blackened ends - but the chicken....best smoked chicken EVER. Seriously, this place is LEGIT.On top of dining on some of the best BBQ we've ever had, the staff made the experience one we will talk about for years. Once we mentioned we were from TX, a few of the staff members smiled and almost took that as a challenge! It was awesome....they looked at us and said, \"Hold on...we're going to put a flight together for you.\" 5 mintutes later, they came back with small samples of their mac and cheese (also the best I've ever had), collard greens (I could have eaten an entire gallon of these), and some cooked sweet potatoes, which tasted like a Thanksgiving dessert (yum). Towards the end of our meal, the entire kitchen staff came out and asked what we thought about everything. When we said it was some of the best BBQ we've ever had, the main guy yelled, \"We got some new ones!\" and they all started clapping. It was sooo cute and funny and this enthusiasm made us want to stick around and work with them. They were so excited that we loved everything, and it was so obvious that they love what they do. It's rare these days to be around happy, positive people like that...it was such a pleasure to eat here.From now on, we will stop here every time we come to IL to visit my partner's family, and next time, we'll probably order enough food to feed all of my in-laws down on the farm in Gibson City!It's time to unbutton my pants and take a nap now.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 10, 30]}, "18": {"description": "I found 19 Paul BBQ through a cursory Google search and decided to try it on a whim.
