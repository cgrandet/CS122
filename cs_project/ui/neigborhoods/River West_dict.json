If management works a few more kinks out, this could be my go-to sports bar.Came in during their Sunday brunch hours (11AM to 4PM) to watch the Seahawks game. They have a smaller brunch menu available during this time. We got started with some drinks -- my boyfriend had a Revolution beer, but unfortunately my first choice Seattle Cider was sold out. Not ideal, but I settled for a glass of chardonnay. For food, my boyfriend ordered the Korean Wings and I opted for the Turkey Burger. Both items were great, better than standard bar food and came out really hot and fresh from the kitchen. However, the place was severely under-staffed for a playoff weekend game (1 server for the entire restaurant), and service was painfully slow. If we weren't here for a long game, we would have been pretty annoyed. This is no fault to the server on duty, and more a management / staffing problem.An addition issue with this place for sports purposes is TV placement. The bar has dangling light fixtures throughout the front room, and with the TVs flush against the brick walls, the light fixtures get in the way of the picture from various tables. I find myself craning my head to look around the light bulbs. I notice that they do have TV Stands set up in the middle of the bar area, but no TVs set up here yet.

The veggie burger was out in about five minutes, then the chef (sous chef? chef de cuisine?) came out personally to apologize, and offered us a gratis brownie sundae. We tried to say no - servings were big enough to leave us stuffed - but he insisted. It was good - made with Blommer chocolate - and the size was just big enough to split. Loved Black Oak Tavern.

Because let me tell you, to hangry people in search of comfort food on a Sunday night, it's a HUGE deal.So ultimately, you mean to tell me that it would have taken us 2.5+ hours to get our food from a place that is 4 blocks away, and they want to run us in circles and THEN act like it's not really a big deal and is a small mistake???

Great job D'Agostino's, you've managed to pi$$ me off, starve me, and give me an ulcer. That's great work right there.Now, on top of this, I should note:Do not expect high quality meats here. Do not get a gluten free burger, I think McDonald's patties are probably better quality. The gluten free bun was ok, the gluten free pizzas are good, but I haven't tried anything else out of fear.

Luckily for me showing up on a Sat morning didn't mean that I was going to be juxtapositioned between a bunch of yakking ladies, rather it seemed nice and quiet for a noob like me and I was eased into a corner massage chair in the line of sight of a TV and even handed a remote, and I thought to myself \"so far so good!\". The girl who was attending seemed to sense the fact that I was like a Fresh-off-the-boat and wore a smile that seemed to convey that she understood, but once she asked \"Have you had a pedicure before?\", there were no lingering doubts about her intuition.Soon enough I had my feet soaked up in the whirly pool, and shortly thereafter they were being put to the test. I went through all sorts of weird and ticklish sensations (realized just how sensitive and raw my feet are) and as much as I tried to make no bones of it, it was evident and written all over my face I guess. And so my highly intuitive/perceptive nail specialist took notice and reciprocated with a chuckle or a nod of acknowledgement to every little hypersensitive reaction or gasp of mine - she seemed to \"listen\" to my weird inexperienced flat feet that were yelling \"Handle With Care\", and so she made sure to put me at ease. Finally I reached a point where I was actually able to relax and enjoy my massage chair and actually pay attention to what was playing on TV! Oh, and as someone here pointed out - this place is as purple as purple gets - I tried to not be too bothered by it.Towards the end, after my nails were buffed (can't believe I'm saying that!) I was asked what color I'd like.. and I gave her this \"please tell me you're kidding\" look, to which she laughed and so did I, heaving a sigh of relief. But then she suggested I try on some colorless shine, and after a lot of push back, she managed to convince me that my feet will look \"pretty\", and the stronger argument being in favor of \"your gf will love it\" - so I bought it under the condition that this change was reversible. When we got done, it hit me - I've never seen my feet look so pristine (if the term applies) - maybe I was just looking for the word \"clean\" ;-) My nails definitely had a glow that got me a little worried (like about the gender of people I might be attracting), but I kept telling myself - this better be kosher with the gf, cos you know the kind of sacrifices that guys will make.Anyways, I left the salon with a smile on my face and beaming happy feet! And what did the gf think? Well she can't get enough of my new feet ;-) Guess that was a win-win.My gf said I was living proof that they did a really good job, and will be visiting here shortly.

For my birthday, earlier in the year, I brought my parents, wife and my son and daughter. At the end of the meal, my dad insisted on paying for the meal, our waitress, ran his card, and came back, with it already run, and my dad added the tip. About four months later, my wife and I happened to be in Delux, when that same waitress, whose name is Ashley, waited on us that night. She asked if we'd been in a few months earlier with an older man, it took me a bit, but put it together as my dad, plus everyone else in the family, so I asked if that was when she was talking about, and she said yes. Keep in mind, we went to Delux at least once a week, and would order take out at least one to two times per week, as well, typically on week nights, which apparently Ashley doesn't work, or we just never crossed paths with her. Ashley then proceeded to tell us that something was wrong with my dad's credit card, and the charge didn't go through. Number one, remember that she had already authorized it, and brought it back to the table for him to add the tip-if there was a problem with the card, she'd known it then. Number two, my dad uses his Disney credit card for every single thing to earn Disney points, and never, ever had a \"problem\" with it. So, anyways, I told her that I'd check with him to see if the charge went through, to which she protested and said that we would have to pay that night, and I could ask him later, or I could call him right then. I told her my dad isn't up that late at night, well, that didn't matter to Ashley, she added the previous bill from four months prior, to our bill from that night. She related that a manager did this, we've checked and this is ILLEGAL! Furthermore, during that night, Ashley was doing squats against the wall, with some patrons, and gave us some of the worst service, we've ever had. So, I did check with my dad, whom called his credit card company, to which they informed him, that Delux, did in fact run his card for authorization that day, but, drum roll please, they never put an actual charge through. So ASHLEY messed up and didn't put the charge through, she only authorized the card. I have zero problem with paying for the meals, where my problem lies, is, when we come in all the time, and I say I'll call my dad the next day, to check, to make sure his card didn't get charged, that's what you let us do. It'd already been four months since the bill had been improperly handled by Ashley, the business couldn't wait one more day, for regulars, to make sure there wasn't a mistake somewhere? Not to mention, again, that them adding a bill, that someone else had tried to pay, onto our bill, is ILLEGAL! Ashley, and/or the manager that was on duty that night, should know better, than to do what they did, it's a shame that Ashley's mistake on not putting the charge through, properly, resulted in this.

Personally I loved our hood being quiet with local businesses all around, then a few months ago they started remodeling the interior for a 7-11 location. On a side note: this place never closes. Why don't they call it 24/7? It just seems like a better name. When I was a kid I grew up with a 7-11 kiddie corner from my house on the Northwest Side of Chicago. My visits were spent playing video games and grabbing Slurpees (do not tell my parents) but the one thing I always remember was my Mom sending me on errands here. Grab eggs or milk or bread. It was never a lot of stuff but it was stuff we needed and 7-11 was conveniently located to our house. So when I walked in here I wasn't looking for a Slurpee or a Big Bite. I was looking for the items I may need in an emergency. The first thing I saw was a bag of ice. I was so happy to see that because ice is the essential ingredient to any great party. Luckily I've never run out of ice but knowing this would be my future life line in an ice emergency I was excited. While I continued to add things to my future emergency shopping list like beer, lemons and limes. My wife was starting her own future emergency shopping list but it included non party items like fresh eggs and milk. What? No no no those aren't important unless we need to make a breakfast the morning after a party. Oh wait maybe these items need to be on my list too. Apparently I might have to start a pre-party shopping list here. The store is shaped like a triangle. It starts out small and gets wider as you head towards the back. The layout is a little weird but I can get use to it. The aisles seem wide but I'm sure in time they will add more items and this place may get very packed. The Blue Line is right out the front door so you can grab a snack and head to downtown or the airport. It is also on a six corner so major streets connect here: Grand, Halsted & Milwaukee. Yes this is a high traffic area of both cars, bikes and people on foot. So if you are in the area and you need a few emergency items or a quick snack then 7-11 is right here. You also don't have to grab anything bad to eat because they also have fresh fruits like bananas. Yes I know the big bite seems tempting but remember it's been in that roller all day long. There are no excuses when it comes to making a healthy choice because 7-11 has you covered.

Lots of mix-matched kitchen stuff, used electronics, plus a few uninteresting antiques were of little interest. \u00a0This store is more picked over than a farmer's market just before closing. \u00a0I saw a few people buying things, but I left with nothing. \u00a0Thrift shopping is hit or miss. \u00a0You never know what you'll find. \u00a0 Although I can't say anything positive about my experience here, several college-aged friends picking through the clothes were obviously very happy with their finds. \u00a0Someone had donated a lot of Banana Republic stuff with the tags still on them. My search will continue, because once you're bitten by the thrift store bug, it's hard to stop. \u00a0I'm posting a picture of my Fendi bag from the Moline Goodwill to inspire my fellow thrift store shopper.UPDATED REVIEW ON 8/20/2015: \u00a0Stopped in a week ago for the first time since my original review last year. \u00a0It's much improved. \u00a0Better organized, cleaner, and the prices were a little more reasonable. \u00a0The salesperson told me they have a new manager. \u00a0I picked up a mid-century ceramic vase for $20... about $15 less than I saw it on Etsy. \u00a0They still need to do better on the pricing, but I'm giving them an extra star for the improvements.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 10, 6]}, "34": {"description": "If I could give this store 0 stars I would!

My wife and I (both Asian) stumbled upon this place when walking on a date night. Entering into the cavernous cement-walled shop we passed by dust and mildew laden furniture that was basting under low-lit halogen bulbs. This Salvation Army is more of a collection of thrown out garbage than a place of well-cared for collectibles.Still as my wife and I were there, wondering if we could find any worthwhile surprises, we turned the first corner of the main room. That was when we heard the raspy voice. \"Take off your bag and purse. You're going to have to give me your bag,\" the larynx-challenged voice said. My wife and I looked to see where the sound was coming from, and then looked at the small brown leather Calvin Klein bag that my wife was wearing. We walked a couple steps forward and heard the raspy entonement: \"Take off your bag and purse and give them to me.\"As we had passed by some of the shoulder high clutter that was piled up in the center of the room, we saw the old employee who had gasped out the words, standing in front of the cash register table. My wife and I looked around to see whom the woman was talking to. From this vantage point a quick visual sweep of the room showed one other shopping husband and wife couple, a mother and daughter, and a single woman. The four female shoppers who'd preceded us into the store all wore larger bags on their backs or hips than the bag that my wife carried. My wife and I approached the clerk to clarify, and the clerk repeated the demand with a stare. Let me take a pause from this narrative to say that I'm not one to say the sky is falling, so this Salvation Army clerk's behavior was really annoying. By simply turning our necks left and right, my wife and I saw four women who had entered before us, sashaying down the aisles with bigger bags swaying in rhythm. I asked the clerk about the other patrons and if she was going to talk to them about their bigger bags. Her immediate response was (and I kid you not): \"Yes, I'm White. I'm going to talk to them, too. I just haven't had a chance to get to them yet.\" Allow me to point out that I'd asked her about the other customers' larger bags and what the clerk planned to do, yet the employee's \u00a0first response was that she's White. Then there's the fact that the other customers had been walking around for minutes before us. \u00a0Stupid is as stupid does.In embarrassment by the blatant racism, the single female shopper who was standing by the register ready to check out, swung her purse from back to front to show how much bigger her purse was than my wife's bag. My wife began taking out our wallets and phones, while the clerk repeated her self admission. Given the store's treatment, \"offerings\", and the spoiling of an until then perfect date night, I asked my wife to repack her bag as I didn't want to stay in the shop any longer. Its incredible that in this day and age, in a large metropolitan city such Chicago, racism still exists.

I know it would cost more elsewhere, but felt it was overpriced in any case.They did have some nice looking furniture, but again, looked overpriced. Whomever is doing their pricing is having a field day, for sure. Maybe it's because it's kind of adjacent to the downtown area near northish ... they figure they can gauge the downtowners who don't know any better.I have since gone to many other SAs in the region and they were all much better than this one, where I have found linens, coats and other stuff.I have found that the further out I go, the lower the prices are.

The basement, or the bric-a-brac floor, is where I usually spend the most of my time since I collect china.

First, the backs were all totally new and redone, and as secure and sturdy as I could hope for. Nice new wires and good hooks for the walls. The glass was new too, and good preservation quality with buffers to keep the panes away from the art. The landscape was brighter, more vivid than I'd ever seen it.

Mango wasn't listed on the menu but was put on the roll. Not really a fun surprise, when I called to let them know my order was not only incorrect, but that I was allergic to the ingredient they added, the employee on the phone asked what I wanted in return for the mistake. While I asked for a refund for the roll, I just thought it was a little insensitive due to the error being a food allergy issue...and now I had less food! The other thing that really irritated me was the portion of the tuna tartare. I am not sure if they give a smaller portion with to-go orders or if this is their norm, but it was SUCH a sad portion size for $14. It was tiny and there was NO tuna in comparison to all the accompaniments. Really a shame. Ordered a ROK bowl that also lacked flavor, maybe this is better in the restaurant?

The atmosphere is a little too funky for me with a big screen monitor playing Japanese cartoons and such. There's music as well, which got a little too loud at one point, but despite those things, we still had a great time and definitely enjoyed our sushi.So onto the goodies, we started with a spicy tuna salad for $9 which was a decent portion of tons of spicy tuna with spicy mayo and siracha, some avocado pieces on top a bed of lettuce, definitely recommend it. We also got an edamame which was a large portion as well while we waited for our creative and super size make rolls to be made and let me tell you that these rolls were huge. Some of them barely made it in my mouth, they were big so although on the pricier side, they were worth it. -Honey roll for $8 had white tuna, tempura flakes, cucumber, honey sesame mayo. One of the smaller rolls but definitely worth it.-Godzilla roll for $14 which happened to be my favorite one and is definitely worth the hype here had tempura shrimp, siracha, scallions, roe, cream cheese, tempura flakes, avocado, mayo, topped w/ eel sauce and wasabi mayo. Seriously, get it now!-Double Stack for $16 (this one was what my hubby really wanted since it had plenty of raw fish for him to eat, but I have to say I didn't love it, maybe I'm just not a fan of cilantro in my sushi but it was made of tuna, albacore, salmon, cilantro, jalapeno, avocado, mayo, roe, citrus chili ponzu. Definitely an adventure item.So the sushi was awesome overall and definitely filling because the rolls were huge in size and pieces. So the best part was when our super sweet server saw me take a pic of the gorgeousness she said \"hey, if you upload your picture at sushi X on instagram, I'll get you a free dessert.\" Now that gets a star in itself. I love that kind of service, since I would have probably done it anyway. We ended up trying the mango mousse cake with some mochi ice cream, which was light and a great way to end the meal.

I wanted to try a new sushi spot but was disappointed.Went to this place on a Tuesday around 6pm with my partner. I thought it was a cute place because my partner is into anime and they have it playing on a wall with a projector with no sound, only music. The place is fairly small but roomy. The place was dark and lit with candles and some light. I liked it. The place is not as loud as I thought either. There was a boy and his mom sitting 3 feet from us and he was crawling on the floor and looking around looking for a toy in the place and I guess he one something, like a game. It was distracting and the place looked unprofessional. Immediately after picking our table we received paper menus and glasses of water.We started of with the Godzilla roll since I read on here a lot of people enjoy/recommend it. It was my favorite from this place sadly out of 4 rolls. This sushi roll took about 10 min to get to our table. Wasn't even a lot of people. I though they took forever.We got 3 rolls after that and that was it. We got the omega, spider and black widow.Tasted like they out panko in all the rolls.The presentation wasn't worth taking a picture.They all sounded pretty amazing except I wasn't impressed. The tempura tuna in the Omega wasn't as good. The sushi rolls weren't rolled tight. They were falling apart as I tried picking up some pieces. My partner called them amateurs under her breath. I don't wanna \u00a0disrespect anyone's hard work in this place but I called this cheap sushi. Not the best I've had. The service was okay. We certainly didn't get as much attention as the other tables. At the end I paid $63 for all 4 rolls which is decent for the sushi I usually eat. But I felt ripped off because the rolls were disappointing.I don't wanna give them one star because it wasn't the worst place but 2 stars because the sushi was sad.I will not be back here.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 12, 5]}, "43": {"description": "One of my favorite Sushi spots in Chicago The staff are all top notch, and the sushi is great.

The rolls are very inventive. For example, I had the Five-O, which is a roll made with prosciutto and bacon.

Got in around 6:30pm and snatched one of the last 4 top tables there so that was a positive since I hate waiting, especially during winter weather in Chicago. The atmosphere is a little too funky for me with a big screen monitor playing Japanese cartoons and such. There's music as well, which got a little too loud at one point, but despite those things, we still had a great time and definitely enjoyed our sushi.So onto the goodies, we started with a spicy tuna salad for $9 which was a decent portion of tons of spicy tuna with spicy mayo and siracha, some avocado pieces on top a bed of lettuce, definitely recommend it. We also got an edamame which was a large portion as well while we waited for our creative and super size make rolls to be made and let me tell you that these rolls were huge. Some of them barely made it in my mouth, they were big so although on the pricier side, they were worth it. -Honey roll for $8 had white tuna, tempura flakes, cucumber, honey sesame mayo. One of the smaller rolls but definitely worth it.-Godzilla roll for $14 which happened to be my favorite one and is definitely worth the hype here had tempura shrimp, siracha, scallions, roe, cream cheese, tempura flakes, avocado, mayo, topped w/ eel sauce and wasabi mayo. Seriously, get it now!-Double Stack for $16 (this one was what my hubby really wanted since it had plenty of raw fish for him to eat, but I have to say I didn't love it, maybe I'm just not a fan of cilantro in my sushi but it was made of tuna, albacore, salmon, cilantro, jalapeno, avocado, mayo, roe, citrus chili ponzu. Definitely an adventure item.So the sushi was awesome overall and definitely filling because the rolls were huge in size and pieces. So the best part was when our super sweet server saw me take a pic of the gorgeousness she said \"hey, if you upload your picture at sushi X on instagram, I'll get you a free dessert.\" Now that gets a star in itself. I love that kind of service, since I would have probably done it anyway. We ended up trying the mango mousse cake with some mochi ice cream, which was light and a great way to end the meal. So Sushi X is definitely worth trying if you're in the area for some good sushi and great service.

(??) A few minutes later, a Sushi X employee called me and spent five minutes complaining about how terrible Seamless is, how their customer service is awful, it's a horrible organization, etc., and that next time I should order through GrubHub or the restaurant directly. Okay...fine. She clarifies the gyoza thing (which still didn't make sense), and says the delivery guy is walking out the door with my order. Forty-five minutes later, nothing. I call Sushi X back and talk to a very hyper and defensive guy who says the delivery guy \"left his cell phone at the restaurant\" so he can't call him to check on our food. He says I need to wait a full 60 minutes before he can \"make it up to me.\" Not encouraging. Needless to say, the delivery guy never showed up so I called back and the same hyper guy answered and was even more defensive and rude. I said we wanted to cancel the order, and he seemed pleasantly surprised... like he was glad that is all I wanted to rectify the situation. Sounded like this wasn't the first time customers were unhappy with their delivery service. Anyways, I asked him to confirm it would be cancelled and we wouldn't be charged.

I asked for little (or no) mayo and the restaurant definitely honored that request by omitting the mayo from the dressing. That said, perhaps it's because I altered the dressing but the fish, itself, tasted RANCID. It smelled fishy, it tasted fishy... it made me gag. I could not stomach the salad and ended up throwing it away, much to my great dismay.I also got a SILVER HAZE BOWL with sashimi, lettuce, cucumber, scallions, masago, shiso leaf, carrots, daikon and soybean sprouts, sesame oil, nori flakes, and silver haze sauce (spicy red pepper vinegar sauce). This is basically your Korean \"hwe dup bap\" but better. I loved the julienned daikon and carrots but felt like the raw soybean sprouts were too potent and detracted from the other flavors. The silver haze sauce is essentially Korean \"cho-gochujang\" and was very welcome because IT IS SURPRISINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN CHICAGO /end rant. Again, some of the fish tasted rancid so I had to pick them out but, overall, after picking out the soybean sprouts and rancid fish, this was an excellent entree and I would order again.Maybe it was an off day, maybe the fish was off.

The first time a friend and I arrived we bailed after waiting 20 minutes with no end in sight. The place doesn't have a waiting area which is inconvenient to say the least. If I have to wait for a table at least give me somewhere to stand and maybe enjoy a glass of wine or beer while I am waiting. On a side note, the place is BYOB, which everyone loves. Attempt #2: Same friend and I met again and decided to pop in early in hopes of getting a table. Mission accomplished! The whole place is somewhat small and can get loud but I feel that is to be expected in most trendy places nowadays.We started out with the usual edamame and gyoza. They were pretty typical with what is served at other sushi places. We ordered from the Mega side of the menu. The dragon fly was great, the sushi fruit was different (not to my liking) and another staple, the spider. There is a reason these are on the \"mega\" side of the menu. The portions are exactly what they say - mega. Attempt #1: My friend and I met at Sushi X again dinner. Again we were seated right away. We got there around 6:30 pm on a Saturday this time. This time we thought we would venture out of our normal appetizers, so we tried the sashimi carpaccio. There were nice cuts and variety of sashimi and I enjoyed the lightly balsamic touch. We ventured out on the menu you a little more this time. We ordered from the Zero section - bombshell, which I was pleasantly surprised. We also ordered the Red Dragon from the Inside Out section of the menu, The various ideas Sushi X has are cool. Both times I was happy with the quality of the fish, however, when a sushi requires two or three bites I get a little annoyed. I want to be able to enjoy the roll in its entirety.

Magic aura my ass! I went up to examine both boards and started to notice that the spider (metal wire frame of the dartboard) was raised off the board! To hit a bullseye, you would have to shoot through the raised metal ring around it and have the dart stick in! Also the scoreboard was a mirrored surface with black stuff that you could use chalk to write on but the black stuff was gone and only the mirror remained!For pool players this may be a better bar as they have plenty of tables and people ready to play but I think the table fees may be a bit steep.

And while this may be me on the cusp of coffee snobbery, I think weak coffee is the equivalent of pissing into a Keurig.I was dragging myself across Wacker on my way to the office. I hadn't had my morning cup yet, so homicidal thoughts were running pretty high. Just when I thought 20 years in Cook County correctional didn't seem so bad, bam their coffee truck was right there. Literally, I wasn't paying attention to where is was walking and I actually bumped into their coffee truck.Some lady was in front of me taking her sweet ass time completely unaware that she was standing at scene of the July 17th Chicago coffee massacre. (The date this review was written) And just when I had all I could stands and I can't stands no more... she left, a nice young man within the truck provided coffee for $2 (not a bad price) and a disaster was averted. \u00a0Seriously, I wash with powdered soap, I totally can't go to prison! \u00a0Thank you Big Shoulders Coffee! Oh yeah, the actual coffee... Duh. It wasn't the strongest cup of joe I've ever had, meaning I didn't have to chew it. But it was a nice blend of fragrance and acidity. Overall a good choice.

Just like BK, BS will brew your coffee \"your way\": chemex, pour-over, catila. They have specialty lattes and will allow you to smell the syrup if you're hesitant. Had to choose between cardamom spice and toasted marshmallow today, and as big of a chai tea snob as I am, I went with toasted marshmallow. In-house lattes come in glass cups like chai tea does in India. Thick foam that makes you think you're sipping a melted marshmallow. Unimaginable and incomparable sensation unless you try it for yourself. Service was par-excellence. In-house lattes are brought to you at your table. On Twitter?

They opened today at 9 and I was there at 9:15, and neighborhood folks are clearly excited or at least just curious. I saw at least 10 patrons in 10 minutes. They've done really well by the space - new windows, and clean warm decor makes this an inviting space, and the smell when you walk in is fantastic - chicken, spice, biscuits and butter - without the overwhelming quality of fry oil you can find in the air of so many place serving fried food. I haven't been to their other locations, so i was excited to put them to the test. I kept it simple: a chicken biscuit with ranch. I almost never get chicken breast, I usually opt for thigh, but I knew I had to assess them on their mainstay. I saw them brush their signature sauce onto the fried chicken - a technique that saturates it with flavor but doesn't the compromise integrity of the crisp fried batter - or compete with the juiciness of the bird. It wasn't until the third bite in that I noticed the balance of richness in the biscuit just a good richness to complement the juicy chicken and luxe pour of ranch. This is the real deal. Another perk was that the biscuit didn't fall apart as I made my way through the sandwich. The ratios are great, and that attention to detail will continue to serve this place (and me) really well.

That is quite a bold statement so of course I had to try one of these alleged best biscuits, and boy was I not disappointed. These are the best biscuits ever! So flaky, buttery, flavorful and just plain delicious. I went with the chicken tenders since I was on the road and didn't want to deal with bones. \u00a0They don't give you an option for spice level with the tenders as they do the regular chicken and I'm guessing it's just the standard medium to hot. So I was taking a spicy gamble when I ordered them. \u00a0I will say they have a bit of a kick but not too overpowering, just enough for a great spicy flavor and was easily calmed down by honey as a dipping sauce. I'm a dessert whore so I wanted to grab something a little sweet and opted for the peach cobbler. This was the only real disappointment of my meal while decent, it was just that, decent.

The Three Little Pigs is a layer of cheese, topped with breaded pork, stacked with an insane amount of thick delicious ham, crispy bacon curls on top of that, then a fried eggs that has a nice runny center, one big deep fried onion ring,then more cheese on a bun. When you put it all together, its stacked so darn high...the only way to fit it in a mouth is by pressing it down a bit or taking out some of the meats. It's good though. Real good. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it good. It's $13.95 and comes with a side.

I'm sorry, but if you go to an Italian restaurant and you give it 2 stars because you had a headache going in to it and you decided to go at peak time on a Saturday night when it's obviously going to be busy and loud, that's your own fault that your headache got worse, not the restaurants. Obviously if you know enough about Yelp to leave a review afterwards, you know enough to check the reviews beforehand and get an idea of what you're in for, and the restaurant (especially one as incredible as this one) shouldn't be faulted for your own ineptitude. That being said, YES, La Scarola is about as authentic of an Italian restaurant you'll find anywhere in the city and it's amazing in every way. \u00a0The walls are covered with photographs, underneath which are the classic wall murals that highlight scenes from a Tuscan countryside. The restaurant is made up of several rooms, all of which are packed with tables so that you feel like you're eating in someone's house with all of their extended family and friends. \u00a0So is it noisy? Yeah, obviously. \u00a0Is it so noisy you can't hear the person across from you? Absolutely not. But if you're expecting a tranquil, white tablecloth, candlelit dinner, you should probably make reservations elsewhere. \u00a0But if authenticity and delicious food is your thing, keep reading.So we had a reservation for 9:00 the Saturday night before Valentine's Day, which obviously is a busy restaurant night. Having read some reviews that said they are notoriously late with reservations, I called ahead to see if they were running on time (what a concept!) \u00a0They were only running about 10 minutes late, so we headed straight to the restaurant. As soon as we arrived I could see why people said there was little room for waiting, but again, this isn't the restaurants fault---The Dawson, Emmitt's Pub, and Richard's Bar are all literally RIGHT next door to the place, so if you need somewhere to wait you have plenty of options. Since we only had a few minutes, we ponied up to the tiny bar and ordered a beer until our table was ready and it was perfectly fine.On to the food: AMAZING. Even if this doesn't sound like your kind of place atmosphere-wise, you should still come for the food!!!!! Holy crap. \u00a0I don't often rave over taste because I feel that aside from the stand outs, lots of things tend to taste generally the same, but this place is one of the stand outs!! \u00a0I woke up this morning unsure of how I could possibly wait until an appropriate \"lunch time\" to eat my leftovers. Writing this review is part of how I'm distracting myself! \u00a0So, my advice: starve yourself before you go here. Seriously. You want to be able to consume as much as possible, and that's exactly what we did. We started off by ordering the sausage and peppers---INCREDIBLE. And I don't usually like Italian sausage, but my fiance does so we ordered it and I was hooked!!!! \u00a0We also got grilled calamari which was insanely fresh, steak-like and not at all \"rubbery\" as it almost always is. The bruschetta was fantastic too!! After our healthy order of apps, we ordered entrees. I had read rave reviews about the penne a la vodka, but I was also super interested in one of their specials which was the Penne Amore and included a lot more seafood (scallops, lobster tail, shrimp). \u00a0I explained my predicament to the waiter and he immediately suggested that I combine the two and customized my order no problem. And there are no words for what came out of the kitchen 20 minutes later....pure magic. \u00a0One of the best vodka sauces I've ever tasted, and the freshest seafood you'll get anywhere that is not immediately on an oceanic coast. WOW. Wow wow wow. I had dreams about it last night. I'm dreaming about it now!! I'm salivating just thinking about my leftovers in the refrigerator. Especially the scallops...they were so tender, they just absorbed the vodka sauce so they became little vodka sauce bombs that exploded with flavor on each bite!!! Incredible.Okay, this is now officially the longest review I've ever written, so I'm going to wrap it up by adding that the cherry on the top of the La Scarola sundae was the staff---very friendly and attentive without going over the top, or interrupting your meal every 10 minutes to see if you need anything.

Besides the rude and unprofessional staff who removed people from our private party at our leisure, the venue itself was not fun. Guests weren't dancing because there was no clear spot for a dance floor, and compared to the many other venues we've hosted events at, this was by far the most dull, had the worst food (and not much of it at all despite paying a hefty sum for it), and was on the smaller side (especially given the price).I will never be going back to Estate, and given the horrible time that the majority of my guests had, I don't think anyone in the organization will ever be returning again.Edit: Even more disappointing, after our organization's feedback, management promised at least a partial refund to a representative of our organization for members of our party who had been thrown out, which was much appreciated.

There were 2 bartenders and a bar back. The bar back was very nice, and pouring beers, getting cans, but he wouldn't take food orders. He said we had to order from the bartender. I think it confused a lot of people. Besides being under staffed, they also were under supplied. The deal offered select cans and drafts and before halftime, they were out of 3 of the 5 beers being offered. The only option people had was Bud Light and 312 drafts, and some people don't like draft beer for fear of dirty lines and a huge headache the next day. They ran out of Stella before the first quarter was over. I know it was busy, but the bar was offering this deal, they should have known to be ready for a crowd. Lastly, \"beer nuggets\" during the game were included in the package. They set tiny bowls on the bar and it was pretty much a free for all. People were 2 rows deep at the bar reaching over people's heads to grab what they could. I didn't see one bowl get replaced once emptied. So not only were the \"nuggets\" already sparce, once they were gone, that was it. They were gone.

It was our intention to have brunch and sit on the roof. However, we were told that there is NO brunch because it was not the weekend (fair enough it technically wasnt, we assumed that they would do brunch on the holiday, not a safe assumption), and the rooftop is only open at night (a big mistake in my opinion! They are missing out on the summer brunch crowd, who are looking for a great rooftop (check), with a good food and drink selection (check), and located ON the water/ breathtaking view of the city (check). All of which this location boasts, but does not utilize to their advantage!! Additionally, you would think that Estate would indicate somewhere on their website that their roof is only open at night we assumed it would be open when the venue is open (the website says call for rooftop hours of operation, my bad). We arrived around 12:30 and the place was DEAD. But we sat out on their first floor patio right next to the water. We soon forgot about not being able to sit on the roof, although there is a cover over the entire back patio, so you won't be getting much color on nice summer afternoons. But the view is great and you feel like you are on vacation with the boats flying by and docking up to come in for a bite to eat. We ordered some of the specialty drinks and although they are pricey they are VERY tasty (I highly suggest the summer snow or any of the sangria choices they were all phenomenal!!). \u00a0We ordered our lunch options and they were all fine. The only mistake the waitress made was she forgot our calamari appetizer, but brought it during our meal and it was not a big deal at all. I will admit for being SO dead the service was a little slow, but not unbearable. It was a summer afternoon, so we were pretty laid back and parked up for the afternoon. Our waitress was more than accommodating, we asked her if we could see the roof since that's where we wanted to sit originally and she walked us right up there and took our picture. I have to say I would defiantly go back to enjoy a few of their specialty cocktails on that roof! The furniture and decor would remind you of a club in Miami or Vegas. The cushions were bright orange with white trim, eye catching but still elegant. \u00a0The view is very pretty as long as you do not walk to close to the parking lot side. That side looks more like a construction zone as I would assume that areas is still up and coming. Unfortunately for them that side is where the city sky line is, makes for a pretty picture just make sure you stay far enough from ledge. The parking and taxi situation I can imagine would be a huge issue. We drove because it was a Sunday afternoon and we were not planning to drink to heavily. But if it were a Friday or Saturday night it would have been a different story. The parking lot is pretty big, but not big enough if the club was full. My suggestion would be to use UBER. They come on demand and with this location being very secluded (not many businesses and certainly no other bars surrounding it) taxis probably don't come that far off the beaten trail .....

The bouncer was a big teddy bear and valet was super cool! NO ATTITUDES from the staff what so ever.... DJ was really good too.

The list doesnt mention that the options have to be mixed \u00a0drinks. I ask for Beam on the rocks, the bartender gives me an attitude, saying, \"i cant give it to you on the rocks, only mixed drinks\". Fine, so i chose house wine (which is also an option). Im told they are out of it. So you sell me a package deal that doesnt have the option in stock or i cant even get it on the rocks? I go upstairs, try to order an old fashion and they dont have the ingredients for it. I pick out a table and im told i cant sit there because it is for parties and bottle service only. I say fine, bring me a bottle because as you can clearly see, i am with a party. I attempt to order something else besides the bottle given and im told i have to go to the bar or downstairs to get it; very inconvenient but whatever. I finally relax and try to have a good time and a loser tries to pick a fight with my father for being a \"dinosaur\". We finally get our bill and im being charged 300 for 1 damn vodka bottle.

There are a few other reviews here on Yelp which mentions details of how it's been revamped. It is not in any way associated to the uber cool it once, was. It is not an Eco friendly treat. I had high hopes to host a party here after reading through their website and multiple articles I'd read about them on-line some time ago. Too bad I never set my feet in motion to check them out while it was still a big buzz. It's a good reminder that when an establishment is hot, check it out then and don't wait too long. I loved how there was ample information on the website explaining of the affordable party packages involving organic wines, beers and tropical drinks. Pricing was given by the hour. This is not true of the new Butterfly social club. Same rules of Funky Buddha Lounge apply here. $30/$35/$40 for a two hour package, well/call/top shelf. Organic wines and beers only offered with the $40 dollar plan. Don't bother submitting your info via the Butterfly website, that goes unanswered. Better to call and leave a message or try to e-mail Rene or RSVP at funkybuddha.com I sent two emails and left two messages before getting a response. Since Butterfly was under different management before, not one person is completely sure about pricing, offers and the etc's. I did some reconnaissance on a Friday evening to check it out. The moment I walked in I caught a smell of the sewage system and cakes used in their urinals. Ugh! I can't believe that smell caught me at that distance. As I drew closer to the rear of the room the smell grew stronger. Sniffing the air you catch the smells of incense, smells like patchouli. Likely they hoped the scent would mask the odorific sensation of the urinals. White walls, white ceilings, white everything. Wow, how plain. I drove down to the area just to see a white room. Nothing special here. The music was Reggae, Reggaeton and Salsa, not bad, music was pretty good. Women were 21+. Men were mid 20s plus and the oldest in their early 30s, good mix of different people.

Literally at this point I was thinking \"can this get any better?!\"During the haircut Cristian was genuine and we had great conversation. The environment is open, friendly, not snobby at all. The way the salon is set up allows customers to interact with one another too, which is different but cool. He didn't push any products on me excessively, just told me a bit about the hair spray he was using and pretty much let the product speak for itself when he worked it into my hair.

I am extremely picky about my hair, and have gone to enough salons and hair transformations to know what a good cut and color looks like. I had not dyed my dark brown hair for about 7 years, but had been thinking about having the ombre look done to my hair for a couple of years now. Last week I went into Kelly Cardenas to have the ombre done to my hair, where I met Taya, my stylist. I showed her a picture of exactly how I wanted the ombre to look, expressed and reiterated to her how I wanted it to be SUBTLE, how I hadn't dyed my hair in about 7 years so I was nervous, and told her I would like the color to be more on the ends and underneath my hair. Taya basically did the exact opposite of everything that I wanted. When she washed out the color and blow dried my hair, the color was not subtle. The bottom half of my hair had various shades of blonde highlights, and she kept telling me, \"You'll like it when it's all done.\" Needless to say, I did NOT like it when she was finished. I told her it was way too light, and she proceeded to tell me to go home and feel it out for a couple of days, and to come back if I still didn't like it. Knowing right then I didn't like it, I asked her if she could darken the blonde highlights. She ended up putting a gloss toner on my hair to darken everything. My hair ended up looking better than what it first looked like, but I went home still unsatisfied. It was not an ombre, but more like highlights that started from the bottom half of my hair, it wasn't subtle, and it was not the color I asked for. While she did my ombre, she was doing the weaving technique to highlight my hair, I should have known right then it was not going to end well. A couple days later I called back because I disliked everything about the color Taya did, where I was told to come back in and she would fix it. The next week I came in, explained what I wanted again, and showed more pictures of the color I wanted. To my surprise, the ombre turned out WORSE. The top half of my hair was colored black, and the bottom half had more various shades of blonde, nothing was blended, and I just thought I completely ruined my natural hair that I had for so long. I would have been better off never going in to have the ombre done to begin with. Being really upset with my experience, I called back and asked to speak with a manager. The manager told me come back in for a third time to get my hair done by someone with a little more experience. I decided I absolutely did not want to go back to this place again, so I asked for a full refund. This is where the two stars comes in, the manager did not give me a hard time about the refund, gave me all my money back, and had it ready for me to pick up that day. Fortunately, I went somewhere else where they did an amazing job fixing up the botched ombre from Kelly Cardenas. They knew exactly what I wanted, could see exactly what went wrong with the ombre, and used the balayage technique to create my desired ombre.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 8, 19]}, "44": {"description": "Quite possibly the best haircut/style I've had, ever.

I'm so happy she talked me into it. Also a benefit of having color done as well as haircut I did two shampoo room visits today. It was heaven. Honestly the young lady who shampooed and massaged today was outstanding. I love that room and gladly make the half hour drive to experience it. I also need to add: Somehow I ended up confusing my appointment time and showed up 2 hrs early. They graciously fitted me in.

It's energetic and the people are quite friendly. The service is also very good. They will run and refill your meter for you if time is running short. The shampoo area is in a separate room with dimmed lights and soft music, and the massage is lovely. But this is about it for what good I experienced here. I originally called asking to see a senior stylist that same day, explaining that I have dealt with beginner stylists before with disastrous results. They had none available that day - fair enough - and offered to have me see one of their junior stylists who was very experienced and skilled with long hair. I expressed my concern and they were very reassuring so I thought I would take a chance. Bad idea. When I arrived, I was sitting and waiting for at least 30 minutes past my appointment time. They also don't have assigned stations for their stylists, so if all the seats are full when your shampoo is done, you are basically just waiting in the colouring area with your wet towel until one opens up. This isn't something I would not come back for, but it would have been nice to know ahead so I could factor in the extra time into my schedule. After a long wait, I had a stylist come to greet me and take over ... not who my appointment was supposed to be with. At first I thought he was just shampooing my hair, and I eventually asked about the mix up. He said he was assigned to me and didn't know why the confusion. This was the first major aggravation. I have no idea why I didn't see who I was scheduled to see. I found this extremely unprofessional, especially considering no one addressed it with me prior to the appointment starting. I very specifically explained what I was looking for and the problems I have had in the past and the way my hair works. I wanted thicker layers, chunkier face framing layered bangs no shorter than below my eyebrows, and a slight trim. To avoid confusion, I provided pictures. Long story short, I came home with a haircut that brought me to tears. It was nothing like what I asked for, and in fact my hair looked in worse condition than when I arrived. It now looks like dry straw, with layers that looked frayed and sheared. And the \"bangs\" were a nightmare: wispy, shorter than what I asked for (which I pointed out to him and received no response or apology) and looking like a 5 year old attached my hair in my sleep. I can see why some people like this place. The service apart from the haircut is good, but the actual haircut itself was a nightmare. The stylist I saw clearly had limited experience and was just spewing out information he obviously just learned in school. I haven't walked away from a haircut this upset for 10 years.

An hour later, I had short hair and bangs that looked EXACTLY like the photos but somehow better? I have no idea how he did it, but it was amazing. He even showed me a few ways of styling it.

You know Ralph...the whacky landlord from Three's Company, the show that turned the art of misunderstanding into an eight season hit sitcom in the late 70's / early 80's. Many an episode would include Mr. Furley listening in on something and getting the wrong impression. His eyes would bug out and he would get all irritated and uncomfortable like. Whether it was stuffing a chicken or a cooking pot, Mr. Furley always got it wrong. So what is the connection? Well on just about every occasion I have been here someone invariably walks in and thinks this is a butcher shop. What follows is Mr. Furley-like eye bulging and body twitching as it sinks in. This is a packing house. Yet, despite the fact that it is in the name even, this establishment seems to be punished for what it is not even though it never claims to be a butcher or meat market! I even see it in some of the reviews.Our family is intimate with how food sources. My parents, aunts, uncles raised whatever they ate in the mountains of Greece and that was the only source for food. The whole lamb I get from Halsted Packing House (on four occasions now over three years) has been the closest to the real deal. When lamb is fresh, you do not need to do much to it (salt, pepper, oregano, garlic) and everyone just loves it! That has always been the case with anything I procured from Halsted Packing House.I will spare the details it but suffice it to say, you're cutting out the middleman. With that said, you're also cutting out the frills of having things presented in a manner that eases your conscious a bit. Perhaps this may be due to having been conditioned to detach from where our food really sources from when we visit the local grocer. \u00a0I'm not saying one is better than the other...it just is. However, there is substantial cost-advantage to cutting out the middleman. The 35# whole pig I got last week set me back just $122 and it was FRESH!

I chose the pork *oink oink*, sweet plantain, festival, slaw, and ciltantro lime aioli (THAT SAUCE SHOULD'VE BEEN A RED FLAG BUT WHATEVS). I proceeded to calmly ask where the restroom was even though it felt like I was about to explode & there was a tumultuous war going on in my innards.

So then I stepped up to order and said \"Wah Gwaan\", the guy at the counter looked dumbfounded like I was speaking a foreign language. He didn't comprehend a basic Jamaican Greeting (This is a Jamaican Restaurant right?). We joked it off and proceeded with the order.I ordered a Jerk Chicken entree and my Co-worker ordered some Jerk Wings. Now, I've been eating Jerk for a VERY long time, been to some of the best Jerk spots to some of the worst but this is the 1st time I ever got \"slits\" of what he said was boneless skinless chicken. The counter guy went as far as to put the few slits of chicken on a scale (which was annoying). He deducted what I thought should be on the platter. Serious red flags are ablazed!Authentic Jerk Chicken is usually a couple quarter chickens chopped with a cleaver. I slid down the counter and got Rice n Beans as a side and was more throwed back when the other hispanic guy gave me a mere scoop of it. At this point I knew that I wasn't in an Authentic Jamaican Food Restaurant. (Looks like Chipotle Mexican Grill employees).I looked at the total for the entree along with Soda and then looked at what I was getting. I couldn't help but to look at my co-worker and laugh as we both shared an unspoken joke.To make a long story short we go to the table and just as I thought the jokes were about to end. They bring my co-worker his 6-wings. Lo and behold, there not whole wings. They're pieces of a wing. Jokes and Laughter continues!The only good thing we spoke about this place is the decor.

The servers and even Cooks were all Non Jamaicans.When I go to Chinese spots, I'm served by Chinese People. When I eat Mexican Food, I'm served by Mexicans, When I eat Greek food I'm served by Greeks. When I eat African Food, well you get the picture...Based off this experience I won't be back.

As a tag-along one fine Thursday, I was introduced to the sweat-inducing magic of the Rude Girl chicken with seasoned fries. Their Chicago & Halsted shop was hotly anticipated since and thanks to Yelp, the boy and I trekked over on a rainy evening. LINE OUT THE DOOR!I'd liken the dining experience to that of \"Green Streets Smoked Meats\". There's a fully outfitted bar that's separate from the food counter. You pick a meat and the guy behind the counter slices, dices, then weighs the portions. He'll plop it onto a tray and slide it down the line for choice of sides (island slaw included), a sauce, plus any extras. Their shop has expanded choices of sides such as salted potatoes, coconut black bean rice, and mac-n-cheese. Plus you can enjoy their meats as sliders, on top of salads with other extras like yuca fries and beef/veggie patties. The chicken was just as magical as I remembered. The boy got the Rude Girl, but I decided to give my bowels a rest and try their Jerk BBQ sauce. If you're not willing to sweat it out, their BBQ sauce is a safe bet. There's also an aioli as a third option. After trying the coconut rice and mac-n-cheese, my favorite's always the tried-and-true seasoned fries. Even though it's an extra, this is a must-order!Since Jerk's been open for less than a week, I expected some bumps. The staff was still figuring out their rhythm amongst the dinner rush. When ordering an extra, like fries, they hand you a tiny laminated label that sits on your tray after you pay and sit down.

When I first moved to Chicago, it was extremely difficult to find a place that provided authentic Caribbean/Jamaican food.

From the friendly staff, to the atmosphere, the food and last but not least, the drinks make you feel like you're on the beach in Jamaica or many miles away in a tropical paradise.I've read some reviews that mention that its \"not authentic\" jerk. Had they taken the time to read the entire name of the restaurant -- they would have noticed the words \"Modern Jamaican Grill\"! Meanwhile, coming from Caribbean roots, I can authentically say that Jerk is DOING the damn thing and they're doing it right!! No, you won't find ox-tail, brow stew chicken, or \"manish wata\"-- but what you will find is authentically jerk seasoned boneless, skinless chicken breast, pork, and beef - all grilled and/or smoked to perfection. The sides are just as authentic with options that include: plantains, seasoned mac & cheese, coconut rice/peas and cilantro corn.In addition, other offerings include seasoned Yuca fries which offer crunchier and better health benefits over traditional french fries (which are also fantastic), sliders, probably the best wings Chicago has to offer (Jerk chicken wings). For all you vegetarians out there - I'm pleased to announce that they offer veggie patties, salads and island slaw for you as well!Do not forget to visit the bar and order my favorite - RUM PUNCH! There are so many other options available too. Every bartender is super friendly and very attentive (even when busy).Sauces are on point. Rude girl is a favorite, but, if you are looking for that extra \"kick\" try the \"Rude Boy\" sauce. I promise to all those who think the chicken isn't spicy enough, you'd be begging for some rum punch to wash it down with. ;)In a nutshell, Jerk is a modern twist to traditional Jamaican/Caribbean barbecue and offers its customers a 'fast-casual' type of ordering.

I was really stalking the restaurant opening for one reason and one reason only - Jamaican Meat Patties!!! After eating a dozen or so meat patties on a vacation to Jamaica I simply could not get them off my mind. A year or two later the Jerk food truck started showing up at my place of employment and to my delight they had meat patties that did not disappoint. Flaky, buttery crust and spicy beef filling just like the ones I had in Jamaica! Fast forward, a year when I'm working at a new place with no access to the Jerk truck and desperately craving a meat patty. Needless to say, I was SUPER excited when Jerk finally opened.I think it would be a fair statement that you probably don't want to eat here if you're not into the spices. Almost everything on the menu packs a pretty solid punch of spice. While dining in with a friend we had the jerk pork and jerk chicken both of which came with a hush puppy (although I don't believe that is their name for it), cole slaw, and a side of your choice. We both chose mac and cheese. And of course, I also got a beef patty on the side. The beef patty was phenomenal (but I knew that already). Both of the meats were excellent, moist and full of flavor. All of the sides were fantastic as well. The mac and cheese is super cheesy and delightful and has that kicked up spice that Jerk Modern Jamaican Grill does so well. Obviously I'll be back to eat ALLLLL the meat patties but after sampling the meats I think it's quite clear to me that I'll be loading up on the jerk proteins too.

She listened to my entire shpiel, asked me questions, and then laid it out for me - what kind of hair digital perms are for (they're actually for people with straight hair), what another perm would do for me, and how a keratin treatment would improve my hair health, shine, and frizz (especially since the warm weather is approaching). This was ALL before we even got started. Brittany took her time on EVERYTHING, stayed late after closing hours to make sure my haircut was perfect after the keratin was done, and was an amazing stylist. I was looking to cut my hair primping time in half - since I have a lot of hair, it can take me over an hour to do my hair everyday before work. So Brittany suggested the keratin treatment, because it takes all the time I spend blow drying, out of the equation, and I can still curl and style my hair when the keratin loosens up. It hasn't been 24 hours yet and my entire office has told me how amazing my hair looks. Kala salon was recommended to me by another salon, after I had a consultation with them and scheduled an appointment, they called me a week later to tell me they didn't feel comfortable performing my perm, but told me to call Kala, because they are the best.

I decided on Kala Salon and I am so happy that I did!Brittany gave me an amazing cut! My hair is semi-damaged from extensions, straightening and coloring. However, I left Brittany's chair with my hair feeling healthy, looking shiny and feeling great! I hate when hair dressers do what they want with your hair, despite you telling them what you want. I showed Brittany some pictures of the style I wanted and she gave me exactly that!!! Brittany was friendly and personable - but not overly intrusive like hair dressers have the image of being. She also is very knowledgable and tells you, as her client, little tips and products she would recommend that won't break your budget. The salon is cute, comfortable and in a good location - very modern feel. Everyone there was friendly and professional. I would recommend Brittany to ANYONE!

I expect up-do hair styles to stay put like a statue until the girl unpins it at the end of the night. \u00a0Overall - this is the 1 and only vendor from my wedding that I cannot recommend. \u00a0The schedule delays were beyond frustrating and I'm disappointed I paid for a pricey service only to have sub-par results. \u00a0In bringing these issues to Crizen, she apologized profusely and offered salon, hair or make-up services for a future event. \u00a0I do believe her apology was sincere, but she failed to follow through on her offer after I accepted her apology and provided my contact information. \u00a0Therefore - just a disappointment and I would caution other bride's considering using Crizen's stylists.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 10, 12]}, "26": {"description": "Crizen did my hair and make-up for my wedding in August 2008. \u00a0She rocks! \u00a0She somehow managed to give me a gorgeous up-do for my wedding even though my hair was quite short at the time. \u00a0She totally listened to me at our trial to create a style and look that was funky and unique. \u00a0I'm not one to wear earth tones, despite the fact that everyone says you should stick to neutrals for your wedding day. \u00a0The make-up stayed perfectly all day despite the warm August weather.She was very accomodating and also did the hair for one of my bridesmaids. \u00a0I appreciate the fact that she was willing to work with me even though she could have booked another wedding that had a larger bridal party (and would = more money for her). \u00a0I would absolutely use Crizen again (except that I only intend to get married once). \u00a0I guess I'll just have to find a fancy party for an up-do!", "rating": "5", "date": [2009, 11, 16]}, "27": {"description": "Crizen did an exceptional job for hair and makeup on my wedding day and rehearsal dinner.

(Pause ... still pausing)The service, much like at Simply Thalia, was inviting. They had lychee juice, so that was a good beverage option. The ginger chicken soup reminded me of tom yum gai (chicken). That was the highlight and a soup option I would gladly indulge during the cold months in Chicago. Where it all fell apart was with the Indian chicken makhani. Indian food is my favourite ethnic cuisine and that means I have a tendency to be more critical of said cuisine because I love it so much. As wonderful as the presentation was, the dish failed in terms of flavour. The average American may find the chicken makhani to be very appetizing. However, having a palate that is accustomed to a bloom of rich flavours, I cannot cosign that the dish would satisfy those who love spices.Thalia Spice seems to cover the gambit of Asian cuisines. That could be both good and bad. It's good from the standpoint that a patron can have one-stop options for their dining experience. It's bad from the standpoint that something gets compromised and shortcuts get introduced into the cooking at times.

(Pause ... still pausing)The service, much like at Simply Thalia, was inviting. They had lychee juice, so that was a good beverage option. The ginger chicken soup reminded me of tom yum gai (chicken). That was the highlight and a soup option I would gladly indulge during the cold months in Chicago. Where it all fell apart was with the Indian chicken makhani. Indian food is my favourite ethnic cuisine and that means I have a tendency to be more critical of said cuisine because I love it so much. As wonderful as the presentation was, the dish failed in terms of flavour. The average American may find the chicken makhani to be very appetizing. However, having a palate that is accustomed to a bloom of rich flavours, I cannot cosign that the dish would satisfy those who love spices.Thalia Spice seems to cover the gambit of Asian cuisines. That could be both good and bad. It's good from the standpoint that a patron can have one-stop options for their dining experience. It's bad from the standpoint that something gets compromised and shortcuts get introduced into the cooking at times.

Clay pot mussels, lobster chip ceviche, mango seared scallops, chicken satay, and some Laotian beef. Everything was pretty tasty, but none of those items would be the subject of my cravings! We washed down our appetizers with the sangria...which I really enjoyed! I loved the lychee in it...yum! :) For my main course, I ordered the Panang Curry. It comes with rice, but I substituted it w/ the naan. The menu calls it naan (Indian paratha), but it was more like Malaysian roti. I think they should clear that up on their menu...naan and paratha are two different types of breads. Sorry for that side note. Anywho, the curry was decent. Good amount of spice. My only gripe is that the \"naan\" that I ordered (mind you there is an upcharge) was so tiny for the massive amount of curry they served. My \"naan\" was finished in a few bites and is nowhere the size of a \"real\" naan bread. So, skip that upcharge and stick to the rice! We didn't order dessert. Service was decent. They forgot a couple of our friends' meals. That always annoys me and shouldn't be a mistake that is made in restaurants! And my \"naan\" came out about 10 minutes after my curry.

The scallops were tough to get down, so I left a lot of them uneaten. They were a bit dry and gummy, and the taste was very fishy. You'd think the salad would be better, perhaps able to disguise the scallops' taste. But no. The avocado was OK, but the tomatoes used in it (surprise guest...but I like tomatoes so it was OK) were a bit mealy. And the mango chunks themselves were slimy and well past their prime. The mango had acquired a bit of an \"off\" taste that was bad on its own, and extra bad when combined with the \"off\"-tasting scallops as well!

She brought something else, but still charged me for the Red Wine Experience. \u00a0Not much of a \"promise\" if you still charge me even if I don't like it. \u00a0When it came to the food, I tried three of their cheeses. \u00a0Three cheeses is $24. \u00a0At Naha, you can get a cheese plate with 6-8 cheeses for $28, with better accompaniments, and they're in the heart of River North not on an abandoned stretch of Milwaukee, so I'm not sure where the price point comes from. \u00a0Of the three cheeses, two were ok, one was quite good.I also ordered an endive/tuna salad. \u00a0The menu said the tuna was made from belly, which is usually best just plain so the higher fat content can really shine. \u00a0But they'd made it into a tuna salad mash, where the benefit of it being belly is completely lost. \u00a0It tasted fine, but I think turning belly into tuna salad is silly and a waste of money on their part.After I'd eaten, it started to rain. \u00a0I took the better wine with me, and left the \"Experience\" wine on the table - that's how much I disliked it. \u00a0They didn't bring it in or ask me about it.Inside, it was lively and I talked to some local patrons. \u00a0They were friendly and nice and made it a pleasant evening. \u00a0Overall, I'd say I was disappointed mainly due to price. \u00a0The service wasn't horrible, the food was acceptable and most of the wine was good. \u00a0But they were all more at a neighborhood level, yet they were charging downtown prices. \u00a0I can't justify spending over $100 for dinner for what was really at best an average experience, and it really did bother me a lot to be charged for a wine I obviously didn't like - no other restaurant I've been to would do that, so I'm not sure why 694 thinks that's acceptable practice - it's a deadly fault for a wine bar.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 8, 1]}, "23": {"description": "I came here with my boyfriend on a rainy Thursday evening when I realized my $100 groupon was about to expire. I'm very happy I didn't let this one go to waste because it was wonderful!I showed up just as it opened and was seated immediately. The boy was running late, so I ordered a glass of wine (vinho verde, my favorite!) and looked over the menu while I waited for him. Honestly, I could have ordered everything. The whole menu sounded delicious. While it is a small menu, it's more than made up for by the quality of menu items. I decided to put in for an order of Devil's Bread so it would be coming out right around when the boy showed up.He ordered the Prairie Path when he arrived, despite not being gluten free, and said it was great. The Devil's Bread came out and was akin to a very fancy french bread pizza, with spicy salami. Delicious! It sounds simple, but sometimes simple can be simply great! We decided to order the hot sopressata (sp?) and the mole charcuterie, along with the delice de bourgogne and cheddar cheese. The plate came with nuts, honey, and dried fruit, and a generous amount of bread. All SO tasty! The mole was incredibly unexpected, as it was very sweet, but went very well with the creamy cheese. I ordered another glass, this time the rose cava. While it was tasty, it was a bit too sweet for my liking. He ordered a glass of the Red Wrangled (I think that's what it was called), a mix of a few different reds. I wish I had ordered that too! So good! For dessert, we split the brownie flight, which I can only describe as orgasmic. Good lord. So good. We didn't quite hit the $100 with all that, so we split a glass of the Red Wine Experience of the Week, which, once again, was delicious.

Waitstaff is extremely friendly, explains the wines well, and is attentive to the glasses as they get low.For me there were a few highlights here that I don't see often or ever at other places.1) There is a BUTTER & SALT appetizer: Served with sliced Red Hen baguetteThree amazing butters from three amazing regions, paired with three equally amazing sea salts. 8One was hints of parmesan, one was cow with a black salt, one was goat with a red salt. The salt really brings out the taste in the butters and you've never been so excited for a butter appetizer.2) On Wednesday nights only the owner grills on the charcoal grill, this time making amazing chicken and pork chops. The pork came with a hint of mango, steamed asparagus, chives, and was terrific. The sign of good pork grilling: ability to get some edge on the outside while not drying out the inside but still bringing it up to medium or medium-well.3) Wine appears to rotate regularly and is carefully selected.

After reading some really negative reviews here I decided to give my two cents and explain why I love this place so much. In the process I plan on addressing some of the complaints I've seen on their yelp page. Firstly, the coffee shop is very nicely decorated and isn't crammed at all. So, coming here for an afternoon get together with friends over some coffee and food is aesthetically pleasing. I was always greeted by the staff nicely and felt welcome. Speaking of the staff, one of you guys is owed a huge thank you for helping me get my friend out of the restroom that wasn't even locked (said friend is simply confused by how doors work). Thanks for helping and laughing it off. Since I've been here quite a few times I can speak for several dishes that I personally enjoy: Savory- Italian sandwich (get the potato salad as a side, much better pairing than pasta salad), carbonara and napolitan pasta, tirokafteri and the Mediterranean plate are great appetizers. They make a good club sandwich as well. If you want a lighter option their salmon salad is a good choice.Sweet- the Greek yogurt and Nutella & banana crepe. Coffee- I've tried a bunch of their coffees, they make European style coffees that taste great. But I'm not going to give suggestions for the coffee, they have so many options I can only suggest you get adventurous and try something you haven't had before, or explore the different syrup options for a custom drink. Now that food and drinks are covered lets talk about the service pace. Yes, it takes a while to get the check. The famed European style service that I hear about and experience a lot when dining in Eastern European places around town (and, well, in Eastern Europe in general) is present here as well. It truly is a thing, and I firmly believe it is due to trying not to have the patrons feel rushed, as opposed to what others have said (facebooking and ignoring patrons for no reason). Having that said, your water glasses will always be full and you will have ample opportunity to order additional items off the menu if you so choose. In a hurry? Don't appreciate the European dining pace? Me too! So now that you've been warned, make sure to mention to your server that you'd like the check to come out with your food and it will. Problem solved. As for the review about split checks and being forced to order food... I split checks just about every other time I go here and it is never a problem. You were asked to order something at a place of business that offers food and beverages? How shocking! Iguana might have a homey feel to it but you are not, in fact, in your own living room. Another thing I should mention for those that live or work around the area but are in a rush and don't have time to sit down and enjoy a meal- call them about 15 minutes before you can come in and place a to go order, your food will be waiting for you and you can merrily go on with your day. Iguana saved me from plenty of bad lunch option days at UIC.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 7, 20]}, "24": {"description": "Decent small place, we went in there last week for brunch. We went more for the food advertised than the coffee part.

We shared the crab/cheese dip app and it was also very good. In fact it was probably the best tasting thing of the whole time we were there. My wife had the chicken sandwich and complained it was very dry. The staff didnt seem too motivated to be serving but we were there early around noon, not sure if thats an excuse or not but whatever.

My wife is an experienced bartender so on top of me knowing good drinks thanks to her I also know and understand the level of certain places a place can offer and what can be expected. But there was honestly no excuse for this poor Bloody Mary. They couldve AT LEAST added some lime, and 3 olives as a garnish and it wouldve been an attempt, hell a pickle, celery stick. Salt on the rim, SOMETHING. Haha i never expect a fancy tower of garnishes and a bloody mary that has to be prepared by a chef type of deal but like I said...its not hard to put a toothpick through 3 olives, a squirt of lime and maybe a dash or two of hot sauce and your off to a good start lol.

Now, Dunkin's coffee isn't as high-quality and they probably don't actually cold-brew the coffee, so let's throw that example out. If you wanted a 16 oz cup of cold brew here in Chicago, you could go to Intelligentsia (nectar of the Gods) and get one for $3.75. Okay, comparable price. How about Starbucks? $3.25 for their new cold brew. And again, the coffee is pretty damn good! I have no qualms with the quality of the product here, just the price of it. I thought it was just my small-town mentality, but speaking with the natives in my office, nobody thinks this brew is worth the price-tag.

However, at Cafe Blue they will charge you the exact same amount AND refuse to fill your coffee higher than what their cups fill, despite not wasting or using the cost of a cup they wouldn't give a little more coffee or comp the price for bringing my own cup. In asking about this, the woman at the register told me their coffee beans are much more expensive than Starbucks and the cups are basically of no cost. These magic beans do not taste too magical. I still prefer Starbucks any day of the week! Nice to see that Cafe Blue is not environmentally conscious and do not value their neighbors in the \u00a0building.... When Love's cafe was here, everyone in the building ate breakfast, got their coffee, and had lunch there. Value your customers, don't rip them off.

Your sugar packets left on the counter cost more than that per serving.

My son recently moved to the Ukranian Village and several times a month, I visit him. Our 1st experience with Windy City was noteworthy. Our server, Mujju was informative and attentive. The food quality was superior to other cafes/diners. I told our waiter I had to pay for parking on the street, cause the Cafe is located on one of those weird 6 corners of Chicago. He informed us that parking parallel to the diner was allowed and free and they had a private lot in the back. Good tip!This past weekend, we had the opportunity to dine at Windy City for a 2nd time....yeah! Parked in their private free lot... yeah, again! This time we arrived at the height of Sunday Brunch, 12/noon. Not to panic, the Host was like a orchestra conductor. He took names, watched when guests would leave, so he could clear the table(s) for the next guests, processed payments, and basically pitched in where help was needed. Gotta say, when you have a line of hungry guests at your door, I appreciate the extra effort a Host helps his team.Our waiter, Ross H. was awesome! Friendly, attentive and a sense of humor.

It's \"smallness\" forces you to meet new people. Hanging out at the Matchbox is kind of like drinking with my brother. Like my brother, the Matchbook is dimunitive in size, lives off the blue line, and doesn't really bat an eye if you fart. Even if you've never been there, it has an \"everyone knows your name\" familiarity that larger, less tattooed, more successful bars (brothers) can match. I like dive bars, primarily because they usually lack the requesite 25 Flat Screen televisions on the Sportscenter loop. It seems to me that the less \"entertainment\" at the bar, the more human interaction. Well, the Matchbox adds the element that every time that you want to go to the bathroom, order a drink, or turn around, you're literally bumping into another patron. some might rate this as a negative, but it was kind of cool to be absolutely FORCED to meet the people surrounding you at the bar. Matchbox DOES have a small television right above the door. It was playing \"Last House on a Dead End Street,\" a 70s slasher movie. The aforementioned restroom is unisex, and at the far end of the bar from the entrance. It was pretty clean.The Box had an incredibly impressive selection of craft beer and spirits. Only 3 draught beers, but a good selection of local midwest microbrews from Bells, 3 Floyds, Left Hand, and Great Lakes. Behind the rail, the Box has 10, 12, and 15 year old Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon... pretty much the most delicious bourbon in the world. You know it's good because it's featured prominently on the TV show \"Justified\" - a drama where a Sherrif's Deputy drinks bourbon and/or moonshine, slays all of the goodlooking babes in this town, and shoots with impugnity (because it's justified).

My initial call with Amie was very pleasant and I was able to schedule an appointment within a few weeks. First impression is her salon is so cute, inviting and very clean. Amie was also a delight from the moment I walked through the door. We first sat and chatted about my hair concerns and what I am looking to achieve. I have naturally blonde hair with blonde balayage highlights... at least that's what I've been wanting. The salon/stylist I visited the previous three times I had my hair colored ended in results that I did not like. I have been trying to achieve a very cool, creamy blonde color but ended up with awful yellow balayage highlights. On top of that my roots were colored to be very warm, which is exactly the opposite of what I wanted/asked for. I was told by the previous stylist that my hair could not get to the color I wanted and that my hair is \"stubborn\". I knew this wasn't true as my hair has been highlighted cool blonde most of my hair coloring life. Anyway, that made me search for a new stylist and I am so grateful I found Amie! She listened to every single concern I had, explained the best way to get my color where I wanted then did her magic. She is a true hair artist. The color turned out way better than I expected, she transformed my yellow blonde hair to the beautiful cool, beige blonde exactly like I had envisioned and almost given up hope I could achieve. She also managed to tone down the brassiness of the base color so now the colors blend beautifully. I have not felt this great about my hair in so long and it's all thanks to Amie. Also, she is extremely friendly and easy to talk to. I've already recommended her to multiple people looking for a new stylist, they see the amazing transformation of my hair so her work actually speaks for itself.

You'd think the honeymoon would be over after all this time, but I still get as much out of my sessions now as I did back in 2010. The advantage of sticking with Riverwest Fitness is that it gives Heidi time to know your body. She's helped me through several (non-Pilates) injuries over the years, as I'm quite accident prone - and always knows how to modify exercises so that I'm getting maximum workout within my own range of motion.A great thing about both Heidi & Abigail is that if you tell them what you want, they LISTEN and DELIVER. Just this last week I told Heidi I wanted to work on my arms. 2 days later, I was still feeling the burn. During massages with Abigail, when you tell her the areas that need attention, she not only massages those areas, she also kneads the surrounding musculature and tendons to make sure the source of the knot has been addressed.

I feel better, look better, and actually look forward to my workouts now. Everyone here is super friendly, dedicated to their profession, and very well trained & knowledgable. \u00a0No two sessions are the same, and Annette always seems to know exactly what I need to work on every time I come in. The second floor studio space is beautiful! (I'd love to have an apartment like this place...) Very open with hardwood floors, very high exposed timber ceilings, and exposed brick walls. The equipment is new and very well arranged. They do an amazing job of keeping everything clean, safe, and very well maintained. All sessions are by appointment, so it's never crowded and there is no need to ever feel self conscious about anything. One of the areas even has the ability to be closed off for privacy or just to not disturb anyone else. If you haven't worked out before, if it's been a while, or if you just need a little extra help or motivation...I highly recommend coming here! They even do boxing lessons, massage, and a few other things; you'll never be bored. I wasn't sure what I wanted or needed, so I sent them an email. I received a phone call the next morning from the owner.

On the river? I'm in!Normally a $10 admission, I took advantage of a early family hours special (free until 3 pm on Friday). It looks like they are going try and utilize the Freedom Center (so that's what it's called) as an event space more and more. They had used it for a haunted house last October, and now it makes for a relatively accessible event space with some degree of parking.There's 12 places that are serving ribs, a mixture of local places, and a number of out of state places (even one from Ontario, Canada!). Given that I was trying to try this during lunch, I could only have so much, so here's what I tried:Texas Thunder:Pork Sandwich for $7The pork was tender and juicy, but in a way that was somewhat unremarkable despite my choice in adjectives. There were 3 sauces you could add to taste: Mild, Sweet and Spicy. Although there was spicy to their spicy, it just tasted like they added black pepper to one of their base sauces, versus blending something differently. The sweet was average at best.Famous Dave's:1/2 slab rib for $12Given a light brush of original sauce, you'll also have the option of adding some additional original or spicy. These sauces were a bit more distinctive and the meat was thrown back on the grill before serving. The meat was juicy and fatty in the right spots, almost cleanly off the bone. A good way to cap off my rib eating for lunch. There was a 1/3 slab option which I probably should have done instead, and dinner options with bread and beans.Original Rainbow Cone:Small on a Waffle Cone $4.Yes, yes, I know there's one on State Street now, but I couldn't resist.There are two main stages for music, plus a lounge area that I didn't get to check out.

Very few dessert options. (That's important to me and many others I am sure.) It's still ten bucks with less vendors and no carnival.After all, it looks like a glorified parking lot. Oddly enough, some vendors had packed up and left by 2pm.Still a great option for ribs though, it had a good variety of local and not so local rib vendors. Winner: Texas Thunder ribs, in which the meat fell of the bone and *shock* didn't need no sauce. Johnson's came in second, but it was slathered in sauce and really...could you go wrong with bbq sauce on grilled meat? Jacks and Rasta in third for taste. However, Rasta gave me a large slabs of jalapeno cornbread and they had the best sauce overall. They had plenty of bands and two stages, and that does give it a nice fest-feel to it.

Need protein? Hard boiled eggs \u00a0$0.75 \u00a0and Planters salted cashews are $1.00. If you forgot your smokes, you can buy them here too for 12 bucks. There is a no smoking sign in plain view but it's a real smokers paradise and the association for tobacco free living's worst nightmare. Upon entering, I apparently misjudged the amount of smoke inside and quickly realized it once I left. I seriously smelled like I had just finished fighting a few fires.
