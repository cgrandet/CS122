They have successfully let me down each time I've gone there. I'm not the kind of person who is going to cause a big fuss. I'm going to give businesses a chance to help me out with what they supposedly \"do best\", and IF (after 3 tries) they still can't seem to get it right, I'm going to go elsewhere. I'm not really a die hard bike person. I ride a bike in the city but I am not the bike-riding hipster type who knows how to fix slightly complicated bike issues. I am completely willing to pay the professionals to do that for me. I was really hoping that these guys could be my go-to bike shop. But alas.... Visit #1: My breaks were squeaking to high heaven. I paid a fair chunk of change and they held onto the bike for about 4 hours. When I returned they told me everything was fixed and fine. *** I immediately biked down the block and discovered that the breaks sounded the same as they did when I went there originally. ***Visit:#2: I went in to ask them to fix my tire that continued to go flat (something about the air valve of the tube being pinched). It wasn't super pricey but I expected them to check out the actual wheel to find out how the problem kept occurring. 2 hours later I picked it up and rode it home.*** The following morning, I went to go unlock my bike from where I parked it the night before (immediately after I left their shop) and found that the tire was (once again) flat.***Visit #3: Got a new bike! Needed a new U-lock. Went in to buy the lock and needed to add the simple mount onto the frame. I told them that I was certain that I could just do it myself but if I needed help, I would ask. I proceeded to make it happen but the mount was requiring a bit more muscle than I could muster up. I asked for help. One of the guys began helping and then told me that the mount was as tight as it would go. I was certain that that wasn't the case because it was still appearing to be all loosey goosey. (I've had these locks before)So I continued to struggle with the damn mount. \u00a0The dude, meanwhile, proceeds to walk away and put price labels on random boxes and completely ignores the fact that he has not yet finished helping me accomplish this simple task. \u00a0I finally do everything myself and leave the store.....annoyed....per usual. I'm sorry, but I get that you're \u00a0pretentious hipster bike shop and you need to give off the \"I don't give a shit\" vibe.....but there needs to be an occasional customer service vibe every now and then. I also accept the fact that most of these services were things that (if I were a bike person) I would be able to fix myself....but.....bike places like this exist for a reason. So I feel like if I'm coming in and giving you money, you might consider helping a lady out and saving the sass for someone who is not a friendly customer. I will not be back to this place. I don't care that I live 2 blocks away. I will bus my bike over to Logan Square and let the dudes a Boulevard Bikes help me in the future. At least they'll charge me for repairs that they ACTUALLY take care of, while being a bit more friendly.That's that.", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 8, 4]}, "47": {"description": "Me and my bike, we're best pals.

I used to go to this shop a lot. Ive had 3 complete tune-ups done here, they converted my bike into a single speed here and Ive ordered a ton of parts from them. Ive given them a lot of business for 2 reasons.1. because they are a co-op. A neighborhood effort designed to make a positive impact on the business and bicycle community of Humboldt Park& 2. Because they were new and lacked the pretentiousness hipster attitude you get from a lot of shops in the Wicker/Bucktown/Near North Areas.They used to be very helpful. Very insightful and had a open workshop where for a small donation you could bring your bike in and work on it yourself and get inside tips from the people who work there.I used to rave about this place and tell everybody to go here. I swore by it.Well, that has now officially changed.I have been in there twice in the last 2 months and have gotten very little help and tons of attitude. Their prices have gone up considerably. And sometimes its really hard to even tell who works there, who works there but isnt working there at that time and who is just hanging out. And most recently a good friend of mine went there to bring in a bike and a stroller to get some flats repaired and his bike tuned up and told me this awful story about how because he knocked on the door a couple minutes before the shop opened on a saturday , and simply asked if he could bring his items in the shop and come back when they opened to discuss the repairs instead of having to wait outside (because he didnt have his lock with him).. was actually yelled at for knocking on the door and then got into a verbal altercation once the shop opened about how a shop has hours for a reason and they cant just open their doors because they are there working, and then the \"shop manager\" \u00a0told him that maybe he should take his business else where..Well.. With all the other shops around, and new ones popping up.. especially one very new unnamed shop that actually has 2 original members of West Town Bikes working there..

Hands down. So specifically, I have been in on a few occasions.

It makes me happy that this place is in the neighborhood, because the area is lacking in a bike shop, and especially one that doesn't have a pretentious attitude. Now for my review of the Working Bikes part of the shop: I needed to swap out a freewheel on my bike. This is a pretty simple thing to do mechanically, but you need a special tool. I took advantage of WTB's women and transgender open shop night. They had the tool I needed, along with all of the other stuff I needed for the job, including a vice and bike stands, which are things that I don't get to use often in my home-mechanic efforts. It was really great and the women instructors were really helpful and gave me some great tips on how to best do the project and also for how to get my chain tension right when putting the wheel back on. This was great because while a guy can put a wheel back on and get the chain tension right in a matter of minutes, sometimes us women have to do it a little differently, and it was great to learn some ways to make it easier.West Town is a welcome addition to the neighborhood!", "rating": "5", "date": [2009, 7, 2]}, "24": {"description": "One of the best bike shops in town.

They also said the woman who donated it was super cool and the bike had some awesome juu juu- \u00a0I absolutely LOVE it!! I also love the fact that I was able to support a great cause as they are a non-profit and all about bike education and community building. Another great thing was in 30 days they said to bring it in for a check-up to make sure everything is working well on the bike and then in 90 days to bring it in for a free tune-up, how awesome!!", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 3, 18]}, "45": {"description": "Now, keep in mind I have only been there once after hearing about them for freaking ever and being a hardcore SmartBikes fan.

They have successfully let me down each time I've gone there. I'm not the kind of person who is going to cause a big fuss. I'm going to give businesses a chance to help me out with what they supposedly \"do best\", and IF (after 3 tries) they still can't seem to get it right, I'm going to go elsewhere. I'm not really a die hard bike person. I ride a bike in the city but I am not the bike-riding hipster type who knows how to fix slightly complicated bike issues. I am completely willing to pay the professionals to do that for me. I was really hoping that these guys could be my go-to bike shop. But alas.... Visit #1: My breaks were squeaking to high heaven. I paid a fair chunk of change and they held onto the bike for about 4 hours. When I returned they told me everything was fixed and fine. *** I immediately biked down the block and discovered that the breaks sounded the same as they did when I went there originally. ***Visit:#2: I went in to ask them to fix my tire that continued to go flat (something about the air valve of the tube being pinched). It wasn't super pricey but I expected them to check out the actual wheel to find out how the problem kept occurring. 2 hours later I picked it up and rode it home.*** The following morning, I went to go unlock my bike from where I parked it the night before (immediately after I left their shop) and found that the tire was (once again) flat.***Visit #3: Got a new bike! Needed a new U-lock. Went in to buy the lock and needed to add the simple mount onto the frame. I told them that I was certain that I could just do it myself but if I needed help, I would ask. I proceeded to make it happen but the mount was requiring a bit more muscle than I could muster up. I asked for help. One of the guys began helping and then told me that the mount was as tight as it would go. I was certain that that wasn't the case because it was still appearing to be all loosey goosey. (I've had these locks before)So I continued to struggle with the damn mount. \u00a0The dude, meanwhile, proceeds to walk away and put price labels on random boxes and completely ignores the fact that he has not yet finished helping me accomplish this simple task. \u00a0I finally do everything myself and leave the store.....annoyed....per usual. I'm sorry, but I get that you're \u00a0pretentious hipster bike shop and you need to give off the \"I don't give a shit\" vibe.....but there needs to be an occasional customer service vibe every now and then. I also accept the fact that most of these services were things that (if I were a bike person) I would be able to fix myself....but.....bike places like this exist for a reason. So I feel like if I'm coming in and giving you money, you might consider helping a lady out and saving the sass for someone who is not a friendly customer. I will not be back to this place. I don't care that I live 2 blocks away. I will bus my bike over to Logan Square and let the dudes a Boulevard Bikes help me in the future.

The first prescription we brought their was for my wife's monthly hormone. The girl who took the prescription information suggested that we sign up for automatic monthly renewal whereby we would get a phone call to three days before the prescription was to run out & the prescription would be ready and waiting for us.Two days after running out and realizing she had run out I went to CVS to get the prescription & to find out what happened to the automatic renewal. Nobody had an answer at that time but the same thing happened the following month. This time I spoke with a different girl who said for whatever reason this particular prescription was not eligible for automatic refill that she had no idea why the other girl had me go through the trouble of getting all the information for automatic renewal.They were always a little slow in filling the prescriptions but they were close by so it wasn't an issue till a week ago. Please follow the timeline - Catherine leaves her doctor's office at Foster in California at 4:30 - the prescriptions had been sent to CVS - via the doctors who use A prescription writing machine in other words electroniclly & instantly transmitted to CVSShe stops at our shop - Windy City Parrot - to pick me up as it was now a little after five. We putzed around the shop until about six - providing ample time to get the prescription filled. It's six o'clock we walked in to CVS we are at the end of a line of eight other people waiting for the prescriptions. At 6:20 on face-to-face with a pharmacy technician who says the prescriptions aren't not ready and they can't even find them to fill. A man behind the counter are shuffles through a bunch papers and eventually locates the 4 prescriptions that have been electronically transmitted for convenience. I tell him I'll be back in an hour and we go home which is to 2 1/2 blocks away.I go back at 8:20 that evening and stand at the counter - two people working and I am being ignored - one girl was very busy filling up a drawer with empty pill bottles, she make three trips while the pharmacist on duty rearranges mechanical items on the counter in an OC kind of way. I finally yell \"hello I'd like to pick up my prescription\" - the girl comes over and asked me for my name - guess what prescriptions aren't ready yet. And she can only find three of the four now - I get the pharmacist who I now explain the timeline to and very rudely say \"I want my stinking medication & I want to go home you've had the prescriptions for three hours.\" I patiently wait for another 10 minutes and the drawer filling girl comes back and starts explaining the medications to me. She says insurers picked up the first three then gets to the fourth when an says \"you're insurance picked part of this but \u00a0it's still is pretty expensive.\" I say something to the effect of \"oh well what can you do, how much do I owe you I would like to go home\". She rings it up and it's much more than anticipated, I bring this to her attention say \"you just told me the insurers picked up three of the four.\" She says I did not, and now wants to argue with me - not a good plan for her because I am a master arguer and she was way out of her league.

The owner is incredibly friendly and came over to introduce herself during my visit, which added to the overall friendly neighborhood feeling of the salon. The stylists themselves looked put together, and appeared to truly enjoy their profession.When I got there, I sort of stood around a while since there doesn't seem to be an official receptionist to greet anyone, and the rest of the staff seemed busy. After a few moments, I was introduced to my stylist and quickly realized we'd be working through motions and gestures, since she spoke no English and I spoke no Spanish. A coworker translated for me, and we settled on my services and got started. I had wanted my highlights touched up, and they had suggested getting lowlights to freshen up my overall color, which I agreed was a great idea. I picked out the lowlight color from the color swatches myself. I have very thin, fine hair that is very quick and easy to do, so I figured I'd be in and out by lunchtime.I ended up spending *4 hours* in the chair - \u00a0my whole base color was dyed the darker \"lowlight\" color I had chosen, and then was highlighted over this base color. This meant bleaching out the color she just put in (pointless!) AND bleaching over my old bleached highlights - ouch! The end color result, while really pretty, was significantly darker than the color I walked in with - definitely *not* what I had wanted. I also ended up with a REALLY uneven haircut, and while she gave me an excellent blowout, she just did it without any indication it was an additional fee.I was absolutely exhausted by the time I left, not having had expected to spend 4 hours there. (It usually only takes 2 hours max, even when I do my base or lowlights!) While everyone was friendly and sent a smile in my direction, it was pretty tough sitting still for that long and not being able to have any conversation whatsoever with your stylist. The cost of the services was not at all what was expected because something was lost in translation (literally), which was frustrating, but overall was still within an acceptable range.So, would I go back? Probably not, but don't discourage others from trying them. I think my experience was a one-off, and not the norm. Their prices are reasonable, the staff was very sweet, and they use excellent color and product. I would like to get my nails done, since their nail techs seemed really talented.

As soon as I arrived, I was greeted with a big hug from the owner, Migdalia herself! She was genuinely sweet and welcoming. She set me up with Magali, who gave me a wash, cut and blow dry.

After she was done with me, my hair looked better than it ever has. Magali was so sweet and took very good care of me.

Being new to the area, I actually used his review as the reason to give it a try. Never again. I am of the belief that all Chinese restaurants should be graded on a single recipe. Its as level of a playing field as you can get with similar restaurants. Mine is General Tao/Tso Chicken. While some places make it with no veggies, some with broccoli, and some with green peppers, onions, and carrots, they all tend to follow the same basic sweet/spicy sauce over fried chicken base. So being that this was my first time, I order the General Tao chicken lunch special. I was intrigued because for $5.80 it was advertised that \u00a0I would get the chicken dish with shrimp fried rice, egg roll, crab ragoon, and a water or soda. In reality, I did not get any crab ragoon, the egg roll tasted as if it was freezer burned then cooked in month old oil (I couldn't finish it and that is extremely hard for me to do with any food), and I am not entirely sure if I actually got chicken or just fried spongy batter. There was no chicken texture inside the ,soggy, pancake-like batter and a few of the larger pieces I peeled apart only to question \"is this chicken?\". The rice was mediocre and highly oily with a handful of salad-sized shrimp, but the Dr. Pepper was as reliable as always.

Another lady walked in at the same exact moment and wanted to know about it too, as there was no label describing it, and it looked so yummy. After hearing the description, I asked if I could get a piece of it as well. I went to pay with a ten dollar bill and two pennies. The girl behind the counter seemed annoyed that I gave her two cents on the thirty seven cents and even said, \"that's not going to help.\" She seemed really annoyed that she had to wait on me and made me feel like she was doing me a favor by allowing me to patronize the business. The other lady who wanted the mousse cake was actually really cool and friendly. When I went to leave the store, I said thank you. The other customer acknowledged me and said you're welcome! (We had been chatting about Thai mango dessert, so maybe she thought I was thanking her for information.)The girl behind the counter said nothing for the whole transaction other than the quip regarding the pennies and did not respond with a \"you're welcome\" when I left the store.

I came here since it is a pretty well rated Ukrainian \u00a0cafe/pastry shop so I wanted my parents and I to relive the \"Ukrainian experience.\" We got here on a Sunday around 2pm and it was pretty packed but we were able to get a table right away. It's got a cute, simple, clean cafe vibe. I wouldn't exactly describe it as authentic eastern European by appearance. It took a little while to be approached by they only had like two servers for the whole place. Maybe they weren't expecting it to be super busy at that time, but it was. We started with the borsch, which is a traditional red beet Ukrainian soup. We got the large bowl for $5 and shared it and it was just okay. My mom's tastes a little better in my opinion but I did love the little bun buns that came with it. They were these little bread rolls that were quite tasty and were nice to dip in the soup. My parents got the Vareniki, which are like pierogi's stuffed with different things. We got the chicken as one order and the potato as another order. I definitely like the chicken ones more, but I wish they came with like a cup of chicken noodle broth, just like my grandma used to make. Both vareniki came with sour cream and Korean carrots which were pickled. The potato vareniki were good but they weren't excellent, they need a lot more fried onion to really bring out the flavor but that's okay, we devoured them anyway. We also got this beef and potato dish served in clay pot with lima beans along with those bread bun buns again. And again, the bun buns were the best part. The dish lacked a little flavor for me, as it was more garlicy than anything else and I'm not a fan of too much garlic. By that point we were too full for dessert and they honestly didn't look too appetizing to me. Overall, the food was just okay, nothing special, the prices were decent and the service was just eh because the poor girls were running around like crazy trying to accommodate everyone.

A European cafe, in the sense that you can order anything--from coffee to a snack to a full meal--in nicely decorated surroundings, and feel comfortable and well-taken care of. Having a place like this in every neighborhood, if not on every corner, is what we lost because of Starbuck$. With Starbuck$ replacing local cafes In Europe, it's easy to understand why many hate U.S. food franchises over there.But I digress. Here the borscht (they call it borsch) is a tasty beet soup with a chicken stock base, served warm. Although some call it sweet, the only sweetness comes from the beets. In my opinion this borscht is right in the middle, between the ones with added sugar that are cloying and the ones that are tart. Here there is a nice mix of shredded cabbage and diced beets in the soup; often you get one or the other. Served with delicious brioche rolls. Then came sweet cheese crepes, which were the same as blintzes except they were folded into triangles instead of rounds. The crepes were incredibly fresh tasting and delicious, and the sweet cheese filling was rich, for a perfect combination. Topped with powdered sugar and served with berry compote and whipped cream, this dish could not be better.Perhaps you never experienced the homemade creations of an East European grandmother.

This cut of steak is known as \"palomilla\" in Spanish, and is used in preparing Cuban, Puerto Rican and Colombian cuisine.

Antonia who handled my order was super nice and just great to work with. I also purchased from the grab and go area an alcapurria and it was by far in my opinion one of the best I've tried.

The arroz con gandules was so flavorful and \u00a0soft without having an over powering taste. It was the perfect accompaniment to the chicarrones. The Bistec guisado was a stewed beef, stewed so long that the meat was fork tender and sweet. LOVED IT! I also tried the plantain ball with meat inside and that was TO DIE FOR!

I had been craving some home food ever since it started snowing but the other Puerto Rican places I had tried just weren't that good (or cheap). This is by far the most authentic Puerto Rican restaurant I have been to in Chicago. I had the chicken breast sauteed in butter and garlic (and onions -yum) because they were out of lech\u00f3n. I ordered a side of mofongo (mashed green plantains with pork rinds and garlic) and the dish came with a salad (iceberg lettuce and a slice of tomato) and caldo de pollo (chicken broth with potatoes, which is commonly eaten as a side for the mofongo). Since I was pretty upset about not being able to eat lech\u00f3n and was debating wether to order a side of rice or not- the waitress threw in a small arroz con gandules order for me. Yay!! The portions were very generous, I was full halfway through my plate but ate it all 'cause I don't get to eat such an amazing meal everyday now. My boyfriend ordered the jibarito (which is a Chicago Rican dish and not a thing we eat at home) and it was so delicious we should be making it in the island! My friend ordered the chicharrones de pollo (crispy fried chicken) which were made with chicken breast and they were one of the best things I tried on my visit. The seasoning for all the food was on point. The mofongo perfectly mashed and assembled, it was heavenly. The arroz con gandules tasted just like the one at the lechoneras back home! The meats were not too salty (like in other Caribbean restaurants) but not bland (like in most general restaurants here). The waitress was super nice and fun. The owner of the restaurant went by our table and talked to us. And everyone else in the place was nice and happy. There were people dancing salsa and playing drums in a corner of the restaurant which made us feel just as if we were back home. The prices are super adequate considering the amount of food (enough to take some home or to share with someone) ranging from 7-10 per plate. I am incredibly happy that this place exists.

She just pointed at the case, all filled with pastries that looked exactly the same and told me that was all she had left. She then left the restaurant and I had to wait for another couple of minutes until she came back. When she came back, I asked her what the flavors of the pastries were and she said one kind was just guava, one was just cream cheese and one was apple. Was that that hard? I thought it was so rude, especially since I had gone in, being so excited to try the pastries. Now, the pastries lived up to their name. The guava pastry was flaky and delicious, and I had an apple turnover that was divine as well.

From the rice to the tostones, I'm a raging fan. It's a nice location in the Humboldt Park hood and easy to find. You can smell the rotisserie chicken from their parking lot across the street. You better beware though, it smells that fantastic from the immense amount of garlic each is slathered with. If you're not careful, it can stay with you for the rest of the day. I always make a point of having a fizzy drink with my dinner; I'm convinced it helps. Most of the time it's my Caribbean favorites Kola Champagne or Coco Rico. They also offer ginger ale, root beer, Pepsi, and parcha (AKA passion fruit). There are daily dinner specials but my favorite day at Papa's is Saturday. The one day a week lechon is awesome. It's easy to find this over salty, greasy, or dry in other places, but Papa knows pork. It's perfectly seasoned on its own, however Mama has a kick in the mouth green hot sauce that pairs wonderfully with the roast pig. The tostones are reliably good. Some other places don't change their oil enough or they half cook the plantain in advance. Papa seems to clean the fryer regularly and make the delicious twice fried platanos to order. Garlic makes a not so subtle appearance on these babies too! Before I rave any more, I have to remind you that this is a mom and pop operation. They can easily run out of specials before they close. Sometimes that means you'll have a wait before you get your paws on the next batch of pollo chon. Sometimes that means you'll go without the lechon next Saturday. You can't rush the process. Speaking of rush, I don't think I've been here when the place wasn't full. So be smart or be patient! It's easier getting a table during the summer since the outdoor enclosed patio doubles the seating.

Can't eat due to medical condition and believe me, being Puerto Rican and not being able to eat pork or red meat was initially difficult.

Preggo problems), I have finally shaken the desire for that crap and am back to desiring hot, home cooked food. While coming from the north side of the city, I was not looking forward to rattling through pots and pans to cook, while my begging dog claws at my ankles at 10 something at night. I sighed as I continued driving down Division Street. The options around in either direction didn't appeal to me at all - Burger King, McDonald's..... BARF!!!! As I passed under the big Puerto Rican flag, I immediately thought about how I stopped at about 3 PR food trucks through Humboldt Park a few days ago (don't judge me) and how good a jibarito would be. I then passed Papas. It was a sign from the plantain gods!!!!I pulled a uturn and stopped. It's a very small place that you would totally miss if you weren't looking for it. There's plenty of street parking though. The inside is pretty small but that does nothing to take away from the PR feel of the place as you smell the aromas of the island and gaze at all of the celebrity pics on the wall. I ordered my chicken jibarito and rice and beans. The place was packed and normally is, but that doesn't take away from their service.The taste - delicious! Plantains were perfectly cut for the sandwich. I hate when thick pieces are cut. It was fried to perfection and the garlic, olive oil, and seasoning blends were mouth watering.

The waitress was on point in taking our orders even taught us something new of the difference between white and yellow cheese (which was shocking to learn the white cheese was american cheese and not yellow.. weird).What i order was the Jibarito con arroz (chicken cause i saw them roasting). First time ever trying it seemed like a a sandwich essentially. The patties used were flatten platens which gave it a very crispy taste and added texture to every bite and since the chicken was roasted to cook it was still juicy and like the meat ripped apart with each bite with such ease.FINAL VERDICT!!!!this spot is the place to go for Jibarito con arroz i really loved it if u haven't noticed what i rated it already.

Ahaaw, so I actually heard the song, \"Vivir Mi Vida\" by Marc Anthony playing here. It took me away to a tropical oasis vibe, and I wanted to do a few salsa steps. Hey, I'm sure I would have gotten the glare-down \"WTF are you doin' look!\" There is a definite Barrio vibe here. Everyone, from Abuelas to Ni\u00f1os comes for the knockout kick-ass authentic Puerto Rican comida featuring several dishes dashingly presented, and others simply massive: Mofongo al pilon de bistec (savory shredded beef over mashed green plantains) and pernil con arroz y gandules (roasted pork shoulder with pigeon peas and rice) are big enough to split. We love that this place is BYOW (bring your own whatever), and has a reasonable price-point. Over the years, we have been here over 12 times. I was shocked that I had not written a review for one of my favorite Puerto Rican restaurants (or if I want to change it up and get my freak-on with other PR joints I hit up La Plena or Juanita's). Papa's Cache has been my jam for the last several years. It's definitely a juicy gastronomic paradise if you are into this type of food. Papa's hace que mi vida valga (Papa's makes my life worth living)! \u00a0;DIf you enjoy Tostones (fried plantains that are NOT sweet) then try the Jibarito de bistec. The Jibarito contains generous flavorful tender steak meat and the tostones serve as the bread that holds it all together. These tostones have a crispy exterior and tender interior. Although deep-fried they are not greasy. The Jibarito (pronounced \"He-Bah-Ree-Tow\") is a Puerto Rican sandwich that is very popular here. Is it healthy? Hell no! It is loaded with tons of fat and calories. There is nothing healthy about a HE-BAH-REE-TOW!!! \u00a0If you eat these everyday you may end up with clogged arteries or high cholesterol for that matter. Hey, if you consider fried food healthy you better look up the fooken definition. The tostones are deep fried, but once in a great while I crave this type of food. Come to Papa's -- he satisfies me every single damn time! Papa's will satisfy you too (hey, I'm talkin' 'bout food here, not sex)!BTW, their house made aj\u00ed is delectable, aromatic and a must-try. The flavor is spicy, unusual and complex, with overtones of black pepper and coriander kicking up the food flavor by several notches. I like their coffee -- it is robust but not bitter yet strong -- and reminds me of a strong Espresso (not \"EXpresso\"). Some guy on Yelp Talk got bent out of shape, because some people spell it \"Expresso\" and not \"Espresso.\" You say \"Tomato\" and I say \"Tomata\" ....Hey, who gives a flying fook...but I digress....oh yeah, back to the food. It is perfecto, sabroso y por la maceta! I see that we have a couple of \"Debbie Downer\" reviews here from people who have less than 10-reviews. Get over yourselves, and go have a can of beer! If you call in your order at 11 am and receive your comida at 1:15 pm, well this is about right, because Spanish people (and yeah, I am half-Latina) operate on a different time zone. If you calculate that time to West coast time (not Central time), then you received your comida on time! ;DMy sister is married to a Puerto Rican guy. They met while in Graduate School, and his Mother, who is deceased, used to make the best Puerto Rican food I have ever, ever had. Every time I have eaten here it brings back memories of her delicious Puerto Rican comida. Damn, I miss her cooking! The service is non-effusive, so it receives 4-stars. This is not a fancy joint. It is a down-to-earth restaurant with friendly service and wonderful philoxenia. Also, parking is not difficult in this area of the city. This is a super small joint, so if you plan to have dinner here, go early especially on a Friday or Saturday.

It took me until I was a couple bites from finishing when I realized that I didn't get the hot peppers -- only the sweet. I was slightly miffed, but the beef was so good, I hardly gave a care at all. I will say that the spicy peppers on my Italian beef would have taken me to a high I haven't been to before in my life with food... and I'm scared of heights. Maybe it's a good thing they forgot the spicy ones. The fries were hothothot out of the fryer.

Unfortunately it does NOT unseat Mr. Beef on Harlem as the best beef I've ever had. While the flavors were very good a few subtle shortfalls spelled its doom for top spot. There were some nice peaks of oregano but it didn't explode in my mouth like Mr. Beef. \u00a0Also the beefs here are kind of small and not as much beef jammed inside, it seemed like i just took 3 bites and it was gone. Oh BTW, what's up with those fries (controlled portion)? Are they not the most boring fries ever? \u00a0Mr. Beef's fries are better and more plentiful.Overall a very good beef and the type of place a beef joint should be in.

However, I left thinking, I'm glad I tried it but it was nothing special or amazing. I read that it gets super busy so I decided to check it out on Sunday afternoon for an early dinner right when they open at 4:30pm. Well that was genius since no one was there and we got to pick any table we wanted. They have one table right by the open doors which is nice when the weather is great to catch some Chicago breezes. I mean you know it's about to get hot in your mouth so you need some extra air, right? Right. So upon arrival, the place is very nice decorated with little pillows, funky chandeliers, definitely liked the vibe. The service was good the entire time as everything was brought out fast and served hot just like we like it.Here is what we got that some people recommended with our friends to share: Gobi Manchurian -Cauliflower florets golden fried, saut'eed with chopped garlic, ginger, spring onions, with a hint of soy sauce. Super yummy, my hubby hates cauliflower and loved this dish so it's a must get and get it medium spicy.Keema Samosa (2pc) Crisp, deep fried turnovers stuffed with mild minced lamb and peas. These were a little dry in my opinion and couldn't really taste the lamb nor the flavor of it.Chicken Tikka Masala- Marinated white meat chicken cooked in tomato based sauce with herbs and spices. Something we get at every Indian restaurant and it did not disappoint. Loved dipping all their fresh naan into it. Oh, and get the butter naan, you'll thank me later.Vegetable Biryani-Basmati rice and vegetables cooked in aromatic spices; served with raita. Okay, so I didn't love this version as I've had others I liked before. Plus, our curries came with rice already so I wasn't sure why a server didn't let us know before we ordered this as well. Lamb Rogan Josh-Boneless lamb cooked with mild dry red chilies with a hint of yogurt. Our server told me to get this dish and he said it's a little spicy. A little spicy?! OMG, it was on fire. I can't tell you my thoughts on this dish since it was basically fire in my mouth and I couldn't taste anything else.Overall, some classics like tikka masala were awesome, loved the gobi manchurian and of course all their naan, but other dishes were all so eh.

However, since I cannot, this place get a 3. I didn't want to do 2 stars, but the service was so horrific that I wish I could give them a 1 star. If this peaks your curiosity, read on.A group of us came for a 7:30pm reservation. By the time everyone showed up it was closed to 7:45-7:50. We were seated in the front, in 2 tables. There were 7 of us total, but they only gave us 3 chairs. if you have been here before, you know that each table is essentially good for 1 person on each side. We were forced to have 4 people on one side, which was very, very, very annoying, as there was so much food on the 2 tables that eating was a sport - make sure you don't spill on yourself, make sure your arm doesn't hit the other person next to you, make sure your smallest movements don't cause a domino effect of things falling on the table. It wasn't thought out well. I asked for another chair, so we could at least have 3 people on the side, and rudely I was told they had no chairs and that we would need to have all 4 on one side. Who does that? How do you not have enough chairs? We ordered a ton of food. A ton. The food was fantastic. I would come back here for the food anytime. However, the service was shotty. We ordered naan, and it came last, after all the food, and we had to ask again to make sure they were bringing it. After they brought it, we asked for the sauces, which should have already been given to us. Nope. We had to ask. And they were not the most polite about it. We had to continually ask for these sauces, as there were 7 of us, and they gave us 1 small dish. We also had to keep asking for water.Normally, these things would not bother me as much if the last thing didn't happen. But it did, so now this place is tainted in my mind.We finished eating and since it's a BYOB, we were still finishing our wine bottles that were open (3). We were asked by 2 separate waiters that we needed to go, because they needed our table. I have never, ever, been asked to leave an establishment when we are still not done with our drinks/food. I could understand if the entire place was packed, people were waiting in line outside or in the front, or if we were there for 3 hours and still not leaving. But we weren't even there 1.5 hours and were being forced to leave. We had full wine glasses full of wine, and we had just had the table cleared! It was appalling. You NEVER tell your guests they have to leave when your establishment offers BYOB, forcing them to essentially leave what they have behind.We ended up chugging our wine because we got asked again to leave. All of us were in shock that they had the nerve to ask us again to leave. We were respectful the entire time, but it seemed the politeness only was one sided. It's a shame, really. Because terrible service is a big factor in choosing where you want to spend your money. There are plenty of restaurants in chicago to choose from. Even though the food was great, the service is what got me. It won't be the first place I'll suggest for indian from here on out, so if you don't care about being treated like you don't matter, then go to this place.

Who does that? How do you not have enough chairs? We ordered a ton of food. A ton. The food was fantastic. I would come back here for the food anytime. However, the service was shotty. We ordered naan, and it came last, after all the food, and we had to ask again to make sure they were bringing it. After they brought it, we asked for the sauces, which should have already been given to us. Nope. We had to ask. And they were not the most polite about it. We had to continually ask for these sauces, as there were 7 of us, and they gave us 1 small dish. We also had to keep asking for water.Normally, these things would not bother me as much if the last thing didn't happen. But it did, so now this place is tainted in my mind.We finished eating and since it's a BYOB, we were still finishing our wine bottles that were open (3). We were asked by 2 separate waiters that we needed to go, because they needed our table. I have never, ever, been asked to leave an establishment when we are still not done with our drinks/food. I could understand if the entire place was packed, people were waiting in line outside or in the front, or if we were there for 3 hours and still not leaving. But we weren't even there 1.5 hours and were being forced to leave. We had full wine glasses full of wine, and we had just had the table cleared! It was appalling. You NEVER tell your guests they have to leave when your establishment offers BYOB, forcing them to essentially leave what they have behind.We ended up chugging our wine because we got asked again to leave. All of us were in shock that they had the nerve to ask us again to leave. We were respectful the entire time, but it seemed the politeness only was one sided. It's a shame, really. Because terrible service is a big factor in choosing where you want to spend your money. There are plenty of restaurants in chicago to choose from. Even though the food was great, the service is what got me. It won't be the first place I'll suggest for indian from here on out, so if you don't care about being treated like you don't matter, then go to this place.

My mouth is watering just thinking about their food again; I hadn't had Indian food that good in a very long time! I tried the onion bhajee and chicken tikka for starters. The chicken came sizzling and covered with fresh veggies, and was divine - a must try if you're dining here. The bhajee was my least favorite dish of the night, but don't get me wrong, it was still really good - very crispy and wonderfully spiced. It's just that compared to the rest of the excellent meal it was probably the dish I could do without. For entrees, we had the chicken vindaloo and the bhindi masala (an okra dish). We were warned that the vindaloo was very spicy, but I actually thought the bhindi was way spicier and there was little heat in the vindaloo in comparison. Both dishes were delicious, but do be wary about the spice in dishes that aren't marked as hot on the menu. We also got the garlic naan, which came fresh out of the oven and was smothered in fresh chopped garlic. It was delicious and paired perfectly when dipped into the vindaloo/masala. The portions in pictures may look deceivingly small, but we ended up having to take half our food home because there was so much. We each paid ~$25 which I thought was extremely reasonable given both the quality and quantity of food.The server was very attentive, and made sure we always had water. He overheard me mention to my friend that we didn't have knives, and he came over with a couple right away. The host was cold and scowl-y which I normally wouldn't give a crap about when the food is this good, but he was much friendlier to another party which was really off putting (and the reason I can't give 5 stars).

He had me sit up and told me the piercing would look a little crooked until I was able to change rings because the retainer I chose was wider than my septum. I was bummed but trusted what he said to be true. He laid me down once more, took the retainer out, and using the same entrance pierced my septum again! He said he wanted to fix the angle. I appreciated that he wanted to make sure it was pierced correctly, no complaint there. After going through the pain of having my septum pierced again, I looked in the mirror. The retainer was still crooked but I believed what Cuba said about the retainer being wider than my septum, and once it was healed I could switch to a smaller retainer and it would be straight. After a few days I took a better look at the piercing and it was very apparent that it was pierced completely crooked!! The left side was pierced signaficianlty higher than the right side. Unfortunately I was out of town when I made this discovery and would not be back for another 2 weeks. Tired of looking at my stupid $80 mistake ($60 plus a $20 tip!!!!!), I took the retainer out.

On my way home from Identity, I passed Infamous Ink, so I stopped in there. They were completely empty. Two guys stood there staring. They didn't greet me or ask what I needed. I asked what they charge to put in jewelry that I brought. They quoted me a price -- and then began backtracking on it!! Nothing is more aggravating to me than that. If you're that worried I won't tip, then I'll save everyone the favor and not give you my business in the first place. At Identity, they actually acknowledge you when you arrive and offer you tea and candy (admittedly, I was insanely jazzed up for more candy when I went back tonight, which only adds to my disappointment that they were closed). They sterlized the tools while I ate all their candy. They took my jewelry out and were very, very nice about it -- constantly making sure that they weren't tugging too hard, etc. I enjoyed the atmosphere there.They charged the price that they said they'd charge, and I tipped more than 200%. When I stormed out of Infamous Ink tonight, I straight up told the guy I was going to Identity (even though I knew they were closed early already) because of their prices and cited the specific amount. He was stunned at how little they charge. I went to school at IU and Bloomington is where I've had most of my piercings done (or redone...), and the piercers there don't charge anything to change/remove/put in jewelry. I get that this is Chicago and everything is expensive, though. However, it never ceases to amaze me that these tattoo/piercing parlors that all within five seconds of each other aren't more aware of each others' prices. To credentialize myself a little more on the matter of piercers all within five seconds of each other, I also had a lot of piercings done at the Silver Room on multiple occassions when I was in high school.

I also did not feel that the piercer was friendly or had a good manner- but maybe he was just hung over or having a bad day or something. When the piercer took out the jewelry I was previously wearing, he bent it irrepairably, not even asking if I had wanted to keep it for use later- this really upset me as the jewelry was my property and he basically ruined it, since I don't have the tools to fix bent jewelry. I felt that for such an expensive piercing experience, the service should be absolutely top notch. I don't want to tear down their reputation because most people clearly love this place, and I think they have a lot going for them in terms of the location and the property but I was just upset by the service that I got and walked away with such a bad taste, after I was preparing for a really good experience.

And thankfully for my boyfriend and I, they had something to suit both of our tastes - a burger for me (yes!...I sound like my sister) and a half hunk of chicken for him. We started out with a few small bites - the cod fritter, deviled egg stuffed into a pepper, and the pork belly bite. The cod fritter and the deviled egg stuffed pepper were really great - both of us agreed that they were our favorites. The pork belly was unfortunately whatevs, it was a bit lacking in flavor and tenderness, but the bites were a fun concept.Now on to that burger I was craving so badly - it was delicious!!! A double patty gluttonous cheeseburger that was so perfect. It came with a ton of fries that my boyfriend and I devoured, but sadly they came out cold. The half chicken that my boyfriend ordered was delicious - super moist, flavorful, and definitely filling. There were roasted garlic cloves all around the plate that were delicious - don't be afraid of them or the garlic breath that you assume that you'll have after the fact. It must be magic, but my garlic hummus gives me more garlic breath than biting into those tender cloves.Overall, I really liked Haywood Tavern.

It may be my personal taste, but my drink had strong cinnamon overtones, making it feel like I was sipping on Fireball Whiskey.For food, we ordered the burger, steak frites, and smashed potatoes. The burger was pretty delicious. The patties were well seasoned and the sauce was mouth watering. I think the steak frites had the potential to be good with the accompanying Bleu cheese butter, but the steak was cold. It felt like they let it sit for a while before serving. It kind of took away from the experience. The fries on both the steak and the burger were overdone. At least the garlic aoili was delicious and had an addicting quality.

I love steamed beef and Paisano does these quite well! The flautas were good (although my GF likes them soaked in oil \"for your health\" as she puts it) and she really liked the guacamole and was happy with her flautas. She also showed me her rice and said \"is that normal\"? Yes, the arroz had a tiny sprinkling of green peas, little carrots, and little potatoes in it. The ground beef in the flautas had some potatoes mixed in. This is is a common way to make rice or ground beef, but I have only been to 2-3 taquerias where they do this. Every region in Mexico and the Southwestern USA has its own style and some of the cooks around here must be from a place where tossing those things in is considered cool. Hybridity is the name of the game in the Mexican kitchen and I thought the little peas tasted great! Big plus around here: Open at 9 am! If you are not familiar with Mexican food - try breakfast wherever you can. I am happy to see a taqueria open for breakfast. The breakfasts are $4.99 and the Chilaquiles Juevos and steak plate is only $6.99. In a part of Chicago where the brunch munch crowd rules the streets on Saturday and Sunday and places on Division, or the trendy Humboldt Park places make you wait an hour and charge $25 for a half slice of toast and an a-la-carte menu I am happy that I can stroll in here, get a cup of coffee and eat an amazing plate of Juevos a la Mexicana for just a few bucks more than McDonalds!

So, I begin....One warm summer day on Division street, my stomach began to growl (insert- sound: grrrrrrr). I immediately decided that Mexican food would cure the beast that is my belly! Walked into Paisano's, met the friendly manager/owner. Got my delicious order and left. Since that time, El Paisano and I, like many new relationships, tested the waters. At one point I placed an order, I believed they gave me the incorrect order, called up the joynt, spoke to the owner and was rudely treated. Baffled, obviously because we had just begun our new \"taco-eating\" relationship. The owner mentioned that I must have been mistaken and that I would have to walk ALLLLL the way back to the restaurant to exchange it. Now see, I was on a lunch break. So in my mind, not only would I not be able to eat my order, but I'd also have to exchange it....that didn't fly. After some pouting, the owner reluctantly agreed to have someone deliver my new order, but under one condition RETURN THE WRONG ORDER. How rude! Were they going to serve it to someone else? Did he think I was a big, fat, taco-eating-liar? Anyway, Round three....My job, for a company party orders El Paisano tacos because of the first rave views I gave my fellow co-workers. However, their bulk order of tacos consisted of horrible tacos shells. They were cheap and not really corn tortillas. The ingredients were shotty.

Everyone raves for the al pastor, and yes, it's pretty good; but I personally enjoy the asada. Order your tacos with grilled onions, lovely way to have them. The taste and cozy confines really take me back to the tacos one would find walking down the streets of a Mexican city (could it be someplace maybe in Jalisco, hmmm? curiouser and curiouser. . . ), people behind the counter always have a smile on their faces (at least the times I've been there).Guess my only complaint is that since it's at a weird little intersection, parking is a little interesting. I gave four stars because, I don't know, I just don't feel like giving five. The aforementioned tight spaces, and all that, I guess.

I went to 3-4 taco places to determine which place is the best around Chicago. I found this place on Chicago's Best so I gave this place a try. I had the steak tacos and the tacos al pastor. The steak is juicy and seasoned well. The pastor is also juicy, but falls short behind that from my number one taco joint. The taste is close to par with that from my number one taco joint; however, the texture here is homogeneously consistent (like pulled pork). There are no crispy chunks of deliciousness.A highlight from here is the amount of meat on their taco. The meat-to-tortilla size ratio is great. Lots of deliciousness per taco. The ratio is higher than that from my number one taco joint; however, there is not enough \"points\" to make this place number one.A downside to this place is the size and location of the place. When I arrived here with a friend, we were laughing really hard at the size of the place. My friend was question where I have taken him, but his mind changed quickly after tasting the tacos. This place isn't great for groups more than 4, unless you start moving tables around (If I remember correctly, there were only 4 tables.). The location of the place looks \"shady.\" I sat with my back facing the entrance door. I get the feeling that I should keep my eyes behind my back.

I haven't reviewed this place yet!?!??! Shame on me!!I've been shopping at this Cermak Produce for YEARS. Mind you, I only lived close by for about a year, but I keep coming back, even if it involved a long trek across the city. Why? Because they're awesome. It's very nice inside, especially after their somewhat recent renovation. They have cheap produce (eg, limes 10 for $1, bunches of fresh spinach, romaine, and other salad greens for less than $1 each, all sorts of cheap squash, even some more exotic Hispanic fare like nopal and jicama). Their meat and deli counters are great, very quick even on busy days (some folks behind the counter don't speak perfect English, but they still make a great effort to help you). I got some Boar's Head turkey on sale for $6/lb, over $2 cheaper than the price I saw at another store. The best part: THEY DELVER!! Yup, if you buy over a certain amount in groceries (I want to say it's around $50 or $60, give or take- ask them for the exact amount), they will drop both you and your food off if needed. My friend and I went shopping during a snowstorm that soon turned in a blizzard and the delivery van dropped us off (note: we were going dang near Oak Park!). I don't often buy that much stuff from here and it's pretty hard to rack up that much shopping here b/c the prices are pretty low, but it's a great point to keep in mind in case we need to pick up party stuff.Some minor gripes: some stuff, particularly pet food, is pricey; not enough vegetarian options, though this is getting better now that they've stocked tofu; the veggies are good but the fruits were lacking this winter (yes, I know this was the Winter From Hell, but come on, even Aldi's had Cuties).

If you are looking for a place to grab all the fixings for the next cookout, or find some unique re-fried or canned beans (they have many different kinds, featuring different recipes), then you have come to the right place. This place is a typical Mexican fruit, veggie, and meat market, and caters to those who want to get all the fixings for salsa, as well as those looking to pick up staples in a part of the city that needs more groceries. I am a vegetarian, but for the meat eater in your posse this place has everything you need. Want good fajita meat? They have it in piles. My father Guadalupe always suggests you ask for it tenderized. They just toss it in a machine and the skirt stake is ready to soak in beer with a little salt and lime juice (Asada here we come!) The vegetable market is very Latin (Mexican and Puerto Rican) so don't expect whole foods layouts, but you can get all the fresh cilantro (they even had mint), tomatillos, and a nice selection of fresh hot peppers. The tomatoes were ok (not great). This place also does alright as a go-to grocery store since they have at least general coverage in most other areas. My mom loves Camay soap and they have this once quite common US brand in stock (imported from Mexico), like Mexican \"Coke-a-Cola\" from Mexico. Isn't it funny that you have to get US \"originals\" imported from Mexico? Well, they have both Camay and Coke, and toilet paper. This place is very Chicago. You have to love a Latino style market named after Anton Cermak, the Czech immigrant mayor of Chicago with roots in Pilsen (I think) who figured out how to appeal to and welcome the great diversity of immigrants in Chicago (he also made sure they were voters) before he was assassinated in 1933, but for more on Mr. Cermak, check out another website. I just think it is cool that history, food, music, and culture all come together at Cermak Produce and also that they accept credit and debit cards!

The pizza has a generous amount of toppings spread throughout with all the sausage, pepperoni, Italian beef, etc. The burrito was big and was tailored to perfection, it's one of those burritos you KNOW is good. So why only three stars after all these compliments? Well quite frankly presentation is not everything and the almost 2 hour wait did not help.The pizza was pretty bland for how many ingredients went into it. Pretty much the Italian beef took over everything except the bread which somehow had more flavor than everything else (and not that good of a flavor btw.) The sauce was scarce and flavor seemed non-existent, if you're going to make good pizza start with a good sauce which wasn't the case here. The ground beef in the burrito was super salty which was a major letdown. Other than that the burrito was probably the greasiest burrito I've ever handled, but somehow stayed together and would've been much better if those 2 flaws were fixed. I would give Guerrero's 3.5 stars had the issues I had with the burrito been fixed and delivery was faster, 4 if they used better quality ingredients to avoid that blandness that came with all their food.

I ordered two orders of \"Tasty Egg-rolls\" and the BBQ'd Pork...also a personal favorite. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So...I'm standing at the counter watching a cook dip his bare hand into a large bowl of raw chicken (no gloves) and mix it with batter, and then squish out the pieces into the wok-fry set-up for tonight's Orange/General Tao/ Sweet&Sour chicken. \u00a0His pile of fry- cooked product was considerable. \u00a0When he received my order he turned to the island sink for the quicky-rinse, then the quick hand-wipe on the apron towel...then walk over to the walk-in cooler...& walk out with 6-egg-rolls in bare-hand and toss them into the deep-fryer. \u00a0I winced. \u00a0Then, he walked back to his chicken fry project and got another batch of batter-dipped chicken squeezed out into the wok-fry, displaying considerable cooking experience and lack of understanding about cross contamination, since there was no rinse between. \u00a0Once the batch was in, he deftly gave his hands another quick-rinse, and made another trip to the walk-in; this time emerging with a generous bare-handful of sliced pork, which was then tossed into the basket of the other basket of the deep-fryer. \u00a0This was done in an expert manner, so as to be able to return to his wok-batch of batter fried chicken without delay. \u00a0 \u00a0By the time he strained out the finished battered chicken, my egg rolls and BBQ'd Pork were deep-fried to perfection. \u00a0The pork was tossed into a bowl and slathered with characteristic Red Chinese BBQ; and the egg rolls were tossed into classic waxy paper bags. \u00a0The woman at the counter bagged up my order and handed it to me. \u00a0I politely and with deliberate emphasis told her \"Good Bye.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 So the next time you are enjoying your \"super-generous portion\" of Orange Chicken just rememfber my eye witness account of the bare hand in the raw meat and then squishing the batter covered bird through the fingers; \u00a0Oh, and the egg- rolls? \u00a0I had to look inside: they were filled greasy glass noodles with a few paper thin slices ....yum...T-a-s-t-y. \u00a0Though I am pretty sure the deep fryer temp would kill most bacteria, \u00a0I will probably \u00a0not be making a return visit any time soon.", "rating": "1", "date": [2016, 1, 7]}, "9": {"description": "Tasty China is fast, prompt, cheap, and abundant Chinese food. \u00a0I've been delivering from them for a long time and I've always gotten quick and courteous service from them. \u00a0For that Chinese food fix, they've been there when I've needed that the most!", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 5, 10]}, "23": {"description": "Wow.

Upon walking in Friday night, it was a bit empty, but that just meant I could roam around and gaze at their interior like I was at a museum without getting weird stares. THIS is my candy store. Wish I had taken pictures of their walls because they actually had little tabs mentioning the artist for each hanging. Naturally, I questioned the baristas about some new beans and they were very insightful and gave great recommendations that suited my tastes. I liked the fact they weren't trying to push any purchases, but were genuine in the recommendations. They told me Friday's are $2 off beans and psh, of course I'm buying a bag then!! You had me at first taste, you don't have to convince me otherwise.I read some reviews and regret not checking out their upstairs, I was too busy rummaging through their merchandise, like \"Look at this jar with their logo!\" as my friend proceeds to roll their eyes. Small thing that caught my eye was how tiny their main floor, bathroom sink was. I wouldn't suggest this for the claustrophobic, but that thing was cool! Sorry I don't take pictures in the bathroom.I grabbed a cortado and sank into my seat. How can something so small make such a big impact? The Unicorn Blood was velvety smooth with the perfect balance of milk. The worst part was sipping the drink knowing it was coming to an end soon. It was Friday night and wasn't planning on slamming down 5 cortados (wish I could though...).

However, if you prefer the taste of coffee, like me, go for the latte. The flavor of the beans really stands out as something special.

There was also seating upstairs, which I didn't even need to check out because I found seating right downstairs near the bar area. I ordered an 8 oz latte and a sea salt bagel with cream cheese. I was a little disappointed because there was a plastic knife, a Philadelphia cream cheese, and he didn't offer to toast it. I know I probably sound like the most spoiled, pickiest person on the planet, but I definitely have received that basic service at similar cafes. I was also a little disappointed by my 8 oz latte because it came in a paper cup. The barista had warned me before ordering that the largest size comes in a to-go cup, but I wish that he had informed me that the smallest size would also come in a paper cup. All of that aside, the coffee was delicious (for coffee--I'm not a big drinker) and also had the most adorable little latte heart! It was very Instagrammable (my favorite). The atmosphere at Star Lounge is great and very laid-back. I felt relaxed there and was also able to get down to business to get work done on my laptop. A lot of the people there seemed to be regulars and there was a lot of greeting each other. I loved that sense of community!

They carry doughnuts here - I believe the varieties are from Do-Rite downtown - and many other pastries and sandwiches. The Wi-Fi here is fast and the space for doing work is plenty. As a law student, I am always looking for good coffee shops with places to spread my casebooks out and a good cup of coffee to keep me motivated. Star Lounge even has a backyard for when it's warm out!While I have not had the chance to have anything beyond the pour over or latte, the drip I've had here is a little off-putting.

Dark Matter caught my eyes a few months ago because I began hearing stories that these guys were making coffee with green beans aged in used whiskey barrels. Yeah, seriously and beyond the fact that I love Bourbon and Scotch, the concept had me intrigued yet every time I tried to order the beans, they were sold out online.Overall:I was here Saturday morning around 9AM and it was a packed house. Too cold to sit outside but they have an awesome sitting area with benches and a mural out back. The bar itself is long and seats about 18 people with a few tables scattered around. I ordered an espresso, Chai Soy Latte and a pour-over of their Barrel Aged Eden Coffee. Layout was nice but the line for coffee took a while to get through. They also had some cold brew on draft presumably on Nitrogen and they offered tea as well. Sorry to any Dark Matter lovers, I probably won't return as you'll see from my notes below but maybe I'll give it a second chance next time I'm in Chicago and update this review.Espresso:I was fairly happy with it. It was dense but a bit too bitter for my liking. Nice crema but the espresso was served not very hot like I could have drank it immediately down the gullet which was surprising but also a bit troublesome. Not sure why it was so 'warm' instead of hot but still the taste was okay. 6/10Chai Tea Latte:This wasn't my drink so I only had a sip of it but it was very 'latte' like. Thick, lots of froth, lots of sweetness and the tea was masked by this. I liked it but didn't love it. 6/10Pour-Over, Bourbon Barrel Aged Eden:I discussed this bean with the barista making it. It turns out a year or two ago, the barrel aged coffee offering was 100% barrel aged and now they're blending virgin and barreled beans together to get a good taste. The barista said he was thankful that was the case now because he really loves this product compared to the 100% barrel aged they used to offer.My thoughts? Hmmm, it tasted like Irish coffee or basically straight up coffee with cream and Jameson whiskey added. It was thin, a murky brown color and after 8 sips over 10 minutes, I decided I couldn't finish the cup. 4/10...because I guess whiskey and coffee aren't for me. I went in expecting to buy a bag to take home and am glad I ordered a cup on-site first.Pastries:I split a chocolate Croissant with the GF and despite not being baked on-site, it was slightly warmed with a good flakiness and butter quality. 8/10 but probably a shame that this was the best thing they offered.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 11, 16]}, "22": {"description": "I love this place because of the laid back atmosphere.

There is always local art around as well as local goodies from independent \u00a0places. My favorite thing is being able to grab a fresh Nutella croissant that is from west town bakery here! I seriously had to wean myself off of them because they are addicting. Lastly, but importantly for coffee snobs, the coffee is a bit acidic.

I left Chicago 6 years ago and I currently live in South Florida. In 6 years, I have looked everywhere for a descent tasting taco that can rival the authentic Mexican flava (that's right, flava) of Chicago. I live in Sunrise, Florida which is west of Fort Lauderdale and I thought I had managed to finally find a taco/burrito joint in Homestead, Florida - about an hour and a half away.That's right, the best tasting taco/burrito's are over an hour away and guess what? My wife and I make the trek whenever we have a hankering for some authentic Mexican food. You heard right, I'll drive that far for food that good. So, for the last 3 years or so, this Mexican joint became my de facto burrito spot because it had that long lost flavor that I so long for, up until last weekend.You see, that's when my wife and I visited Chicago and I told her we have to stop by this Mexican restaurant because they have the best food ever. We had eaten breakfast earlier so she wasn't that hungry. We ordered a Burrito and a taco to go - the burrito was for later and we decided to split the taco. Walking back to the car my wife was unwrapping our foiled taco, she sat in the front while I secured my overstuffed burrito in our bag. I get to the front and notice she's already bit into the taco. I immediately recognized the expression on her face since I've seen it before, I won't go into the specifics of where or how I've seen it but Iet's just say that the last time I saw that face was during \"le petit mort.\"The next words out of her mouth, with her eyes closed where, \"fuck you, get your own.\" That's right, they were that damn good that I had to back up and get another one! We got out and ordered two more burritos and one extra taco. The extra two were now officially heading to Miami with us, as for the extra taco, it survived long enough to get us to downtown...so long little taco, you will be missed.That taco was so good that I didn't go to the bathroom for 3 days because I didn't want to get rid of it.If you don't eat a taco at Huentitan, a bunny will die. If you don't eat a torta there, a slow and cuddly labrador pup will be drowned, if you don't eat a burrito there, you're offically a communist.

Like the traditional taco, I order my burrito with onion, buckets of cilantro, and (sometimes) cheese, but that's it. Oh, and of course... TONS of limes to squeeze on each juicy, meaty bite. \u00a0Their horchata, which is one of my most favorite summertime beverages, is made fresh, not with a power mix (the telltale sign of a Gringo-targeted Mexican joint). It is a bit on the sweet side but you can always add more ice to water it down and bring it to a higher level of cool. Their service is efficient and friendly, too, if you speak a little Spanish. This place is really good for diners that like to take the mystery out of hole-in-the-wall dining spots by actually seeing what is being prepared. Their kitchen area is located right by the entrance (viewable from the sidewalk, actually) so you can easily confirm the dish is freshly made and who is actually making it. Piles of various grilled and sauteed meats mingle with tomatoes, onions, and other must-have Mexican accouterments. \u00a0The meat is piled so high sometimes that wonder if they are overpreparing the stuff. But just as you think that, you turn around to walk out and see a line of cops, neighbors, and Latinos snaking its way out the door and you think: nope, they got it all figured out.", "rating": "5", "date": [2009, 1, 4]}, "1": {"description": "I walked over to Taqueria (Birrias) Huentitan today and had a really good lunch. \u00a0Two Al Pastor, a Pork Tamale + drink; $7+tip.

The tofu and egg rolls were solid. The broccoli with garlic sauce was only a little broccoli with a bunch of onions and some unidentifiable veggies.

Okay enough with the nonsense. The first order was Crab Rangoons and Mongolian Beef (the new style apparently). Crab Rangoons were filled to the brim with whatever gets stuffed inside and cooked to perfection. Very tasty, albeit a bit salty. That was not the case the second time I ordered as those were excellent. The Mongolian Beef was a large portion, but didn't really have all that much flavor. Veggies were still crisp though and the beef was plentiful, so all in all nothing a bit of soy sauce couldn't cure. Second time around I decided to try the Beef Egg Foo Young as I sometimes like to stretch my Chinese food into many meals the following day, and this order definitely allowed me that pleasure. Four patties for the ridiculous price of around $7 is pretty solid, and they tasted pretty good. Nothing phenomenal...nothing life changing, but like I said, for the price you can't go wrong. The only problem was the little container of fluffed up rice which was almost used up with just two of the patties. Whatever happened to Chinese places packing those little white containers with rice until they nearly burst at the seams? This isn't the only place I've run across this problem so I guess times are tough and corners need to be cut.

I've had delicious sushi at countless restaurants, ranging from cheap and simple (such as Blue Fin or Gosu) to innovative and perfect (Hachi's, Indie Cafe). This place is pretty cheap, and all the more so with the use of one of their many coupons in circulation. Unfortunately, this isn't reason enough to visit the restaurant, which bugged me for all sorts of reasons. For one, there's apparently no AC. My boyfriend and I visited on an excessive heat warning day to find only fans to keep us from sweating into our hot lava scallops (tasty enough, I admit), and there was no mention of whether this was standard issue or not (therefore, I assume it is). The staff had strange timing, asking my boyfriend if he wanted to order before I'd arrived, then waiting 10 minutes to check in on us once I was seated with my bottle of sauvignon blanc rising steadily in temperature on the table before us. They were streaming music off Pandora, and it was an enjoyable mix of alt rock and indie, except that they were too cheap to buy a \u00a0membership and avoid loud and lengthy commercial breaks. It' $35 bucks a year, people! And well-worth it for some added ambiance, I assure you. Yes, the wall mural on the Southern wall is vibrantly-painted, but the lighting is too dim and dreary to put you at ease within the confines of this black box structure on the bleakish corner of Kedzie and North.

I live a quick bike ride away from here & wanted it to be good. We had one of the daily deals coupons to check it out. It's in the place that used to be Treat. Decorations in the inside are ok, but their patio is horrendous. With a little bit of imagination they could dress it up. It feels like you're in a parking lot. Treat was marginally better at making the patio more homey, so there's a lot of room for improvement.The real problem is the service. Went at 8 p.m. on a Friday night. It was a 1/2 full, so not massively busy. Our waiter took our drink orders - we asked if they had hot green tea - not exactly an exotic order in an Asian joint. Twenty-five minutes later we had to ask, what about our tea? He said, oh, I've been looking all over the place for it all this time & we don't have any. Really? You spent 25 minutes looking for tea?Food was ok. The miso soup was fine, the agadahi tofu was pretty good. We had the chef's platter sushi/sashimi and it was just ok. It was better than what you get at Katana across from Brand (had borderline sushi there before!) but one step up from what I could get at Jewel's sushi bar. Again, my real problem with the service. Never came by to check on us; I had to go into the restaurant because I couldn't flag down anyone to refill the soy sauce container. We tried get the bus girl to help us, but every time we talked to her she just stared at us. I'm sure it was a language barrier, but if that's the case, she shouldn't work the front of the house. We had to go in and get our check, then again had to go in to pay -- our waiter was busy texting on his cell phone (which probably explains the 25 minute wait for no tea).Granted it's hard to get sushi in Humboldt Park, so if you have a craving, delivery is probably better, but frankly I'm not going back there.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 7, 24]}, "29": {"description": "Very chill spot, great staff and incredibly delicious sushi. \u00a0I loved the BLT roll, very tasty.

Sunday, I bought a \"refurbished\" Vicks humidifier for $29.99 (I know, I know for that price I could've gotten it new one at Target/Walmart). Yesterday, Tuesday night I took it out of the box and the unit was filthy dirty. It looked like this particular unit had been returned and never made it to the refurbishing area of the manufacturer. So they sold me a dirty, used unit for the price of a new one. Because it was so filthy, I never tested it, but there was a return sticker on the box that said \"not working\", but the cashier assured me that all the units they sell have been refurbished. So here's the great part. Today, three days after purchase, I went to return it and they don't have a refund policy, they only offer credits. The CS rep offered me to speak to a manager for a possible exception. Apparently this manager thought that I had used the unit and brought it back dirty, therefore she rejected the refund and said I could only have a credit.Obviously, this store \u00a0cannot stand behind the merchandise they carry and also hire managers that treat customers poorly and protect their bottom line. She made it obvious that she thought I used it and brought it back after a few days, regardless of the fact that it had very old hard stains on it. Buyer be aware.....They sell a lot of stuff you would find at the dollar store, but they also sell a lot of electronics, mostly generic made in China stuff and some that are actually known brands. A lot of their electronics and appliances are refurbished so you would be taking a huge risk with zero protection and poor customer service. Not worth the risk in my opinion and I learned that the hard way.

So I decided to give China Station a try and used their online ordering system at approximately 8pm. They were scheduled to close at 9pm. Time passed and passed, and the food never arrived. Around 9, I called and called the restaurant with no answer. I checked my bank statement and no charge had gone through, so I figured that they somehow did not get or did not fulfill the order, and left it at that.A few days later I realized I had been charged for the food that we never received. My husband called and spoke to a manager who did a little investigating and found my order had been delivered to the wrong address, and since it was already paid for via debit card, the person who answered the door decided to just take my food. GREAT JOB, PERSON WHO TOOK MY FOOD. Anyway. The manager was amazingly understanding, said she was doing the charge-back, called when she had performed the charge-back, and then drove to my house to personally drop off the printed receipt of the charge-back. Talk about customer service!So, since then, we have ordered from China Station twice. The portions are MASSIVE (a large is very, very, very large, let me tell you). The pork fried rice is very soy-sauce heavy and some of the bbq pork is gristly, but its not bad at all. The chicken moo-shu is cabbage heavy (the way I like it, I am not very fond of mushrooms), and they will fulfill my husband's bizarre request of beef with broccoli with no broccoli or any vegetables extra extra extra spicy with hot chili sauce and hot mustard on the side.Workmanlike Chinese food, but better than every other place I have ordered from save for one other rather expensive place, with EXCELLENT customer service.", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 10, 12]}, "23": {"description": "I first ordered from China Station after they left a brochure in my mailbox 4 years ago.

Don't even order it, just make sure you order more than $20 worth of food (easy) and ask for it. I think you can order $10 and get some too.* Fried Tofu -- vegans, this is for you. Grab some of this and the Vegetable Tofu dish and you're good to go, or Vegetable Deright / Hunan Mixed Vegetables (spicy)* Carryout -- takes about 10 minutes no matter what you order. Seriously. Parking around there is kind of a bitch so I suggest the north side of North Ave and then run across the street.* Derivery ;) -- The dude is usually pretty quick, I live a few blocks away so I only do this when I'm feeling super lazy.

Lesser version of hogsault group and I LOVE all of their restaurants (maudes, Babette's, gilt bar, au cheval). Seems like this place tried real hard to become one of those places but failed. The service is not great either. As soon as we walked in, the hostess was full of attitude and not at all accommodating. She set us in a corner right next to the outside door. As it was a chilly night, as the door opened a gush of cold air would swoosh in on us. Not pleasant and I was also recovering from a cold. I asked the hostess if we could sit elsewhere and she immediately said \"NO and I will NOT have anything else available for a long time.\" Fine, we sat down squished in a corner, cold. 5 min later we see a few bar sits open, she tells us nothing. I get up and ask her if we could move. Begrudgingly, she moved us. As we finally sat down, it took forever for the waitress to get our order. Once taken, it took awhile for the food to come. And once it did, I was left wishing to be at one of the actual Hogsault restaurants. Similar food and concept, just not as great. We ordered:Lamb tartare - really salty but still the best of the night. Mussels and clams dish - literally 5 mussels and 5 clams all in an overpowering thyme broth served in a gigantic pot. Pretty bland and watered down even with the thyme. Pork Ragu - it was good but nothing special. Not something to come back to. Fries - boyfriend loved the fries. As for me, I couldn't figure out the weird metallic/iron aftertaste of the fries. I only ate a few, not for me. Chocolate tart - a chocolate tart you could get anywhere else. Good but nothing special either. The decor was also left wishing more. Cheap take on the Hogsault group restaurants.

Still thinking about this as I write this review. Hamachi crudo, lamb tartare and the chicken liver toast were all excellently executed. I love beef tartare in general, but I can get it in many places in Chicago, so Bar Marta stands out for being unique and offering lamb tartare instead. The mussels and clams were out of this world good because it has bone marrow in it. So the broth was extra cloudy, flavorful, and yet not rich. Admittedly and embarrassingly, I was drinking the broth straight out of my spoon from the cast iron casserole dish. For the latter part of the meal, we had the Cacio E Pepe, meatballs, and broccoli leaves. Really, really good. I enjoyed the desserts (banana rum cake and Eton Mess) very much because it wasn't overly sweet.It's rare to have every single dish stand out when you order several items, maybe 1-2 items will stand out and the rest are OK.

Very innovative! The classic was super bomb...I mean, my hubs went on to have 3 of them;)The menu is larger than I had imagined...and everything was enticing. We decided on a few small plates to share and then ordered our own entrees...which we also tried. Our waitress even brought extra plates to encourage the entree sharing. For starters we went with the baked oysters, and chicken liver. YOWSAS! My only regret is not ordering more oysters. The chicken liver was good, it was very rich and came with in a hearty helping. For mains, we ordered a couple of the pastas, the pork chop, and I went with the steak frites. All of it was so yummy! I would say all of the plates are on the small side, even the entrees, so order accordingly. We went on to order the banana rum cake for dessert. It was out of this world. I would have to say one of my fav dishes:)After dinner drinks, of course, why not. I was so in the mood for a chocolate martini but much to my dismay they did not offer one. I asked the waitress and she said she would see what they could come up with. BAM! Chocolate martini! She said they had a little bottle of chocolate liquor left over for a tasting and the bartender whipped me one right up. I'm not sure where this little magic bottle came from but I'll take it.

They use bowls to soak your feet, which didn't bother me. I first had boiling hot water, but my technician happily adjusted it. The bench I sat on was pretty uncomfortable because I'm very short so I had to scoot far forward in order for my feet could reach the bowl.

I chose a very light color so the technician applied a third coat to my big toes, which I was very grateful for.

She shaped them well and I like the way they look but all ths talk about how sugar is better than wax is a crock of shit. My skin is slightly sensitive/normal and I came out of that salon looking like someone had beat me with a bat.

I also had picked a white polish which was a huge mistake. It looked like a child had painted my nails because it was so uneven. So with an appointment my sloppy manicure took an hour and 45 minutes of my day. Not worth it. However it did last 3 weeks, for better or worse I guess. The staff was very apologetic about my wait time which was nice, and someone called me after I left to offer me a free deep conditioning treatment and blow out for my inconvenience. Very nice gesture however the last thing I wanted to do after my experience was go spend more time there. After a few months I had the guts to make an appointment to go back for my second manicure. I was taken on time which made me so relieved. But that's where the positive stops. My manicurist hurt me - as she was trimming my cuticles she was jabbing me and it caused some of my fingers to bleed a little (see photo). And this manicure chipped after 2 days.

So I found Adam & Sons on Yelp and went in person to see if they would be able to create an arrangement in such short notice. They confirmed it would be no problem and I was actually excited as I saw their website of many beautiful arrangements. Usually the shop will offer a book of pictures to show what kind of arrangements they can do but instead the guy asked how much we were willing to spend. I told him $80-$100 per arrangement (we've never spent more than $85 per arrangement). He said no problem, the florist (i think its his mom) will chose the flowers to fit our budget but she does an amazing job and charged us $100 per arrangement.The next day I got a call that the arrangements were ready so we went to pick them up & unfortunately I was LESS than impressed. In the past $80 covered gorgeous arrangements that included many tulips, roses, carnations & a few other exotic looking flowers.... this time our money got us 4 roses a few carnations & a lot of yellow daisies.

When I told him the few things I needed for the wedding, he said that the florist (whose name escapes me at the moment) was booked that day but might be able to squeeze in the few arrangements I needed. He left her a note and she got back to me the next day to say that she could fit them in! AND she could do it within the budget. Hallelujah! In person, I would have hugged her (so probably a good thing it was over the phone). Everything (bridal bouquet, 3 corsages, 3 boutonnieres) was ready on time the morning-of and looked fresh and beautiful - that is, until the bridal bouquet was out in the wind and rain that came to celebrate that day...The service was friendly and helpful and the product was fresh and beautiful.

An amazing location, with a great view, made even better on nice sunny days. Unfortunately, the food is just ok and the service leaves a lot to be desired. We walked here with our dog via the 606 on Sunday looking forward to grabbing brunch. There was no host stand, just a sign that said to seat yourself. Luckily we found the last umbrella'ed table and sat down. Maybe it would have been better if we hadn't. 15 minutes until anyone even acknowledged our existence when a bus boy came by with waters. He was under the impression that we had already ordered (but then wouldn't we already have had our waters....)21 minutes until the server finally showed up with menus AFTER I finally went inside to see if anyone would actually come to our table. After 40 minutes from the moment we sat down (I only know this because I checked my phone when we got there to see how long the walk from Bucktown took), we got our mediocre french toast and breakfast sandwich. There was nothing really wrong with the food, but it wasn't anything special. I could have easily made both at home, minus the cost and walk. Really what got me about the whole experience is the fact that nobody cared that tables are waiting so long for a menu, drink, food, etc. I had plenty of time to observe other tables and see that their experiences seemed pretty similar. The only thing I can think of is that the owners hired waitstaff that had never worked at a restaurant before. (I have and I know how it can be when things are busy, etc. but it was not busy while we were there and no matter how busy it should not take a server 21 minutes to come see their table!)So, so disappointed.

However, a nice staff isn't enough to overcome amateur-hour service issues.First off, it seems as if the staff rotates taking tables, rather than each one being giving a section. This means when it's busy they can't really keep track of who's waiting on who--either you'll sit there with no one approaching your table (because the staff assumes someone else already took the table), or you'll have more than one server try and wait on you. My advice? Assign sections and stick to it. Much less confusion for everyone.We sat outside (as did everyone else that morning) rather than sit inside. It was pretty close to when they opened so it wasn't too crowded yet. Our server approached us with menus and took our beverage order, then came back a short time later to take our food order. So far so good.I ordered an omelette with three ingredients, and my husband ordered fruit and granola, as well as two eggs. He asked about the choice of toast, the only options were white, challah, or ciabatta. He chose ciabatta. I noticed the waitress didn't write anything down.A few minutes later she comes back and asks me to repeat my order, which I did. If you're not a seasoned server (she clearly was not), it's probably best if you write things down if you can't remember.Then we waited. And waited some more. The outside tables were filling up fast. It seemed as if no one had their food.We finally got our food...after about 35 minutes. And of course my omelette was wrong, and the potatoes that were supposed to come with my husband's eggs were inexplicable replaced with a salad. We pointed this out to our server, who asked if my husband ordered potatoes. He had to point out that menu stated they were served with the eggs. She apologized and asked if he still wanted them. I chose to eat my omelette as is because I sure didn't want to wait another half hour for my correct food. The toast was most definitely not ciabatta. I'm pretty sure it was Wonder bread.To make up for the long wait, she gave us an apple fritter on the house, so that was nice. She was always friendly and tried to do her best, but man, I'm pretty sure she may have never waited on tables before in her life.We also noticed that people who arrived at least thirty minutes after us were served their food only about 5 minutes after we got ours. Why did we have to wait so long while their food was served in a reasonable amount of time? The world may never know.The food was decent, nay, good. Everyone was nice. The view is lovely.

I chose the latter.I feel bad for being the first review not to five-star El Sitio. I wanted to give it five stars. I'm an optimist. I want everyone to be happy. I want to do nothing but heap praise. So I'll at least start out by saying that the meal was nothing short of kick-ass. We got the Pico Pollo, their signature dish, an awesome take on fried chicken, with fried plantain chips. I will go so far as to say that their fried chicken is among the best I've had in the city. The spice profile is distinctively different from any fried chicken I've had. What was interesting was that it was all cut up in such a way that you can't really tell what part of the chicken you're eating. Sounds weird but it was kinda fun, like you're being forced to think about chicken in a new light. The plantain chips are tasty as can be. We also got the yucca simmered with red onions, and man oh Manischevitz, that stuff is good. Yucca is awesome. It's like \"nature's potato.\"So, yeah, the meal was pretty terrific. Not five stars, but four stars. Nothing about the meal was mind-blowingly off-the-charts, but it was a lot of very delicious food for very reasonable prices.The next star comes off due to the service. We went on a super-gloomy rainy Friday, and when we went in, the place was empty. Dead. One other table, apparently full of friends of the owners and / or staff. Now, under such conditions, I think it's reasonable to expect that:- The food should not take forty minutes to arrive.- We shouldn't have to flag down someone to bring us our left-over containers.- We shouldn't have to go to the counter to get the check.Now, the service wasn't rude, mind you. The staff was for the most part very friendly. But they seemed more interested in singing along with the loud Dominican music and watching pro wrestling with their friends than taking care of the one table they had for the night.Also weird was that one of the servers wouldn't put things on the table. I'm eating my chicken and I have to put it down because he's holding my Diet Coke up for me to take. WTF huh?But the food was great, the portions were huge and the prices were very nice. So I can't say I wouldn't go back. It's just, you have to know what you're in for.

The tune up was said to fix my flat tire among other things, in which they told me would be covered under the specific tune up package. After receiving my bike, the tire was not properly fixed to the rim, resulting in the flat not being fixed. Then having to leave my bike there for another day, they specifically explained to me it was the inner tube that needed fixing, an additional $5.49. Also having to take a $10 cab ride to work. The next morning, the tire was flat again, in which I had to walk the bike to the shop AGAIN, in order to fix the flat. They stated, it was bad tubing and replaced the tube again. They also stated after I asked them about these rips in the tire if it was the tire. They specifically said no, those are just little tears from wear and tear. Another $10 cab ride to work.The third day, my bike looked fine the tire was enflated. I went from Division/Homan to Ohio/Grand before I got yet another flat tire. I called them about the issue again, they said Ok it's probably your tire. So an addition to the $81 tune up package, plus an additional $18 for a new tire. I will hopefully pick up my bike today good and ready to go. I realize this is maybe not considered a professional shop, however, my expectations were high in the sense they should have inspected my tire the first time in order to rule out any possible issues and to proceed to the fix.

The guys in the shop were friendly and seemed knowledgeable however my specific experience leads me to believe that they are not in terms of solving difficult problems.

All in all I wish I could receive a refund for the tune up package, but I doubt that will be happening. I paid $99 total for mediocre repairs--if you want to call them that and overall was not satisfied as their incomplete repairs have caused lead to me to be late to work almost the entire week, and paying $40 in cab fare.

Ciclo Urbano is buzzing with activity and a friendly atmosphere. I was able to get my bike repaired and save some money.I decided to ride my mountain bike on a trail for the first time this summer. Unfortunately, I got stranded with a non working bike in the middle of a forest with mosquitoes voraciously attacking me and deer feeding on grass in the background. Fortunately, I was able to walk back to civilization and have a family member give me a ride back to my car. The next day I was determined to get my bike fixed, so that I could use it before the good weather passes me by. The rear wheel on my bike wasn't moving when I moved the front pedals. I did some research on the internet and found out it had something to do with the rear hub assembly. There were several videos on YouTube were mechanics \u00a0were servicing the free hub cartridge of the rear hub.However, when I went to Performance & two Kozy's bike stores the mechanics told me the rear hub couldn't be serviced and that I had to buy a new wheel for $90, chain for $20 and rear sprocket cassette for about $40. My bike is a 16 year old Trek 820, so I didn't want to spend close to $200 for the repair. Luckily, I came across Ciclo Urbano while doing a search for bicycle repairs and used bikes on Google. As soon As I brought my bike and explained my problem, Jean Carlos & Felix knew what was causing my problem. They showed me the Shimano free hub cassette replacement part; and I gave them the ok to replace the part. Jean Carlos replaced the part within 30 minutes. He did what three other so called professional shop mechanics said was impossible or too time consuming. He let me watch him while he worked and answered a lot of my questions. You could tell he loves what he's doing. He also replaced my rear shifter cable, replaced my chain and adjusted my brakes for much less than my previous estimates.The store and bike shop have a friendly vibe and you could sense the camaraderie amongst the young mechanics.

I just want to find my wallet. Secondly, I had to drive all the way down here because you're too cool to answer the phone, and when I arrive you're too important and popular to let me in to ask about my wallet, I have to wait on the curb?

I used to go to clipper pretty frequently. The lighting is so dim now, I couldn't read the new menu, and I have good eyes. Maybe they are having trouble paying the electric bill lately! It's more like horror show red now, the lights were barely on, and everything was in a eerie red glow. I kept waiting for Freddy Cougar to pop out of one of the bars! The fake books on the bookshelves and stuffed leather chairs just seemed super pretentious, and not cool or fitting in with the character of the bar. Since, there is no way you'd be able to read them in the darkness. The boardgames appeared to be gone, but it was hard to see anything there.I ordered a Purple Martin, and the waitress said they don't have that anymore! COME ON!!! Even they though added 100 other drinks, why no purple martin? I thought that was the signature drink there! Lame. I ordered a couple other mixed drinks, and the prices seem higher now and the drinks seemed kind of off. I was hoping at least the bathrooms would have been extensively remodeled but alas, the only thing that seemed to be different was a privacy door, some fancy looking bottled soap, and an extra cheap looking sink. That was the only part that I thought needed changing, was adding clean modern bathrooms.Also, on a Saturday night there was no band. Although, they reassured me that would be forthcoming. I sure hope so! I mean this was already a classic bar from the 30's. I don't get why they had to crank up the fake pretentiousness factor. It was already a really cool place to go.

Keep the Clipper alive. But don't be a part of the #2 subset. Appreciate the hard work that goes into live music. Dance and clap. But don't roll-up 5-deep and talk over the music and moan about how there's no seats to play a board game on, then order 10 cocktails and shots and hold-up the bartender for 30 minutes. Go to Guthrie's or some other dumb shack in Wrigleyville for that. I'm not saying the Clipper has to be a library, but you shouldn't have to act like you're at a sports bar in a college town, either. Nor be a craft cocktail snob. Nor show up in your nasty knit caps and pretend you're in some newly-undiscovered dive. Grow-up and appreciate the arts.

You get a lot of fries, by the way...probably more than I've ever been able to finish.Just note that the hot dogs, even with everything, are not quite exactly classic Chicago style, since the buns don't have poppyseeds and I don't think they use neon green relish.

The cards can be a little weird but I still really enjoyed it, \u00a0the books also had the same slightly skewed range of topics, a little weird but interesting. 'Armchair quarterback playbook,' 'Stuff every man should know' definitely an interesting selection along with other books that didn't really hold my attention. The jewelry section was what caught my date's attention which was really vast, but the display also had a collection of Buck knives as well as a lot of different lotions and perfumes, as well as some shave oil and other grooming items. The cosmopolitan mix of clothes, books, toys, stationary, jewelry and lotions is enough to earn three stars right off the bat.What else stood out was the service. My date asked where the owner's dogs were and she said they were home that day. Funny thing is that someone else came in a few minutes later and asked the same question.

I surreptitiously took the little thing off the table and when my girl was busy looking around I managed to get the owner's attention while she was unpacking merchandise gestured for her not to say a word and gave her my credit card. She rang it up and even wrapped it by the time my date was ready with her purchase. It was funny that she got nervous for me but she managed to put the beautifully wrapped soon to be gift out of sight, rang my date's purchase up, hid my receipt out of the sight of my girl's eyes and then packed my stuff into a bag before my date could even notice what was in my shopping bag.

The prices are right in line with my budget, there's a vast selection of items in the store, from perfumes; soap; jewelry; incense; books...basically items that you don't really see anywhere else. I recently purchased from Komoda a huge bar of olive oil soap (pre de Province--Marseille) and a dish for it to sit on. My fiancee, Jen, thought it was the perfect addition to our bathroom. She really likes the soap because of the moisturizing compounds mostly \u00a0consisting of olive oil. I use it because it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry, especially after shaving. Awesome!My overall experience with Komoda always leaves me feeling as though I've been on a journey to another part of the world: Remember Harry Potter in his earlier movies when he goes to 'Diagon Alley? He exclaims, \"...It's like magic!\" Well, that's one of the ways that I feel about going into Komoda. On my last visit there and speaking with Sherri (the shop owner, who has this uncanny ability to remember her customers by first names), I told her that coming into her shop was akin to going to visit my aunt as a child. My aunt had so many different and wonderful things to examine and explore; it was the equivalent of an adventure...exciting; mysterious; loads of fun; nice smells--like I could just stay there forever. \u00a0Anyway, this is a great place to shop where you not only get great customer service (direct from the owner herself), but you walk out feeling as though you know that you'll be back, even if you didn't make a purchase. When I first visited the shop I didn't make a purchase. Just merely made observations. When I walked out I knew I would be back. And I have every since (three years).My bet is that once you walk in, you're hooked. Sherri and Dominick are as down-to-earth, warm \u00a0and friendly as you could expect. Dominick is behind the scenes and works the technical end of the business (Hope you have the chance to meet him at some point--cool beans). \u00a0BTW--Keep your eyes peeled for their online store coming very soon!

Before returning to NYC, I asked my friend's wife, where I should go to buy things for people back in Manhattan. Without hesitation, she suggested I go to \"her favorite store in Chicago\". This was exactly the suggestion I wanted, as I wasn't really interested in buying people back home anything. Instead, I intended to find a gift for her, and their amazing young daughter, for welcoming me into their home so graciously.I headed down to Komoda on a late Monday afternoon. I pored over an array of quality products, and intelligent gift ideas. As usual, I was quickly overwhelmed with trying to find the 'perfect gift', which this situation called for. I soon found myself consulting the sales associate on duty, Linda.I explained to Linda exactly what brought me into the store, with little expectation that sharing my situation would bring me closer to finding the 'exact gift' that I needed. Linda (who only works once a week-so she's not as familiar with the regulars) was quick to suggest that she call the owner of the store (Sherry), because she 'had a photographic memory' of the stores customers. I agreed. Once Linda had shared some of my description of my friend (and his family) Sherry quickly filled in some blanks, describing their daughter's name, and professions. I was so absolutely surprised by the immediate connection. Sherry made a suggestion (through Linda) from past purchases of my friends wife, which I followed exactly. I also found a couple very cool gifts for the precious youngest lady in the house, including a mind challenging activity book. I even threw in a couple extra things that I didn't come for, likely because I felt so good about the entire experience.In closing, I can certainly see why this store came so highly recommended. Linda was thorough, kind, sweet, friendly, patient, creative and professional helping me find 'the perfect gift'. Her approach to her job I found highly commendable for an employee who only works once a week. I assume that has a lot to do with the hiring and training procedure (starting from the top down), focused on the right person for the company. I was also absolutely impressed at how in tune with her customers the owner Sherry was. It was easy to see that calling her for this kind of information was not frowned upon, to satisfy their client.

Incredible service! IPRAC's mission is to build awareness and showcase Puerto Rican art, and to make it accessible to all visitors. Mission accomplished.The art exhibit was well worth a visit, but small, so I was also shown other public spaces that will be available for rent or for community classes. The building used to be a horse's stable back in the day that German immigrants prevailed in the area and the hayloft and basement are still unfinished in that style (although I wish I could have seen those, but did not). As dignitaries (hopefully the deep pocket kind) were being given a tour prior to an opening Gala for \"A year of Antonio Martorell in Chicago 2011 - 12\", I was also shown indoor and outdoor space available for rental. Check out IPRAC's website for event space rental options. IPRAC is a great example of how vacant space can be used to improve the lives of the local community at large.

Built at the turn of the last century, when German families were the majority inhabitants of Humboldt Park (and only 30 years after the area received that name), it served then a useful purpose: caring for the carriages and horses of the visitors to the grand park land. After the waning of the age of horse-drawn transportation, the stables building fell into disuse and neglect. Almost a hundred years later, the community and the city's Park District were moved to restore the building. But in 1992, a serious fire destroyed much of the roof and some of the ground floor. Rebuilding that took 6 years. More renovations are ongoing.Today, the building looks brand new, but historically accurate, due to the efforts to make it into the IPRAC. The institute was one of the participating sites in the second *Open House Chicago weekend event (Oct. 13 &14, 2012)*, opening its doors to the general public free of admission charge for guided tours of the facilities. The Institute can host your special event, wedding, or corporate meeting with many amenities you will not find elsewhere. It is well worth your visit as a Chicagoan or an appreciator of architecture. Underway is the restoration of the corner office of Danish immigrant and master landscape architect Jens Jensen, who in the 1890's was Superintendent of Humboldt Park and, later, of Chicago's West Park System.*For more about Open House Chicago (an event of the Chicago Architecture Foundation), see: tinyurl.com/948btuq .", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 10, 13]}}, "neighborhoods": ["West Town", "Humboldt Park"], "latitude": 41.9027151, "longitude": -87.7024833, "rating": "5.0", "times": {"Mon": ["12:30 pm", "5:30 pm"], "Thu": [], "Sat": ["9:00 am", "2:00 pm"], "Wed": ["12:30 pm", "5:30 pm"], "Tue": [], "Sun": [], "Fri": ["12:30 pm", "5:30 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Art Galleries", "galleries"]], "address": ["3015 W Division St"], "attributes": {"By Appointment Only": "No", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "No", "Good for Kids": "Yes"}, "category": "Shopping", "number_of_reviews": "4"}, "feed-chicago": {"comments": {"58": {"description": "A great deal on tasty food.

The fried green tomatoes they sit on were ok, but the cornbread was blah. The corn pudding which I subbed for the potatoes was pretty good. The bacon I got on the side was awful- cold, dry, flaky, not good.Bf wasn't psyched about the pozole since it was a really thick stew instead of a soup and was fairly bland.

It's not to just give compliments. I leave MANY positive reviews because I'm having great experiences in Chicago. This was not one of them. If you're a business owner unprepared to hear what people really think, you should probably just stop checking Yelp. Or perhaps make an effort to offer your customers a great experience instead of sending them hostile messages to go back to where they came from.

I looked \u00a0up on Yelp \"good pizza places\" cause I wanted a Chicken Parm.

When I finally confirmed on Yelp that it was here, I dropped by for some quick takeout. It's definitely smalltime. They only had one type of thin crust and one type of thick crust available for slice sale, not sure if that's always the case, but when I asked if there were any other varieties coming soon the guy behind the counter looked at me like like I had three heads, so I'm thinking the limited choice is the norm. I got a thin crust sausage slice with a soda for $5. The slice was basically a quarter or fifth of a pizza, the equivalent of two of what I consider normal slice size, and more than I could eat in one sitting. This reminded me a lot of a mid-range New York slice, at least when looking at it from above, although the crust wasn't crispy enough, it was still sort of doughy and not as good as standard New York fare.Overall, if you order a pie or are okay with limited selection, it's not a bad option, and was a decent slice. I'm glad I checked it out, and I expect I'll stop back in. It seemed like there was plenty of easy parking nearby. There's no seating.

The ciabatta bread is freaking perfect (I make bread and lived in Europe for years, so I'm a bit picky about bread) and the topping to bread ratio also is just right.What makes all of this so cool is that the owner is a nice guy who loves to chat and cares about his food a lot.

I am leaning more towards 5-6 hours and that is not including the eating part. I always have a dream where I can whip these up at home but the reality is that this is not going to happen. Recently a friend decided to bring these to a morning meeting instead of donuts. I thought it was a great idea except for starting my day out with lard. I really made an effort to block the though of lard in my veins and dived in. As we sat there and ate my friend told a story about his adventure buying these. He arrived at 5am to order them and learned he needed cash. He then went to an ATM and upon his return there was a line out the front door. The moral of this story is to always have cash when ordering Mexican food because you just never know. We laughed and dove into the tamales and all enjoyed them. I love tamales but I always find the corn to be dry. This has been something I've experienced since having my first one over 30 years ago. I found one restaurant in Chicago that made a juicy veggie tamale but they are no longer in business (RIP La Finca). I really wish I had that recipe. I did not go to this place to pickup the tamales. They were basically delivered to our meeting. I was amazed that they were still warm in the sealed plastic bags they were packed in. Remember it was 9am and he grabbed them at 5:30am. I was just really happy to have an authentic treat for breakfast. I will say it was my first morning tamale. If I was to judge these with every tamale I have ever had then I would put these on the line of traditional authentic tamales. We had two different flavors to choose from. There was a chicken with red sauce & pork with green sauce. Typically these two are flipped (pork & red and chicken & green) but I enjoyed the different combination. Personally I think most people don't order those and our dear friend picking them up was not in the know when it came to ordering. The staff basically ordered for him. He will be ready the next time, if there is a next time. I am giving these tamales a 4 star rating because they are consistent to what a good Chicago Mexican restaurants offers. Now if you have a kick butt tamale then please send it my way. Also I know many places are making yummy topping sauces. Please don't send me there because I could cover an old shoe in green salsa and it would taste amazing. So grab your cash and get in line because these tamales are hot out of the steamer.

Alex works for my wife and I. We own a bike shop. Alex went to Rachael first, second and third. Alex doesn't talk (a lot) but when he does you listen. I think his comment when I finally asked was \"she knows what she's doing\". Then there was an ambiguous comment about BE READY. So I lost 20 pounds and my wife got hotter and we decided to reward ourselves after a quarter century of loving each other with this experience. So we booked consecutive appointments and watched each other as Rachael went to work. I was first - Rachael knows us from the bike shop and briefly asked me about the herniated discs (L1/S5) and went to work. On the lower half of my body. Why? Cause she knows what she is doing. The problem with customers in both of our businesses is ignoring the disinformation. The problem with my back is the effect, not the cause. Curious if Rachael agrees. So my poor wife had to endure an hour of watching Rachael using suction, elbows, body weight and leverage against my aging lower body as I struggled to let her in to get the job done. I walked off the table feeling like an ATHLETE and then was very curious what Rachael's plan was for my wife. Linda was recently out of arthroscopic hip surgery that resulted (after 8 hours) in the surgeon telling her mother and her husband that he was suprised to see the amount of arthritis in her hip and that hip replacement was definitely in her future. In the interim, physical therapy and pain management were the next best plan. He was even so kind as to explain to my mother-in-law and I that my wife had a hip joint very similar to a labrador retriever meaning their is essentially no socket and the hip bone justs rotates around a vague semi-circle of hip joint. Rachael's approach to my wife used an entirely different set of tools and techniques. The suction cup was out a new vibrating tool was in. She immediately noticed a leg length discrepency that Linda verified was identified prior to surgery. I'm guessing less than an 1\" but what was interesting to me was could this session get a perfectly healthy hot 50 year old back to even leg length cause I'm pretty darn sure that's what I married a quarter century ago. Yes she did. And (two) Epsom salt bath's later we're really looking forward to our next appointment (s) and the pleasure of Rachael's company.

Bodywork is something that EVERYONE should treat themselves to, even if you aren't feeling pain. Sitting all day, standing all day, being active, riding your bike, running - it all puts us into dysfunction in some way or another. First of all, her communication is fantastic. You can text her and/or call her (pretty sure you can email her as well). She responds quickly and will find a time that works for you. After my visit, she contacted me via text around 2 days after I saw her. That's some great customer service! I was in quite a bit of pain and wanting to see someone immediately to feel some relief. I've had ongoing pain from injuries stemming from running and lifting. I've been going to physical therapy on/off (moreso on) for years, as well as seeing different sports Docs. With the frustration of at least getting some short term relief between physical therapy appointments, I called several massage therapists and body work folks. Rachael was the person I absolutely wanted to see. Just look at her reviews here. Look at her website. She is a person who is clearly passionate about what she does. She loves what she does. I couldn't wait to meet her. This isn't a spa experience. You're in a Chicago apartment in a room with windows overlooking garages and apartments in Logan Square. Bring comfortable, loose clothing. You have no choice but to stay present to the session! For those of you who haven't had active release technique, cupping and Graston technique, you are in for a real treat! Rachael uses similar methodologies and tailors it to what your body is telling her. Her release on iliopsoas and stretches for my sacroiliac joint pain and cupping/IATSM (look it up on her website) work on my knee (which hasn't been the same since knee surgery) is what my body needed. She also worked on my pecs due to the shoulder blade pain I've been having. I requested 2 hours for my first session with her; I felt like a million bucks walking out. To walk down the stairs with no knee pain after her appointment was incredible. She gave me some stretches to do to maintain proper form, suggested supplements to buy as well as what to eat after the session. She is realistic about the knots/soreness/pain that may or may not remain after the session. I truly appreciate her honesty. Prior to my appointment with her, she recommended an Epsom salt soak. The pain had been so bad for days I was waking up in the middle of the night and really agitated. I had never done one before as I thought it was for old people (talk about being a moron!). I slept like a baby that night. She also recommended the bath toward the end of the day after my appointment. It was a good call! The work she does is not particularly pleasant (kudos to the reviewer who said \"This is not for wimps!\"), but it gets you results. Your body is your home; if you're willing to maintain everything else but your body, that's a damn shame. Your body will eventually tell you with pain that it needs you to do something about it. So do it. Go to Rachael and educate yourself on your body on your own time. Don't just rely on a Doctor to do it. (End rant)I really enjoyed talking to her during our session and hope that more people patronize her and see the relief she brings. She is a really wonderful, strong, authentic person.

She focused on my problem area and when she worked on my chest muscles and shoulder muscles, she explained how those muscles are contributing to my back pain. Seriously knowledgeable.

Searching around on the site, I came across a few options here in Chicago. Searching around on foot, I decided on Tropical Taste. You know the phrase, \"Feets don't fail me now?\" My feets? They failed me.What looks warm and inviting from the street is anything but on the inside. I'm not talking furniture or decor. I am talking about the rude ways in which the owner/cook/bodyguard/whoeversheis treating my party and in particular, me. I walked in, smiled and went about being my charming, adorable self. I was addressed in Spanish, I replied that I didn't speak Spanish (in Spanish) and the fun began. We were yelled at -- from the counter -- to give our orders within minutes of sitting down. Other tables were waited on. We were given a small selection of dishes from which to order. Other tables were given special menus and secret sauces (seriously). We were given food that may or not have been sitting around for a while. Other tables were given food so hot we saw steam rise from it. In particular, I ordered a fish dish with coconut milk. I was given (almost immediately after ordering) a cold fish dish with coconut milk. Cold. Fish. That had been cooked. Our tostones? No sauce. And dry. Very. Very. Very. Dry. I looked up at the counter (and at our antagonist) to inquire about wth was going on and received a \"QUE?!\" barked like from the mouth of a rabid pelican. Toucan. Rabid toucan.Basically, I was made to feel as though if I didn't speak Spanish, I was not welcome to be here. Fine. Cool. I get it. You want a certain clientele and that's it. Free country. Do you. The thing is, don't take my money. Don't open for business to the public. Get a dinner club license or something. Open to those on a mailing list.

(She even served us beverages, alcoholic and non-, to ensure that we would be replicating our \"real lives\" on the couch). We ultimately ended up buying a complete living room set with the entirety of our wedding money.The twist in the story is that my husband and I shipped the vinyl couch home only to discover that there was a spot that was damaged beyond repair (due to a cleaning liquid spill that had preceded Claire's purchase). Claire generously referred us to a leather/vinyl expert, who provided us with thorough information about our couch and the material. When my husband and I learned that our couch would not endure a lifetime, Claire immediately offered to exchange the piece ($2400 store credit) with one that would meet our needs. Claire was extraordinarily accommodating, professional, and honest - making it clear that her interest was in our satisfaction - not in her financial gainBOTTOM LINE: The reason I am writing this review is because, if you are thinking of going to Restoration Hardware - THINK AGAIN! You will never receive the kind of personal, caring, and responsive customer service that you will get from Claire and her staff at The Humboldt House. It is clear that she is passionate about her craft, and eager to share beautiful pieces with those of us who would have succumbed to Ethan Allen, otherwise.

Why the quality did not match the price? Some of pieces you could easily fine at the Brown Elephant for 80% off of what Humboldt House charges. The past two reviewers rave about the price, but as a frequent buyer, I'm not going to sacrifice quality for price. Other places in Chicago offer the same price for items that are 200x better quality. The place has a musty smell, which leads me to believe that the owner is not treating and taking care of the linens/tapestries that she's bringing in. \u00a0The place also could use a merchandising refresh...lots of holes in the wall, no order or reason to presentation. It looked like the owner just threw some things around. On top of the quality and presentation, I was very disappointed with the customer service.

Veggies were the star.Smoked fish plate was BOMB. 5 different fish varieties served w awesome bread, cream cheese and capers. Hot damn, best smoked fish plate I've ever had.Half chicken- holy mother of god. This was mind blowing, the chicken tasted like a ham and was perfectly prepared. Best chicken dish in the city imo.Snapper special- served whole and was amazing. I wish it was permanently on the menu.

Then, she also told me that i only have a script written for clear and not color! and that i would have to REPAY for another visit! Pissed off, i thanked her and hung up.5- Three seconds later, i looked at my walmart recipt from the visit and realized that my 3 months didnt even expire yet!! i STILL had a week till 3 months were over!! So now not only am i supposed to adhere to their fake deadline \u00a0( 3 months vs 6) , they also tried to jip me out of the fake deadline! Ugh6- Finally, i went in personally ( what crap!), and then the lady told me the same exact thing, with the doctor hovering over her. I finally realized the doctor was right there, i asked him if he would fix my script. He nodded as if he was making me a deal, and then said \" sure , sure, .. do u plan on buying something from the office?\" WTF? Are u serious?? This is my script, u screwed up and now u give me this wicked smile and try to get me to buy something? Anyhow, i said that i have to buy a pair of glasses next week or so. The office then made me wait another 15 min, then she came out with my prescription.GRIMEY. \u00a0I will NEVER VISIT dr. Jose Montes's walmart clinic again.

I tried a bite of it and it tasted ok, but yeah... just ok, which was shocking given how yummy it looked. I think it was because the black bean cakes were softer than expected. I was thinking they would be more like the texture of a black bean burger... more together... but instead the cakes were softer/mushier/creamier than expected.

Less potatoes one time, less gravy another. Also, for a cash only, sit down spot, the prices are a little higher. It's not that I'm that cheap, and if I want cheap breakfast I'll make it myself. But of all the spots that I enjoy that are cash only, this is one I feel should update that policy. Back to positives.

The OJ was a little steeply prices ($8) but I guess that's ok for a BYOB brunch spot. If you are with a vegetarian this is definitely worth trying, as they have a number of vegetarian items and also can make most of the other items vegetarian if you ask.

Have him work in a bar in wrigleyville or in a late night vegan diner in lakeview where teenagers that don't tip hang out. Then maybe he'll appreciate where he's at a bit more.

So I'm attempting to re-post it because I love this place: So many great things to say about this place. I discovered Parlor 836 as I was driving up Damen on my way to somewhere else. The first time I went in, the person at the front was very friendly and welcoming. I found out later that it was one of the owners, Vanessa. I didn't have an appointment but she gladly accommodated my sporadic request for an eyebrow threading/tinting, leg waxing and a mani and pedi. Vanessa did my eyebrow threading/tinting and also my waxing. She did a FABULOUS job! I can't recall the name of the girl that did my mani/pedi but she was super friendly and I recall having a conversation with her about our mutual love for dogs. The second time I came in I didn't have an appointment either, again they accommodated me. More recently, just a few weeks ago, I made an appointment because I knew it would be busy due to the holidays. I had scheduled a mani/pedi and leg waxing. Well, while I was there, true to my sporadic nature, I wanted to add-on another service...a Brazilian wax. Vanessa checked the schedule and found out she would be able to squeeze me in, in between one client and the next. My mani/pedi this time was done by one of the other owners, Jessica. Jessica is so sweet and seems like an all around great person. She did a fabulous job on my hands and feet. She's so meticulous in her work and when she was done it looked great. During one of my visits, I found out that Vanessa & Jessica happen to be sisters. I love the fact that we have a local family owned small business in our community that provides amazing quality services. Both are so down-to-earth and I feel like I'm at home when I go there. It's a very comfortable place to be.In regards to the ambiance, the place is very simple but very warm and welcoming. They put out beverages for clients to partake of.

I was given a prenatal 60 min massage and mani/pedi. The mani/pedi was good. Nothing out of this world but they did do a nice job. The pedi seating is not as comfortable as other shops (the seat is too high so you can't get your feet in the water unless you sit at the edge of the chair (so you aren't able to relax as much as you might like until you are done in the water). Regardless, left with my nails looking great. My prenatal massage was another story. I hope to provide the right expectations for those considering. I went in thinking I'd be on a bed with the whole in the middle (have had these prenatal massages other places) and that's not what they had. Thus the option was to lie on my side. For me in my pregnancy, this is by far the most uncomfortable position (very tight hips) so things were off to a bad start. I was offered the option to skip it and keep the certificate for something else. However, I had saved this to be my last massage (I'm due in 4 weeks) and was mostly upset that this information wasn't provided when I booked the appointment. So I'm on my side and I personally found it worse for my body. Additionally, I was given a fleece blanket to put between my knees for comfort, but I was not comfortable using it as I felt it had been used by someone else prior. When I've had massages in the past, there is a particular pattern that I feel happens to properly work out your back. Not with this experience. It was literally all over the place, from shoulders to my low back and back to my shoulders. It was so sporadic that there were moments where I questioned the experience level of the male masseuse. I was later told he's been doing this for 10 years, so maybe I'm the odd gal out who doesn't care for his \"style.\" \u00a0There was clearly frustration from him when I did provide feedback that it was too hard and despite my trying to finish the massage, I was told it was over (10 min before my 60 min were up) I guess becuase it was clear how uncomfortable I was. Nonetheless, it was akward and left me really annoyed. Their pricing is clearly competitive and that's a plus but I would not suggest a prenatal massage from this place.

After my fianc\u00e9 (now husband) and I went to Paper source and Papyrus and a few other places that showed us the same books over and over again, I felt crazy because I couldn't find anything that I absolutely loved. I got the idea that maybe there was somewhere that I could have them made exactly like I imagined them in my head. After a quick google search I found Stacey. I went to her awesome studio and she showed me some of her great designs. I picked and chose elements that I really liked and we came up with exactly what I was looking for. \u00a0We had an issue with one of my ideas and it's functionality. But she worked with the materials and made it awesome. She addressed each invitation, a process that we went back and forth on for a while since it was difficult to get my guests' correct addresses. But Stacey was so accommodating, always available to talk or meet up, even after hours. The invitations were mailed out and many guests called me to tell me how beautiful they were. A WEEK before the wedding I finally got the final head count. Stacey printed out escort cards in the shape of flags which were placed on sticks and into mini-succulent plants for each guest. She also made menus with each guest's name on them for a 2-in-1 place card/menu...which I thought was brilliant. All-in-all, they were mailed to me overnight to NYC where I received them in enough time to get them to the florist/venue. Stacey and her team are very creative and their work is beautiful.

I have been to this place one before; there was good service, our waitress even took a shot with us. Excellent. On my most recent visit, I experienced a complete atrocity. I planned a birthday gathering, the woman who helped explain the wristband options was very polite and helpful. It seemed like everything would go smoothly. I arrive at 10:15pm, I immediately notice the bartender being hostile to my group of 3 male friends. 2 of those friends are business owners and I'm immediately embarrassed at how they have been treated. She is very obviously disinterested. \u00a0One more small group of female friends arrive, one friend orders a drink (not a wristband) she is very clearly upset by this and responds in a very rude tone that she will grab that drink. I understand I overestimated how many people would actually purchase a wristband, it is still early and still not an excuse for the behavior. We brush this off, maybe she's having a bad day. Maybe she will cheer up when she sees I am bringing in a large crowd, which means a lot of customers, a lot of tabs open. It's barely 11:15pm now. While sitting at the table, my friends and I overhear the bartender saying \"THEY ONLY GOT 2 WRISTBANDS\" to a fellow waitress. Again, her tone isn't pleasant. It's not even midnight, more than half of my party is still on its way. Again, we ignore this. I move up to the front to mingle with my friends at the bar when I hear 3 women say \"They need to go\"...I look back to see the women are telling this to the bartender, (they're obviously friends). She is referring to my 4 friends whom are sitting down, talking amongst themselves. The bartender agrees to do something about it and walks away; the women notice I've overheard their conversation and give me very unpleasant looks. I'm instantly very self aware and realize that neither myself or my friends are welcome at this establishment. I don't know if we were being discriminated or if there was just something they didn't like about us. I am in complete disbelief and confusion as to why we are being treated this way. It was very early so I can vouch my entire party (including myself) was sober, non-disruptive and non-confrontational. Once those looks were done, I go table to table and kindly ask my friends to close out their tabs. They're completely unaware of anything, but agree to leave at my request. This is done peacefully.Once we relocate I notice 2 of my friends are missing, turns out they went home after being asked to leave by the bartender. No explanation. Her review is also somewhere below. That's a terrible story that collaborated with what I was feeling and witnessing. My entire party vacated by no later than 11:30pm and spent our money elsewhere. My night wasn't ruined, thankfully. But this experience is so cringe worthy and I'm embarrassed to even repeat it out loud. Worst experience, easily. I hear great things about the owner himself, if you're reading this, I really hope the bartender is disciplined. The night I speak of was Saturday 12/6. I live very, very close and I wish this could've been a regular place for me. Now I just wish I didn't have to walk the same block to be reminded of this awful experience. I am the kind of person who builds a rapport with my bartenders and travel far if I must because I understand they make the experience that much better.

Not sure if it was just an off night, but I'm sad to say it was almost inedible. It tasted like it was marinated in a watered-down bottled steak sauce. It was so weird tasting, I was afraid the meat was bad. The tater tots were dry, hard, and discolored (pale, almost white in spots) on the outside. I think they were freezer burned. When the server came to collect my plate and saw that I'd eaten only a few bites of my sandwich and almost none of the tots, she asked if I wanted it boxed up. When I declined, she didn't ask if the sandwich was okay. Hm. My friend ordered the fish 'n' chips, which was fine. We also had the cheese balls for an appetizer.

Helpfully, Walgreens' website warned me that this might be too short a window to get the transfer done, but accepted my request nonetheless.There was no wait to pick up my prescription the following day.

Who shops at a head shop with their debit card? There are 57 ATM's near the North/Damen/Milwaukee intersection - use them.

The medium-sized hookah were about $60-70, and the size was perfect for my needs, since i don't need one that's terribly big.Upon going in on another walkabout, they were having a hookah sale, and all their medium-sized hookah were 40-50 dollars. Score!I bought a very nice, medium-sized hookah for $40, then got a couple different flavors of shisha and some quick-light charcoals. Overall, i spent about $60-65. VERY fair price, if you ask me.I recommend this place to anyone who likes hookah; there is an excellent selection of shisha from many different brands, and some are imported from the Middle-east (and are delicious). Now, I'm a real stickler with customer service, too. And the management has always been very helpful and polite.

I bought a few little things, they threw in a free lighter, everything was all good. Then I made a larger purchase there- I bought 2 matching Boom Reload vaporizers, at $80 each. I was unsure of them at first, seeing as I had never heard of the brand, but the staff at Ash's assured me they were high quality, and that they sold them all the time because of how popular they were. What I should've asked was how often people return them. Because when I got home that night and tried out my new toy, I was so disappointed. To be frank, these vaporizers are garbage. I put a pinch of dry herb in its corresponding chamber- all that came out was smoke, NOT VAPOR. It torched my goods, smelt like burning plastic, and the battery took 4 hours to charge, and then died after 20 minutes of being on. Now, I understand that most of this is the fault of the manufacturer. I'm not blaming Ash's for the vape not working. However, when I called them asking about returning it, all I received was attitude and a no return policy that no one warned me about when I made the purchase.They don't tell you this when you buy something, but they only offer exchanges on defective products that haven't been used. THEY DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS EVEN IF THEY SELL YOU BROKEN MERCHANDISE. He wouldn't even do a refund for the vape I never opened. He told me to forget about the one I used once- they won't do anything for you once it's been used. I politely asked how someone is supposed to know if a product is defective or not unless they used it first, and that was when the person on the phone (the same man who sold me the vaporizers) became confrontational and rude, and refused to speak about it any more. I was told if I wanted to say anything more on the matter, I had to come into the store. I thought that that was fair, until he hung up on me as I began to ask their about their hours. Excuse my french but that was when I realized this dude was a total dick. Overall, if you're looking to stop in and buy some papers or a little pipe, you should be fine.

I'm so glad my boyfriend and I did. We went in late Sunday morning for a \"mini-brunch.\" We weren't starving, but wanted a little nosh to hold through for a late lunch ahead. We decided to order four pierogies ($6) and a breakfast plate (two eggs, piece of kielbasa, two pierogies) ($6). For the pierogies, they allow you to mix and match flavors (braised beef, cheddar potato, spinach & ricotta, kraut & mushroom) and you can choose from a variety of fixings such as sour cream, caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and bacon (thankfully it comes with!). We ordered the cheddar potato and braised beef pierogies. The cheddar potato was perfect because it wasn't overly cheesy or salty. Flavor wise, I liked the braised beef, but it was slightly drier than I had hoped. It wasn't bad enough to warrant a lower rating. The pierogies were nicely prepared -- much better than those frozen ones I used to buy as a child from aisle 3 in the supermarket. Many cultures have a version of a dumpling, but these most reminded me of Chinese potstickers. Slightly crispy or firm on the outside and very moist and soft in the inside. The toppings all work whether individually or all together. They're not random; they show that thought was put into this. The sunny-side up eggs were nicely cooked; runny yolks are always a joy to eat. The kielbasa was tasty and I think it was pan-fried because it had a good crunch outside.Polak Eatery's decor is minimal. There is a mural presumably of Poland's landscape in fifty shades of gray (not the book, but the color). There is plenty of room to move around, but with limited seating. Having said that, I think they could probably squeeze in a couple more tables and chairs. So far, since the business is new, it was full, but not packed. Most lovely was the fact that the business owner, Damien, came by to greet my boyfriend and me as we ate. It always helps to have the owner come out and greet customers.

The pierogis just didn't taste savory and all the stuffing had about the same consistency. How is it that potato and cheese, and braised beef, and spinach all look the same consistency wise ?

We went in late Sunday morning for a \"mini-brunch.\" We weren't starving, but wanted a little nosh to hold through for a late lunch ahead. We decided to order four pierogies ($6) and a breakfast plate (two eggs, piece of kielbasa, two pierogies) ($6). For the pierogies, they allow you to mix and match flavors (braised beef, cheddar potato, spinach & ricotta, kraut & mushroom) and you can choose from a variety of fixings such as sour cream, caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and bacon (thankfully it comes with!). We ordered the cheddar potato and braised beef pierogies. The cheddar potato was perfect because it wasn't overly cheesy or salty. Flavor wise, I liked the braised beef, but it was slightly drier than I had hoped. It wasn't bad enough to warrant a lower rating. The pierogies were nicely prepared -- much better than those frozen ones I used to buy as a child from aisle 3 in the supermarket. Many cultures have a version of a dumpling, but these most reminded me of Chinese potstickers. Slightly crispy or firm on the outside and very moist and soft in the inside. The toppings all work whether individually or all together. They're not random; they show that thought was put into this. The sunny-side up eggs were nicely cooked; runny yolks are always a joy to eat. The kielbasa was tasty and I think it was pan-fried because it had a good crunch outside.Polak Eatery's decor is minimal. There is a mural presumably of Poland's landscape in fifty shades of gray (not the book, but the color). There is plenty of room to move around, but with limited seating. Having said that, I think they could probably squeeze in a couple more tables and chairs. So far, since the business is new, it was full, but not packed. Most lovely was the fact that the business owner, Damien, came by to greet my boyfriend and me as we ate. It always helps to have the owner come out and greet customers.

Ben was great to work with, from start to finish. Actually, I can't say that, because we're not finished, but... from start to mid point. =) I'll be coming back for more, don't worry. Anyway, we set up the initial consultation and I gave him my ideas, and we set a date some time in the future so I could save my pretty pennies for this piece. I am a woman with a budget, after all. Then, disaster struck, winter arrived and the annual furnace breakdown occurred. Ben was super understanding for my need to reschedule for, yet again, a date pretty far off in the future. By the time May rolled around, we had another consultation. For a minute I thought it had been so long that he had forgotten who I was and what I even wanted, but he had not! He even had my original pictures I had brought him 8 months earlier! We hammered out the details and I (impatiently) waited one week for the big day. \u00a0When I walked in the door, a walk in was going just ahead of me. Worry not, ladies and gents, because it was the fastest tattoo I've ever seen done, (and I assume it looked nice because the girl looked quite happy) and I was back in the chair in mere minutes. He showed me the amazing art he had drawn for my piece and I was blown away. Simply amazing. I'd show you a picture of it, but it's currently in that \"peely\" stage and I'm not going to let my skin healing mar Ben's reputation. Even in the state that it's in currently, (and also unfinished) I have gotten so many compliments on it.

I had the chance to \"people watch\" the other artists and customers for the 3.5 hours I was in the chair, and all the artists seemed like cool people who would be able to give you a piece you're proud of. I watched one guy, whose name I didn't catch, pretty much freehand the most realistic elephant I have ever seen in my life. \u00a0This isn't to say Ben's not much for conversation, but I'm a socially awkward gal and totally suck at small talk, so I chose to spend my time checking out the art that covers the walls and \u00a0taking a peek at what other people were getting done.

I'd been thinking about getting this tattoo for a couple of years. When I decided to pull the trigger I did research and chose Stephanie based on the praise for her script work. Since this was going to be my first tattoo, I didn't even care what Stephanie was like as a person-- just that she delivered on my vision. Turns out, she's friendly, down-to-earth AND a great artist. I emailed back-and-forth with her for quite some time and finally chose a date. She was courtious the entire time and super responsive. She even emailed me when she had a cancellation so I could come in early. When the date came I was pretty nervous, even thought about turning around and going home. But once I walked into Deluxe I knew I'd chosen the right place. The studio itself is large, open and has a lot of natural light. In not so many words, it's comfortable. There were quite a few customers already waiting at noon (always a good sign) but even so, I was greeted immediately and never left waiting. My tattoo itself is small and only took about 5-10 minutes to complete. Stephanie took nearly an hour with me though to get the font, placement and overall aesthetic correct. She worked on it until the font was as I'd hoped, then let me bounce back-and-forth between the mirror, the bathroom and my friend. She never acted impatient; on the contrary, she encouraged me to take a multitude of looks at different angles. Once I was committed to placement she got to work. She made conversation almost the whole time and I was super comfortable with her. She even started tattooing for just a few seconds to show me how it would feel (just like a lot of little pinches, as others have said). I smiled ear to ear when I saw the finished product. All said and done, I love what she designed, how she worked and how everyone else in the studio treated me.

Walking into the shop, you will find a clean and sanitary studio with artists abound. They are customer service oriented and ensure that their guests are taken care of from the original consult to after care.My artist is Jason Vaughn. He has an amazing talent in art and tattooing and uses it well, creating exactly what you ask for using vibrant colors and careful precision. He is a very quick tattoo-giver, so you won't be spending extra money due to time. Now...when I get a tattoo, I know that I'm going to have this piece of art on my person for the rest of my life, so I greatly appreciate when my artist says it's time to stop. Additionally, I also understand that as much as I'd love to have my friends and family come back and sit there while needles are piercing my skin applying ink, well, besides being boring, it can be distracting to both me and the artist. In addition to being a health code thing, I appreciate the enforcement at the shop This is not your \"run-of-the-mill\" tattoo studio. This place is for the person that seriously understands what getting a tattoo means to them.The music playlist can use a bit of a make-over, however...but I tend to bring a pair of headphones and zone out to my own tunes...So, if you're looking for an amazing looking tattoo, you've found the right place - and Jason is your artist.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 4]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Lakeview"], "latitude": 41.9541851, "longitude": -87.6663949, "rating": "5.0", "times": {"Mon": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Thu": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Sat": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Wed": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Tue": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Sun": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"], "Fri": ["12:00 pm", "8:00 pm"]}, "price": "$$", "categories": [["Tattoo", "tattoo"]], "address": ["1459 W Irving Park Rd"], "attributes": {"Parking": "Street", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "By Appointment Only": "No", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes"}, "category": "Beauty", "number_of_reviews": "333"}, "connection-salon-chicago": {"comments": {"58": {"description": "Juanita was amazing!

It's already hard enough to relax during a Brazilian so I definitely didn't appreciate the \"hmm, let's see... hold here... now maybe here... yup, don't move...\" instruction that went on during my entire appointment.

This woman tells me she will put this oil on my nails which will prevent them from smudging, even though they're dry anyway. NOPE. Ruined by the time I got home.

I've got ashy dark brown hair naturally and the top was completely left alone while the bottom was pretty much...purple.

Since their website was not updated for their March Specials, it would be best to call and ask as well as find out prices for add-ons, as well as the type of microdermabrasion utilized at salon.I got a call back from Juanita, who identifies herself as the Esthetician that does facials among other services. We get into a conversation that lasted about 20minutes. For some, this might be alot, for me, it wasnt. I talk alot, as well as ask ALOT of questions. She was very, very informative. She gave me different opinions based off verbal, she emphasized that of course, it would be best to look at my skin. I agree, she wasnt trying to upscale anything. In fact, as I made my appointnent, she saved me almost 50% because I was getting 2 services instead of getting a long facial and a microdermabrasion. I arrived 15minutes prior to my schedule time, to look around, some places have paperwork, so I always like to arrive early. I was greeted at the front desk by Alejandro (Salon's owner), he seated me promptly, as they went to get Juanita. Usually, I'm offered water or coffee but not at this salon. Alejandro's demeanor was okay, Smile more Alejandro, you have a GREAT salon!!Juanita came a few minutes later, big smile n hip looking glasses. I can tell I'm going to like this place. She has a good persona over the phone as well as in person. I get in, she explains what will happen. She excuses herself, while I take my blouse off and put on a towel with velcro on it. I get on table. She knocks and asks if Im ready and proceeds to come in.I wont bore you with each step....but she did the facial, prepped my skin for the microderm and has the best hands to massage my face, neck and shoulders. Once she finished facial, she did the Microderm, she used the diamond tip, which is new for me. Im used to the crystal/vacum type. I will say that i like the feel of the crystals better BUT the dimond tip can be used up close under my eyes whereas the crystals you cant. Also, with crystals I would be all red after and would notice the skin softness a day later whereas with diamond tip, I looked and felt my skin look hydrated, even tone and it even looked like i had makeup on when I didnt, and it didnt look red. The finishing mask was the weird one. She handed me a wand and told me that the wand and her touching my face woukd transmit a small amount of frequency, well for me it was too much. I did not like the little shocks on my skin, as she massaged this mask on me.... she said for some it was good but not me. I dont know if it was my anxiety or what, but i felt my heart race so I told her to turn off the wand. She was very attentive when the wand was on, to see my comfort level, when I told her it was not comfortable, she immediately turned it off and kept massaging me. She then put on a moisturizer spf 25 and hydrated my horribly cracked lips.Juanita, I can see why you are very popular among Yelp users and I am happy I found you. I feel so comfortable with her that, after she comes back from her break, I will letting her do my brazilian wax. Obviously, she has a good reputation on this as well and based on my comfort level, I have made this decison of entrusting her to see me lol. Yelpies, I recommend you take a look at their website, take advantage of First-time customer 20%off discount as well as call and speak to Juanita. Remember to SPEAK UP, if you have any allergies, are on certain meds, etc. Being a nurse, I am specific with anyone doing anything to my overall body, because I take medicine and becuz of my chronic back issues. I also told her about my sensitive skin and how I have to have everything frangrance free and senstive skin labels..... BUT in case you missed anything, Juanita asked me! So she is def. On her P's and Q's. :)For the Quick Fix Facial & Microdermabrasion as an Add On, my total was 65.00 + tax= $68.00!! Tipped her 15%.

They always give me extra bucks for buying stuff I had to buy anyway. Cool. But, the 24-hour CVS next to my apartment building is the worst, and I mean THE WORST, CVS. Actually, the worst drug/convenience/food store ever. I mean, you would think that living next to a 24-hour store of any kind would be awesome. Especially since they serve liquor until 2am, right? Of course not.I've lived in this neighborhood for 8 months now and I often frequent the store. I've seen them have one lane open on a weekend night with a cashier under 21, causing her to have to call an over-21 checker to make every alcohol sale. On a weekend night in my neighborhood, 85% of the people on line have some liquor in their hand ready to purchase.I've gone there for the most mundane of items, of which they are often out of stock Being hung-over, in your pajamas and having to get in your car to drive somewhere because the rat hole store next to you is out of half and half is irritating as hell. Well, I can imagine it would be anyway.Through those many, many, many, many times this store has been a disappointment, I always go back. I made so many excuses in my mind, like, lack of staff, the relatively new location, whatever. But, tonight, when this god forsaken CVS almost burned down my apartment and ruined my dinner, I realized it's the worst managed, worst serviced store in my experience with the chain. And I'm finally going to complain.All I wanted to do was get some diet Pepsi to go with my food. Just 1 bottle of pop, that's all. I thought, \"Why don't I go to the store that is across the street from my house\"? That's a normal thought process involving a normal neighborhood store. So I figured that my pasta sauce would be fine simmering on the stove for 5 or 10 minutes. The time it would take to walk back-and-forth from a normal store for such a normal sale.So it took me all of 30-45 seconds to walk in and grab my drink and head to the checkout. Well, there were 5 people in front of me. All obviously checking off their entire weekly shopping list by the amount of items in their carts and baskets. There was only one lane open. The manager was 'busy' stocking beer. Why in the world would the manager be stocking instead of opening another lane when there are that many customers? Do you know? If so, please enlighten me because I sure don't. Especially when I swear that the checker was so slow that I had read all about Britney's comeback before she started on the next customer. This customer has a LINK card, which doesn't work, so they have to spend a good 5 minutes on that. Now it's been 15 or so minutes, and I've still got 3 people in front of me. Now I start looking across the street at my kitchen window for any sign of flickering flames. I look forward and see she is still bagging the effing welfare recipient's items and I lost it. I marched back to the fridge, threw my pop inside and slammed the fridge door while muttering angry four letter words on my march to the front door. Running back to your apartment in frigid temperatures, through an icy alley, up frozen metal stairs to just be happy there's no smoke then to realize you have to now drink plain ass water with your pasta is beyond what this loquacious tirade can express.I'm done with this store.

When he told me the total of $20.83 I stated minus the $15.00, he said that was with the $15.00 deducted. I then asked him the prices of the items I ordered (1 lb. Jumbo Shrimp, Crab Salad and Calamari) He showed me the receipt. The prices were much higher than the menu prices online which are: 1 lb. Jumbo Shrimp - $16; Crab Salad - $3; Calamari - $6. I conveyed that to him and also retrieved their menu from my Samsung S4 and showed it to him. He then grabbed the receipt and balled it up. I asked him if had he a menu for the customers and after a bit of hesitation, he gave me the menu. After looking it over I saw the prices were pretty much the same as the online menu for the items I wanted - but he told me that the Calamari was actually $7.00. I went further to state to him that the menu's both in-store and online should convey correct information, because that is what the customer is expecting to pay upon arrival to your business. He seemed pretty shady and the co-workers looked that way as well. I told him no thanks and that I would report this situation, grabbed the menu he gave me and my certificate and left. Not a place I would recommend for doing business...I'd be uneasy about giving them my credit card to pay for my food.

Our mistake was taking the shrimp home and not eating them at the restaurant. But arctic cold has you doing some desperate things. At home, we opened the packaged shrimp. They were breaded and deveined perfectly. Not too thick of a breading, which I assume which was equivalent to a Panko crust. Tails were kept on, nicely seasoned but a great accomplice to the mango habanero sauce. This sauce was addicting! Great Merry and balance of sweet fruit and peppery heat. The spicy mayo was a close second in the sauce category, of this creamy and heat combination sauce. I personally didn't like the crab cake. It was lacking a sort of zest that was incorporated on the other food. I didn't find the sauce appealing either, maybe too much was drizzled on as a garnish. Hush puppies were standard. Get them.

I have been blowing glass for 5 years, and I am willing to make the trip up to Racine, WS to Hot Shop Glass instead of going to Chicago Hot Glass. To be honest, Chicago Hot Glass is a dump.Heating a glory hole can be complicated. It requires the proper ratio of gas to air, simply turning up both is not the solution. We had 2 staff members adjust our glory hole before the third person (the owner himself) was able to get it running properly. I had never had an issue with any the equipment at any of the other studios where I have worked. $40/hr is the cheapest you can rent for at Chicago Hot Glass, and that is for a 10\" glory hole. At Hot Shop Glass in Racine you get a 24\" glory hole for $35/HR. A 20\" glory hole would cost you $55/HR at Chicago hot glass. At the Urban Glass studio in NYC we paid $35/HR for a 10\" glory hole. The prices are not competitive.And the layout is terrible. You have to cross other work benches to get from the furnace to your glory hole. Your $40/HR becomes more like $55/HR when you consider all the wasted time.I met the owners and most of the staff at this place.

We came here for lunch after attending a community meeting not very far from this restaurant. I ordered a ropa vieja sandwich (sandwiches are only $5.95 and are huge), and my husband had a Cuban sandwich, while my niece had the same. The sandwiches do not come with anything. However, if you are really, really hungry order a few \"sides\" or appetizers. We also ordered croquettas de jamon, which were full of incredible sabor with a crispy exterior and tender interior. Excellent! We ordered a side of sweet plantains (generous portion for three people to share). They were perfectly ripe, tender, sweet with crispy edges. Awesomeness! \u00a0In addition, they served complimentary fresh, warm Cuban bread, buttered and grilled to a golden brown perfection. It was ethereal. We also had cafe con leche and guava pastelillos (guava pastry with a flaky, light, crispy exterior). I am rating this restaurant with 5-stars. Why? I came to the conclusion that they serve very, very authentic Cuban food. Yes, I know Cuban food, because I was born in Florida and we ate at many, many Cuban restaurants when we lived in Florida. The guava pastries here arrive fresh from a Cuban bakery in Miami, FL. They are super delicious with coffee or hot tea. They aren't super sweet either, and brought me back to my childhood when my Grandfather used to take us to his favorite Cuban bakery. My Grandfather would buy tons of guava pastelillos and other Cuban goodies and we would walk away with two or three boxes from the bakery. The truth is that I gave up sweets years ago, but this was one sweet that was tempting my taste buds. I gave into the temptation and broke down. OMG, I had one, and wow, it was ethereal.Stop going to 90-Miles, because this place is 100 times better. Better food. Better prices. Better service. Hey, stop reading this review and get your ass over to this place. Don't forget to hit the tall Conga (or tumbadora as the instrument is called in Cuba) on your way out of the restaurant (smack it super hard if you had a good time and enjoyed your experience). Twerk it up and down! This place is casual, small and service is always welcoming. This is a family-owned mom and pop restaurant with hard working people who take pride in providing quality hearty food. We got very lucky and found a parking spot in front of the restaurant (on a bitterly cold winter super-windy day). Our total came to $34 and change (excluding tip) -- considering everything that we ordered -- this was a very reasonable lunch.

Just saying! Additionally If you want some of those delicious Donut Vault Donuts get here early they sell out quickly.Two main issues I have with this joint. One is the lack of Donuts. They should have enough donuts to last a majority of the day and not just a few hours. Do they only expect five people to walk through that door? Just imagine the look on their faces when a soon-to-be fat guy whose metabolism is falling faster than Starlin Castro's batting average wants to order three of those things. Shock ensues! My other issue is why do they serve all coffee in to-go cups. Coffee should be in the typical ceramic mugs not paper to-go cups. The container in which a drink is served plays a huge part in a drinks appeal as well as the establishments. Just like certain type of cocktails belong in certain types of glasses, a cup of Joe belongs in a ceramic mug. I'm sure Mr. Sodikoff can find a garage sale and buy up a few throwback cups.Overall you can't beat the vibe and quality of C.C. Ferns.

Negatives: The three times I have visited the shop, everyone had been served their drink in a \u00a0to-go cup despite the fact that every customer was staying there to drink their beverage.

It is such a simple, beautiful shop without many items on the menu. Perfectly curated for high quality products with detail and care put into each. The one detail they missed, however, is their impact on the environment. It would be great to see all customers that are 'dining-in' to be served with washable, reusable glasses or mugs. If someone requests a to-go option, there are many materials that are more environmentally responsible available- plant-based, biodegradable cups for drinks both hot and cold. By serving dine-in customers with washable containers and carry-out drink orders with compostable cups, CC Ferns will completely alleviate the need to offer a recycling bin. And if they don't plan on making either change, a recycling bin is the responsible route.

Just saying! Additionally If you want some of those delicious Donut Vault Donuts get here early they sell out quickly.Two main issues I have with this joint. One is the lack of Donuts. They should have enough donuts to last a majority of the day and not just a few hours. Do they only expect five people to walk through that door? Just imagine the look on their faces when a soon-to-be fat guy whose metabolism is falling faster than Starlin Castro's batting average wants to order three of those things. Shock ensues! My other issue is why do they serve all coffee in to-go cups. Coffee should be in the typical ceramic mugs not paper to-go cups. The container in which a drink is served plays a huge part in a drinks appeal as well as the establishments. Just like certain type of cocktails belong in certain types of glasses, a cup of Joe belongs in a ceramic mug. I'm sure Mr. Sodikoff can find a garage sale and buy up a few throwback cups.Overall you can't beat the vibe and quality of C.C. Ferns. If you love no-nonsense coffee in a quiet relaxed atmosphere then there is no need to go elsewhere. Just be prepared to drink out of a paper cup and probably without a donut.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 22]}, "25": {"description": "Love this place!

I will warn you, I'm a vegetarian so this review is for my fellow vegetarian/vegan friends. In my opinion, Lockdown has the best veggie burger patties I've had in the city. They are made with sweet potatoes and are delicious and fresh. Some of the burger options work well with the veggie patty and my personal favorite is the Possession of Shrooms although the Hawaii 5-0 is also good minus the carnitas (this is vegan unless you add Swiss cheese, which I highly recommend). The sweet potato fries are bomb. I have had their regular fries which are also good, but I think it's criminal to order a burger and not get the sweet potato fries at least once. I go here about once a month, and pretty much always get those sweet potato fries. The poppy seed mustard/sauce that comes with them is also to die for. It's like crack. Perfectly compliments the fries and I always ask for more. I guess I'm just a sweet potato fiend. Give them to me in any form and I'm happy. As for other things, the drinks are decently priced. They have a $5 shot and beer combo, which I almost exclusively drink as it's a metal bar. Somehow that feels appropriate - don't ask me why. Speaking of metal, the place is loud as balls, but that's part of its charm. I would not suggest a first date here (one dude made that mistake, it was kinda funny for me being a semi-regular but I didn't have the heart to dissuade him) because you will be shouting over the Judas Priest or Ozzy or (fill in other metal band here) music videos. It certainly is entertaining to watch as you scarf down food and drink. Oh, and the mac and cheese is epic. $16 for a massive portion with two ingredients from their list. It sounds expensive but you won't regret it. So delicious. Obvi if you're vegan, that ain't for you, but you will still find things to eat.

She asked how much as on it ($50) but for no reason because she kept saying we couldn't do anything. Not a single effort was done. Fine, we were there and wanted to enjoy ourselves, which wasn't the best choice. \u00a0 At the end of our meal (3 of us prob there 40 min) we still had some of our drinks, half of our food and we're talking catching up and the whole crew made a very very very clear point they wanted us to leave. We were offered l by 2 diff crew members (including bus boy) containers and then the server didn't even ask she just brought us some. We were sitting there, with double the containers needed and it became obvious we had to hurry up and leave. \u00a0 \u00a0 They toke our plates , tried to clean around us, brought the check and didn't ask if we needed anything else .The bus boy kept standing near us, looking at us with a piercing look multiple times and even the server came by saying \"your still here?\" In a pretty rude way making us feel really unwanted specially because she didn't even ask if we needed anything else .  \u00a0 It was also odd because others were there before us and were still there , so I'm not sure if they were regulars as they seemed to be pretty chatty w the servers or if we were just targeted on being a mixed group. \u00a0Mind u that place was half empty by this time, there were plenty of open seats, tables, even at the bar,no one was waiting, no one seemed to be hustling, they just probably wanted to get things going. We were gonna order more drinks, but after an almost $100 bill, a rejected gift card \u00a0and a lack of good customer service, we were done spending our hard earned money there.

Out of respect to Lock down I will not mention them in this review, because through it all the staff was just about always on point with their service.

So let me start off by saying I'm a white gay professional guy in his mid-30's..well, late 30's but whatever. When I was in need of a quick cut I considered the PR barber shop that I pass on my way to work since it was a monday and most salons are closed. It's the kind of place with white walls, fluorescent lighting, a huge PR flag and a poster on the wall of a grid of hair cuts shown with numbers. I was pretty intimidated because being gay and having only gone to hair salons or at the very least a fancy barber shop I was a little scared I was going to walk out of there with a \"number 4\" a tight fade with lines in the side...After going in I soon realized that this is a great place with really talented barbers. I have never had so much time and effort put into a haircut..he used clippers, scissors, a straight razor, everything..I love it. Quick, great, and inexpensive..Joel is the guy I have gone to and he is really Awesome! I'm really glad I put aside my own dumb prejudices and preconceived notions what all these PR barber shops are like..it made me feel dumb.
