It is a two-step process, the two appointments are about one month apart. I am due for my second appointment this weekend at which time I plan to also get the eyeliner done. Lana is extremely professional - both with her communication via telephone/email while setting up the appointment, the office is clean and relaxing, and she wore a gown, mask, googles, and gloves during the entire procedure. She cleaned my entire face with alcohol before starting the procedure and I was impressed at how immaculate the whole set-up was. She even let me take videos while she was tattooing -- my friends were so curious how it's done, I wanted to have something to show them. Before even starting the tattoo process, Lana spent over two hours mixing pigments to find the perfect shade for my face. She was never rushed and often mixed and remixed, shaped then reshaped until she was satisfied we found the perfect color and shape for my face. I thought this was really nice, I appreciated that she took her time during the planning phase. Lana was conscious of the pain and made sure to numb the eyebrow area really well before diving into the bulk of the tattoo. She had two different types of numbing agents - one was a cream, the other was a spray. After she applied the cream, she waited a good 20-30 minutes until it kicked it fully. Then, she would work a little bit then spray the other numbing agent until I was totally numb. And I will say, after a couple applications of the cream and spray, I was totally numb and didn't feel anything. It was nice to not feel the tattoo on your face!My tattoos were tattooed in the past by another artist about 10 years ago so it was faded and misshapen. Lana evened them out to one another and corrected the color as well. I am really happy with the finished product, and am excited to see how they look after the second appointment.

She took the time to explain EVERYTHING! From start to finish,what to expect,not a detail was spared. Was it cheap? No. But this is my face we are talking about. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely. Her office is immaculate. She's even ambidextrous so she was able to draw brows with symmetry. My consultation with lana took longer than most places take to do brows from start to finish. Look at the before and afters on Lana website and see the amazing artwork she creates with her cosmetics. If you have less than stellar eyebrows, trust me there's someone out there that takes pride and can fix them for you.

It's pretty rare to find a Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant; I've seen maybe three or four in my life. But then again, it's not SO DIFFERENT from a Mom and Pop Indian restaurant, so there's nothing to really worry about -- you'll find a lot of the standard favorites. However... don't stop there. It's really worth exploring the menu. I'd start with their dumplings called Momos. They have a vegetarian version too and they're delicious; a little bit spicy; and a perfect way to start the meal. Also there are multiple types of bread, including Him's Bread which is far from commonly found as it contains raisins. I order that and Garlic Naan and usually take about half of each order home with me as it reheats well.This place doesn't skimp on quality. They use mahi mahi for the fish and don't even bother saying that on the menu. It's this kind of attitude of honesty and integrity that makes it always a pleasure to meet the people who run this restaurant. They are so kind. Perhaps some Americans are not accustomed to the quiet reserve of their demeanor. They are genuine and helpful, always ready to make the customer happy. I've been here many times and it seems the patrons are hardly ever new customers; but when I bring new people with me, they always remark about how much they like it. Another thing I like about this place is that even if you order the \"standard Indian food\" you may be surprised that it's spiced a little mellower, or with slightly different touches, due to the different geography/ethnicity. It's \"their\" version of that dish. So the variation is like hearing a live version of a song you already know the regular recording. It's almost the same, but different, and that makes you appreciate both.It's BYOB so there's savings there. They have excellent chai tea and an array of cans of soft drinks. Don't expect some vast variety of foreign soda pop.Sure this place could be fancier. But that's not what they're all about. I think they have been in business a couple years now and seem to be getting better and better with handling customer demands.

Ever since friends introduced my husband and I to this jewel a year ago, we have not gotten Nepalese or Indian food from any other restaurant in Chicago- that's how good Himshikar is!If you've never had Himalayan/ Nepalese food before, it is similar to Indian food with many curries, vegetarian, and spicy dishes (don't worry, you can request to adjust the spice level to your taste), but there are differences that make the cuisine uniquely Himalayan. I highly recommend the veggie momos. They are similar to pot stickers, but a bit thicker and tastier. I adore all of their spinach dishes and haven't had a curry dish I didn't like yet. The tikka masala is phenomenal- I could practically drink the sauce by itself. Garlic naan is the way to go, but the traditional naan is fantastic, too. \u00a0Portion sizes are perfect, ample to share with a friend, but also good for dining solo and having leftovers for later. The restaurant itself is not a looker, but who cares when the food is so good?! In my travels, \u00a0the most humble- looking restaurants have served some of my most memorable meals. What the restaurant lacks in decor is made up \u00a0by the excellent service. The owner himself is often our waiter and is always quick to refill our tea and see how we're doing. \u00a0Delivery service is speedy in my neighborhood (near Albany Park). I typically receive my food well within an hour and it's always piping hot. Unlike other reviews, I've never experienced any issues with freshness or upset stomachs and I've eaten here almost monthly for the past year. I am lactose-intolerant, so I just pop a Lactaid (as I do any time I eat dairy-filled dishes) before indulging \u00a0and am totally fine. Also, I wonder if the other reviewers were expecting Indian food. This is a Nepalese restaurant, so while the cuisines are similar, there are differences, which is part of what makes Himshikar so special. Overall, Himshikar is worth every bit of 5 stars.

It's pretty rare to find a Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant; I've seen maybe three or four in my life. But then again, it's not SO DIFFERENT from a Mom and Pop Indian restaurant, so there's nothing to really worry about -- you'll find a lot of the standard favorites. However... don't stop there. It's really worth exploring the menu. I'd start with their dumplings called Momos. They have a vegetarian version too and they're delicious; a little bit spicy; and a perfect way to start the meal. Also there are multiple types of bread, including Him's Bread which is far from commonly found as it contains raisins. I order that and Garlic Naan and usually take about half of each order home with me as it reheats well.This place doesn't skimp on quality. They use mahi mahi for the fish and don't even bother saying that on the menu. It's this kind of attitude of honesty and integrity that makes it always a pleasure to meet the people who run this restaurant. They are so kind. Perhaps some Americans are not accustomed to the quiet reserve of their demeanor. They are genuine and helpful, always ready to make the customer happy. I've been here many times and it seems the patrons are hardly ever new customers; but when I bring new people with me, they always remark about how much they like it. Another thing I like about this place is that even if you order the \"standard Indian food\" you may be surprised that it's spiced a little mellower, or with slightly different touches, due to the different geography/ethnicity. It's \"their\" version of that dish. So the variation is like hearing a live version of a song you already know the regular recording. It's almost the same, but different, and that makes you appreciate both.It's BYOB so there's savings there. They have excellent chai tea and an array of cans of soft drinks. Don't expect some vast variety of foreign soda pop.Sure this place could be fancier. But that's not what they're all about.

If you go Monday - Wednesday they have a mani-pedi special. In addition, it is a great place to throw a party. I did one over the summer. They accommodated all of my friends and even let us bring alcohol. They were great with me as we will celebrating my birthday that they split who I sat with for my mani and pedi so I got to rotate and talk to everyone.

I am willing to pay and travel for good service and cleanliness. I also want to be able to communicate with the technician who is doing my nails. I was looking to get my nails done before a weekend trip and wanted a place that was closer than my previous go-to suburban salon. I checked Yelp reviews, and chose Deluxe Nails based on the rating and comments. I have been to Deluxe Nails twice now, and had an excellent experience with Jenny both times, it definitely lived up to my expectations!Jenny has given me probably the best no-chip manicures I've had. Many salons charge a lot more than Deluxe Nails and do a \"dry\" no-chip manicure, which basically involves pushing back your cuticles without any softening, clipping/filing/shaping, applying the polish, and then applying lotion. Not at Deluxe Nails! It is a full-blown manicure - soak, cuticle removal, shaping, an outstanding and careful application of the no-chip polish with ample curing time, topped off with a neck and shoulder massage. I have selected CND Shellac polish both times (my preferred brand) and have had perfect nails with no chips for 3+ weeks. They have quite a few colors and brands of no-chip polish.The pedicure is nice, their spa massage chairs really give you a going over! I need to spend some time checking out the different massage features, the first time I felt a bit manhandled by the chair's default setting, but not in a bad way. They go beyond the basics on the pedicure as well.They sanitize their tools and pedicure bowls well, and use disposable files, buffers, and whatever the little bars are called that they use to exfoliate your feet. Each station has multiple fresh items ready for the technicians to use.The decor is not fancy, more functional, which is fine with me. I appreciate the outstanding service and result for what I consider a very fair price - 40% less than what I was paying at the salon where I have my hair done.Their closing time is earlier than what is listed on the Yelp page - I felt bad because they stayed late to finish for me because I went in assuming they were open until 7:30 but discovered that they close at 7 on weeknights, at least during the winter.

My friend runs up there asking again did you find a set of car keys?

My friend grabs them and gives them to me.The ENTIRE staff knew they were my keys. I was making a huge scene about it the entire time, asking everyone if they have seen them. You may think, oh maybe they didnt know the keys were yours. They all knew they were, EVERYONE even the customers knew they were. The customers were 10 million times more helpful than the staff.

They go deep down and find the root of the problem, then attack it head on. \u00a0I also find them to be quite entertaining! Then after my muscles are relaxed Dr. D (the coolest chiropractor in the world) sets everything back into place. I won't lie, I'm usually super sore the day after. But in truth this place has made a HUGE difference for me. I always feel great afterwards and they really do make my pain go away. Aside from their excellent services and know-how, I have to say my favorite thing about this place is the people. EVERYONE is super nice and friendly. Always with a smile, a joke and a story. It's a really inviting atmosphere and it seems to me that they really love what they do.

My latest injury is an angry calf muscle caused by getting wrapped up in my sheets and falling out of bed. Yup. I knew after it wasn't healed after a few weeks that I'd need to reach out and get some medical attention. As I didn't want drugs to mask the pain and wasn't quite sure if I was up to physical therapy yet, I sought out someone I knew would help me on the way to healing. Enter Sauganash Wellness Center and its incredible staff to the rescue (again). Deanna looked me over, confirmed that I was an idiot (actually she just laughed with me), gave me an amazing Chiropractic adjustment and then sent me off for a massage to help my poor sore muscles. After my half- painful, half- wonderful massage, she created art on my calf with some Kineseo Tape. I left feeling sore in a good way, versus the aching sore I'd been feeling for weeks.

This is clearly Chinese Fast Food. If you were ordering from here to expect something authentic, then it would come as no surprise to me that you were let down. I believe I am a food addict. I try not to discriminate. Hunan Spring leaves me with mixed feelings.First of all, The restaurant seems family owned. Anyone who feels like they have received bad service from this place is right to do so. To be empathetic, I would say that the employees you see working the register or delivering your food are probably not paid what they're worth. I could expand here, but at the risk of anyone thinking that I am forming stereotypes, I am going to leave it alone. The rest of the reviews on here pretty much back up my observations anyway.Aside from what anyone else says, it's decent food. I even think their egg rolls are decent. I've had the following: Shrimp in lobster sauce, sesame chicken, chicken wings, fried squid, Cashew Chicken, and crab rangoon. All of it is decent except for the sesame chicken. It's practically all breading, and it tastes like the orange chicken from Panda Express. The chicken wings, which I had hoped would arrive in a spicy sauce, were just friend chicken wings. Don't bother. The fried squid is my favorite. I think most people might find it gross though. If you have it delivered, then you need to take it out of the box right away. Leaving it in the container will allow it to get soggy. Seriously, open it up as soon as you close the door on the delivery guy/girl. The squid comes with this awesome sweet and spicy sauce that rivals any sweet and sour sauce. I'd almost make the clerks give you a container of that for your egg rolls. If you pick up your order of squid from the restaurant right as it comes out of the kitchen, and you rush it home, it's even crispier.I am pretty relaxed when it comes to these things, but I have to keep it real: One time I did find a thick black hair in my food. I really think the guys in the kitchen are way too comfortable because they are working for family and they don't have to worry about losing their jobs; which probably makes up for the lack of pay. I've even seen the cooks working the kitchen with their street jackets on because there was obviously no heat turned on in the restaurant.

It was a little strange that there were very few 2-seater tables. \u00a0With a reservation, we got put in the back of the room right next to the kitchen (which could be due to using a Groupon, but probably more to the fact that they seem to cater to families and groups) There were no more than 3 happy birthday opera sing-alongs in the dining room. \u00a0Of the food, I can give high ratings to the warm loaf of bread they bring to the table, the mini arancini appetizer, and my entree, a spinach and ricotta ravioli with meat sauce, which the restaurant host insisted the chefs were frantically preparing from scratch earlier in the day. \u00a0My boyfriend's minestrone soup was good as well. \u00a0The red sauce was decent, although nothing to write home about.The cons: Our server made a couple of major faux pas - bringing our entree while completely forgetting to bring out our soup and salad, and bringing me the wrong entree. \u00a0(To be fair, she claimed to be new, but still).

Over the years they offered standard Italian fare which was unremarkable but tasty enough. The oldie ambience was nice and the service was fine. ... Until this week. Recently Montastaros started offering $10.00 Tuesday Pasta nights, when customers could order pasta off the regular menu for $10.00 (for a \u00a0$16.00-$20.00 pasta dish). Six of us friends went together and most of us ordered pasta dishes from the regular menu, for the discounted price of $10.00. When the food arrived, two of us, who had ordered the same dish, found it to be tasteless and overcooked. The waitress called the manager to our table when we told her we were not happy with our food. The manager informed us that she was the owner's wife and said, \"What can you expect for $10.00???!!!! \"I will get you something else.\" One of us said to remove the food and said that he did not want anything else. I said that I did not like the food but I would eat it anyway. (I was not willing to wait another 20 minutes for a new dish.) Lo and behold-15 minutes later a freshly cooked preparation of the same dish was brought to my friend although he had not asked for it. But he was hungry, and decided to eat it anyway. It was nicely prepared and tasted nothing like the first one brought to us. IN ADDITION - Two people ordered lamb chops from the regular, non discounted menu and after waiting a long time the waitress told us they just ran out of the last 2 lamb chops. When we questioned the Owners Wife about why they ran out of food at 6:00pm when there were only 3 tables of people in the restaurant she told us they had run out the day before. WHY was the staff not informed so they could tell their customers at the time they tried to order? \u00a0WHY did the Owners Wife charge my friend for the dish he said he did not want? (Yes, he ate it, but that is not the point. \u00a0That dish should have been \"comped\"). \u00a0But the damage was done due to the Extreme Rudness on the part of the Owner's Wife who implied that customers should expectlesser quality food if they take advantage of Monostaros promotions.To Owner's Wife- A RecipeIngredients1 Apology1 question about what can be done for the customer2 fresh dishes, comped3 waitstaff with knowledge of what the kitchen is out of1 smileDirectionsCombine ingredients.
