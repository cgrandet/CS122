That's kind of bullshit. The stuff that's not on sale is crazy expensive. Avoid any paper goods, cleaning solutions and pet food here. They are Beverly Hills priced. I guess they have to make up the difference somewhere. Now for the bad stuff....EVERYONE in the parking lot is either blind, zombies, senile, or stupid. No one here knows how to drive, or knows what one way is. Then in the store, they are completely oblivious to everyone. They don't move, block aisles(which is EASY to do), and even bump their carts into you. They are of carnival-folk-like hygiene and demeanor. I haven't noticed sanitation, probably because I didn't WANT to notice. I'm sure their deli has made many sick. Not so much because of bad meat, but the fact that they don't seem to wipe the slicers during use. Maybe just at the end of the day? I've never had a problem with the cashiers. They always say hi and are always very nice. And I'm not that young or good looking, so I don't know why they do. Fresh bakery too , which is awesome.

The old steamtable in the middle of the dining room held pork ribs (boiled, with a little BBQ sauce brushed on top), breaded chicken thighs and drumsticks, pork stew/\"goulash,\" breaded boneless pork chop, sliced pork loin in gravy, boiled potatoes with parsley, meatballs in a creamy dill sauce, stuffed cabbage, green beans, blintzes, saurkraut, kielbasa, dumplings, and 3 kinds of pierogis. \u00a0Plus there was another large bar with a bunch of prepared cold salads. Oh, and two soups, chicken noodle and barley. And pieces of ham and beef under foil on a carving station (which I didn't try because they looked a little dry).The barley soup was extraordinary -- creamy, deeply flavored, and comforting -- a masterful rendition, obviously made from scratch, of a classic Polish American specialty. It had bits of dried mushroom, diced potato, bay leaf, allspice, finely shredded carrot, likely a little sour cream. \u00a0It was just a little too salty. \u00a0The breaded chicken pieces were really flavorful and good, the way chicken SHOULD taste, as were the plump pierogi filled with spiced ground meat. \u00a0Everything else was typical of places like Sawa's or Bobak's (or the late, lamented Tatra Inn on Pulaski) -- somewhat heavy, much of it sitting in too much butter/ oil -- but still, you got the impression it was all prepared with care and a deep sense of Polish American tradition. More importantly, everything I sampled was tasty. There was no pizza, mac and cheese, or ersatz Mexican like you find on the local Chinese buffet troughs; no awkward concessions to the changing neighborhood (Bobak's is now making chorizo). \u00a0I'm sure everyone in the kitchen is Polish, and it's Polish food you come here to eat. I had been wary of trying this place based on the earlier reviews. \u00a0Don't know if it would be as good on weekdays or off hours. It's one of those places that's rapidly becoming a little corner of the world that time forgot. \u00a0The decor is old fashioned, and the plates are this old Homer Laughlin variety -- commercial-heavy, off white, with a curvy gold pattern around the rim; check the photo I've posted -- that it seems like every \"nice\" restaurant on the South Side and south burbs had back in the 70s. \u00a0The clientele (and there wasn't much business for the large dining room; three or four tables) is older. \u00a0I suspect a lot of bachelors and widowers eat here. \u00a0There was, though, a larger gathering in the adjacent private room -- middle-aged and elderly, white haired Polish folks, the older men wearing what looked like suits and polyester ties they had purchased at the Ford City J.C. Penney back in 1979 but which they still wore with care and pride. \u00a0One old rooster was sporting what was apparently an old Polish military uniform.Sunday Buffet was $13. \u00a0Surprisingly, I found a $5 check-in offer on Foursquare for using AMEX. \u00a0I couldn't have imagined anyone at this place would know about Foursquare, and I had even wondered if they took credit cards. But I have to say, this was a delicious and satisfying (and, if you grew up in this area, nostalgic) meal. The place may look a little tired, but the food didn't reflect that. \u00a0You come here if you want authentic, stick-to-your-ribs, east European home cooking of the kind it's increasingly difficult to find.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 3, 4]}, "15": {"description": "For what it is, it works.

I ordered a 2 tacos, one with chorizo and the other with chicharro. Both were really delicious and very similar to a street taco. I also had a tamal with cheese and pepper strips which was also good.

I'm truly disappointed in my pizza, the one employee in the place, and the cleanliness.I called in advance to order a large thin crust ham and mushroom pizza. While on the phone with the employee trying to place the order he had me repeat my order three times. And twice during the call he asked if I was ordering a pizza from Giorginos or Giordanos. Really? How many people make that mistake that you then need to make every customer who calls to feel like an idiot?When I arrived in the quoted 25 minutes there were two customers in front of me waiting while just one employee ran crazy around the kitchen preparing different things. While I waited I took note of a few things. First was that all the lights in the place were off except for the kitchen. It was dinner time, not a slow period in between lunch and dinner. Next was the cleanliness of the kitchen. I wouldn't even call it a level of cleanliness but a mass of filth. Food sitting open like Italian beef, some ground beef or burgers, and what looked like a bag of shredded white cheese - all things that need to be kept refrigerated. And then I watched the employee go from handling money to open food without washing his hands or putting on gloves. Now let me talk about the thin crust pizza. Not so thin. The crust was more like a hand tossed Pizza Hut or Papa John's crust. There was an ample amount of sauce and cheese. The ham was OK but really didn't have much taste. Then we get to the mushrooms... I've never had anything other than fresh mushrooms on a pizza. These mushrooms were the kind that come in a can and are smaller \"Pieces and Stems\" and were quite mushy. Last time I looked the fresh mushrooms were a lot less expensive than canned stems. It took the flavor and texture of the pizza right down. So the only slightly good aspect I can mention here is that the Family Dollar allows Giorginos customers to park in their lot. I can't honestly see a reason to try this place again.

The Korean bbq steak in the taco could have been marinated with the sauce before grilling instead of tossing the meat in the sauce after it was cooked which made the sauce taste like an afterthought. The pickled onions on the taco were a nice touch though.

Apparently, Andrisi's is the middle man for a big box Chicago based food vendor (just my opinion). and not made in-house.The bread is good, the sweet peppers are cooked appropriately however the juice is as salty as the ocean.

Their chilli is still good but the beef is dry and flavorless. They used to have a big poster touting Vienna beef products but it's no longer hanging there and sadly I believe they no longer use the quality Vienna products of the past. Rick is the latest owner. Rick, I've loved eating at Parisi's for 30 years, but the quality of the aforementioned products has really gone downhill. The hot dogs are no longer red as in red hots, but now a dismal beige grey. \u00a0 The 2 mopes you have working there, especially \u00a0when your not there, are going to ruin your business. They screw up orders left and right, leaving off toppings requested, adding toppings not requested.

This time was our first visit this year and I'm not including the good and bad visits we had in years past as we need to focus on their current quality and service. We had an awful small cheese fry order! Less than 20 total fries and cold solidified cheese. We popped the cheese in the microwave for 20 seconds and ended up with the same cold solid cheese encased by a melted plastic cheese cup. Disgusting. The Italian Beef with red sauce and sweet peppers had tasteless beef and the cheese burger was just a 1/8th lb patty (weight not listed anywhere on paper or board menus) that was much too flat and over cooked. Our meal was useless. The guy handling the food without gloves (as many cooks or chefs would if ONLY handling food) was also the guy who took our money and gave us change. Imagine the germ transfer to the food. A huge city health code violation. Their order window is OK but the pick up window sucks where they don't call a number or your name, just one food item from the order and hope no one else waiting ordered the same thing. This hasn't changed for years and is logistically ridiculous in my opinion. I've seen many people pay and leave with the wrong order.

My coffee went empty and we waited quite awhile while our waitress stood behind the counter and stared off into space. \u00a0Finally a different waitress came by and filled our coffee. \u00a0My neighbor was dining in there and was seated in the booth next to us. \u00a0He ordered the 1lb bacon BLT. It looked great but he informed us that it didn't have any mayo on it and was sort of dry because of that. My wife ordered the same and loved the sandwich, \u00a0however, \u00a0she had to ask for mayo as well. I've never heard of a BLT not having mayo BUT if you're going to serve one without it, \u00a0you need to inform your customers and ask them if they want it because most people expect it. My son ordered the bacon waffle but we didn't see any bacon in the waffle and he ordered praline bacon but was brought regular bacon. \u00a0When we inquired with the waitress she said that she never heard of it. We informed her it was on the top of the sides menu. \u00a0She went and retrieved a menu and brought it to the table, I assumed to show us that we were wrong but sure enough it was right at the top. She went and checked in the kitchen and informed us it would be a 15 minute wait. \u00a0The good thing was that she apologized profusely and did not charge us for our son's order of bacon. If you want 5 stars, \u00a0you have to train your servers better.

Our 2nd visit was disastrous and is the reason we won't be back. The whole time we were there for breakfast, there were only 3 other occupied booths, so not very busy. Waitress was nice & we placed our orders, a Cafe Renee skillet & an order of biscuits and gravy. We waited about 15 minutes & the waitress brings out the biscuits & gravy. She apologizes for not bringing out my skillet but says she didn't want the hubby's biscuits to get cold. He starts digging in while I watch him eat & immediately see a look of disgust come across his face. The biscuits were still frozen! Strike 1!Waitress comes around with my skillet & \"toast\". When it's white & soft it's not toast, it's just white bread. Didn't say anything because well, it's just bread. Waitress apologizes because it took so long to get my food and says the chef made it with egg whites the first time so she made him redo it. Honestly I would've been fine with the egg whites if that meant actually eating together with my hubby. Hubby does tell the waitress about the frozen biscuits & she apologizes & says she will make chef make it again from scratch. Ok...so now I'm eating & he's just watching me eat. As I look down into my skillet there's exactly 1 slice of unmelted Kraft cheese. I realize this isn't a fancy place but really!? Not even real cheddar cheese? And it's not even melted! Strike 2!Alright whatever I'll just mix it together & make it melt myself. I pick up my first bite of food & what is on it??? A hair! Alright, clearly we're not meant to enjoy our breakfast today. Strike 3! Waitress comes around with the \"redone from scratch\" biscuits. Finally, we get to eat together! Nope! Hubby takes 2 bites and he's done. Biscuits were the same ones just reheated in the microwave making them mushy and you could just taste the freezer burn. Completely inedible. Bleh! Strike 4! We pretty much gave up & didn't say anything anymore. I don't know if the chef was just having a really bad day because some items from the other tables also got returned. Another patron did complain about the toast & another table also got their order wrong and returned it. I'm really not sure what happened between the first time we were here and today, our second visit. Waitress did come around with a small free orange juice for the inconvenience, but I don't think anything could've made up for today's breakfast disaster.

So for ~$12, each person had soup, salad, pasta or potato, and HUGE portions of their dinner entrees. Hands down the best minnestrone ever, cooked with homemade rendered stock and full of amore. So well-seasoned. Salads are iceberg lettuce, but the house vinaigrette is decent. Good homemade bread served with whipped butter. I had chicken cacciatore, which came filling an entire plate with two full chicken breasts and sauce (I usually only eat 1/2 chicken breast at a time, so this is meals for days!). It was rich, briny (love the capers), but not too heavy. Orange roughy with lemon butter was decent (sauce better than the fish), crusted red snapper special also good. One of the highlights the red sauce on the pasta -- heavenly and so fresh. Amazing bread pudding, custardy and just the right balance of cinnamon. Bar is separate from dining area, which looks like a family-style restaurant with booths and tables inside (not what you expect from the outside). The decor is dated, but it kind of adds to the charm of feeling like you're in your friend's Italian grandmother's home having a great meal. Authentic and unpretentious. This is the food of generations -- you can almost hear the years of family celebrations singing through it. There is a wonderful In Memoriam to the original Vince and his wife from decades ago.

Secondly the sauce is poured over the top sandwiching the ingredients between the dough. Lastly the crust of this \"pizza\" resembles that of the crust of a pie. Not in flakiness, but in tastes...

Then I forgot that I was still in the Midwest where-- if judged solely by this place-- \"healthy\" means doughy cheese pizza and butter- and cheese-laden sandwiches and salads.I wanted the Children's Combo for my six-year-old (advertised in no less than four places within this tiny caf\u00e9). At first, the woman at the counter knew nothing of this Children's Combo and then declared that it was not available, no more were left (?) although all the components of the Combo (sandwich, fruit, milk) were available and visible to me and the two other parents in line who also wanted to order it.Flight boarding soon, options scarce...So, my child ended up with a disgusting slice of nutritionally suspicious cheese pizza and I purchased a ten-buck \"Garbage Salad\" which looked innocent in its plastic bowl, until I sat down and opened the lid. It had easily a half-pound of ham and salami in it. More fatty meat than lettuce, people. And I don't eat red meat. Is \"Garbage Salad\" a regional thing, that every Chicagoan knows? Because nowhere was this salad written up or described for unsuspecting travelers who may not have the x-ray vision to see through the pile of croutons (see-- croutons... healthy?) underneath the lid.Get me out of here.There's no place like PDX, there's no place like PDX. *clicking heels*", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 7, 20]}, "5": {"description": "Avoid at all costs.
