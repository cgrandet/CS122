I was starving and on high alert for my food and no bells or phone calls were missed. After going back and forth it was discovered that the driver actually called the wrong number multiple times even though the correct number was in the delivery instructions. At this point the women offers no apology and has an attitude and says do u want your food or not. It was 10:40pm, I placed my order at 8:20. Of course I want my food cause everyone else was closed and I was hungry. (Hints why I ordered food in the first place) the women offered no compensation and still no apology. The 2nd driver comes to deliver the food. He calls the correct number and tells my boyfriend to come to his car....... Excuse me. Why would anyone walk outside of their home to a car to pick up food. So my boyfriends tells him that he will meet him at the door. The driver then starts to holler at him until finally my boyfriend says \"look Im coming downstairs to the door and u have to walk to the door and that's the end of it\". I look out the window to see the driver has parked down the street (even thought there was a park in front) he walks up and doesn't look at the address and proceeds to turn around back to the car. Since I was looking out the window I jollared out to tell him the right door. He then has a complete attitude with my boyfriend and tells him well next time don't order. Is that how I should be treated over some food that I already paid for by credit card over the food. Simply terrible service.

There's some outdoor seating available or you can take it with you, but be sure to bring cash- I'm not a fan of cash-only businesses, but at least there's an ATM here.SMELTS: Grab a half order, available with a spicy or mild dipping sauce not unlike a buffalo wing sauce. They're hot and crispy, and plenty for sharing even with the half order. But I'd take these to go and make a garlic sauce to serve them with, as done in European cuisine.GARLIC PEPPER SMOKED SALMON: This was tasty, and by far the most recommended fish in the reviews. It was good, but not amazing. If your only knowledge of smoked fish is the lox on your bagel at a chain restaurant, you might really like this massive step up in quality.SMOKED TROUT: Go classic. The smoked trout is divine. No pepper or garlic needed, just simple, smoked fish. It's flavorful, with plenty of skin, and I could eat it for days.CRACKERS: Whatever you buy, grab a tube of crackers (they're 55 cents) to eat your fish with. \u00a0And don't forget to grab napkins, because you'll be eating all this tastiness with your hands.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 17]}, "39": {"description": "great fesh fish no dine in but a chicago nessitity", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 22]}, "37": {"description": "I've been wanting to check out Calumet Fisheries FOREVER, so I was pretty excited to finally swing by! \u00a0This smokehouse has been family-owned and -operated by the Kotlick-Toll family since '48, where the fish is brined overnight and special oak logs are used for the smoking. \u00a0Fish, such as catfish, chubs, eel, rainbow trout, sable, salmon, sturgeon, white fish, and herring are some that are available. \u00a0They also have fried seafood (shrimp, fish, catfish, scallops, and crab cakes), as well as sides and salads. \u00a0I tried their Pepper & Garlic smoked salmon, a half order of the fried shrimp, and a half order of their fried smelts. \u00a0The smoked salmon was pretty good; just use a strong fork to flake it apart; they have packages of saltine crackers available, but you can bring you own. \u00a0It had a lovely smoked flavor, and the garlic and the peppercorn was not too overpowering. \u00a0Just having the fish with the crackers can be a little dry, so having some mayonnaise to spruce it up is a good idea. \u00a0The fried shrimp was forgettable, and the fried smelts were okay - the batter was more like ground cornmeal-like, rather than the crispy batter I was expecting. \u00a0Service was super friendly, and everything is made fresh-to-order (besides the smoked fish). \u00a0This is a cash only joint, so keep that in mind. \u00a0It is a carry-out only, but there are a couple of picnic tables in the front to enjoy your meal (I prefer to just chowing down in the car - that's how you do ittttttt) :P \u00a0I'd love to come back and try out their smoked sable, sturgeon, and the trout :D+Pepper & Garlic smoked salmon+friendly staff+cash only", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 8, 9]}, "0": {"description": "Fantastic divey little fish stand on the far south side.

A thing to note is that they don't have lemons (sigh) and they don't sell beer (double sigh). Lucky for us we had packed some brewskis. We set up food camp on the table and dug in.

Prices can be a bit pricey at $15 per lb for smoked salmon & $22 per lb for smoked shrimp, but it was definitely worth it. The flavors were on point. It was the best smoked fish I have ever had. The shrimp was just amazing! You can truly taste the true flavor of the shrimp. You can even smell the smoke from the shrimp. They do not have cocktail sauce.

I'm sure their fried fish is fine, and the smelts we tried were tasty, but the smoked fish was by far the star of our meal. They sell by weight, so come hungry and plan to buy a couple of pounds to split with a group. There's some outdoor seating available or you can take it with you, but be sure to bring cash- I'm not a fan of cash-only businesses, but at least there's an ATM here.SMELTS: Grab a half order, available with a spicy or mild dipping sauce not unlike a buffalo wing sauce. They're hot and crispy, and plenty for sharing even with the half order. But I'd take these to go and make a garlic sauce to serve them with, as done in European cuisine.GARLIC PEPPER SMOKED SALMON: This was tasty, and by far the most recommended fish in the reviews. It was good, but not amazing. If your only knowledge of smoked fish is the lox on your bagel at a chain restaurant, you might really like this massive step up in quality.SMOKED TROUT: Go classic. The smoked trout is divine. No pepper or garlic needed, just simple, smoked fish. It's flavorful, with plenty of skin, and I could eat it for days.CRACKERS: Whatever you buy, grab a tube of crackers (they're 55 cents) to eat your fish with. \u00a0And don't forget to grab napkins, because you'll be eating all this tastiness with your hands.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 17]}, "2": {"description": "I watched Anthony Bourdain chow down on some seafood here and then found myself in Chicago for a wedding a couple of weeks later.

It turns out that my Southside mother (88th and Mackinaw then Lansing) used to go to this very same place on Fridays in the 1950s when the restaurant served shrimp in Chinese take-out cartons whose sides would become so greasy that people could see through them! Sixty years later on 5/29/2015 my mother ordered the shrimp dinner, which comes with slaw. According to her, the shrimp still have the same coating as back in the '50s! My fiancee and I ordered a large fry (nice thick square-cut fries served in a huge old-fashioned red and white paper ground-beef tray), the smoked trout, smoked salmon with pepper and garlic, and the normal smoked salmon, to which an employee said, \"There's nothing normal around here.\" :-) The salmon just came out of the smoker and had a pleasant oily and tender texture that lacked any trace of smokey flavor. The trout was fine. All three orders of fish came in triple-wrapped white paper, which adds to the great old-fashioned touch. The slaw was nice and tangy. The fries had a full and slightly oily favor that complemented the fish. Overall, there's nothing to criticize! Just enjoy this time-tested Southside treasure of great fishy goodness, especially if are a Chicagoan! Support the local economy, damn it!! PS Tip 1: Some people may be a bit apprehensive about the neighborhood, but they shouldn't worry too much. Just take the Bishop Ford to the Stoney Exit, which takes you on a very long exit ramp that deposits you at about 97th and Stoney. Go a couple blocks north to 95th, make a right, and go 2 short miles to Calumet Fisheries. Tip 2: We completed our Southeast-side tour by eating at some picnic tables at the William Powers State Recreation Area at 126th and Ave. O in the lesser-known Chicago neighborhood Hegewisch.

I had carne asada tacos, and they instantly became the best steak tacos Ive had around a 50 mile radius (with the exception of the steak tacos in Harry's Long Bar in Blue Island, which are just as good as these). The meat is cooked to perfection, and it is some of the most flavorful, juicy, no nerves beef Ive ever tasted. This is something I cant describe, its something you have to try for yourself. Since then Ive had the following: milanesa torta, (is good), the enchiladas (are ok), the al pastor tacos (are ok) and the chicken flauta dinner, which is delicious because the beans and rice are good, and the flautas are generous and they dont scrimp on toppings, they pile on the sour cream, garnishing cheese and avocado on top. A big plus is that they provide you with lots of pickled carrots n peppers as well as grilled cebollitas or scallions, and the latter is something all other restaurants charge separately for. People think that Pilsen/Little Village area has the best Mexican food in the Chicago area, but thats not true, the only place that can compete, but still dosent come close is El Milagro, which serves up good generous steak tacos.Tacos Nietos is one of my fave spots to eat, it has been consistent every time and the staff is always friendly and accomodating.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 1, 21]}, "6": {"description": "As a world traveler (I've been to Canada three times and Maine once), I'd have to say that this place has the most authentic tacos I've ever had in my life. \u00a0I've been to Big Star. \u00a0I've been to Antique Taco, La Pasadita, Taco Joint, etc... \u00a0Tacos Nietos is my favorite. \u00a0I've been to Tacos Nietos close to ten times. \u00a0I have six of their business cards. \u00a0I have one in my jacket pocket as I type this. \u00a0I've also been to Taco Bell. \u00a0My favorite thing at Taco Bell is the Baha Beef Chalupa. \u00a0It should be yours, too. \u00a0Needless to say, Tacos Nietos is my favorite taco spot in Chicago. \u00a0Having said that, I'll go ahead and say this: I went there twice in one day once. \u00a0Anthony Bourdain would love this place. \u00a0Coincidentally, it's on the same street as Calumet Fisheries. \u00a0How'd you miss this place Tony? \u00a0Come on. \u00a0You're better than that. \u00a0Please come back to Chicago and check this place out before Guy Fieri does and ruins it for everybody. \u00a0Thanks so much. \u00a0Shout out to JR, ER and MR for puttin' me on. \u00a0One.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 2, 4]}, "7": {"description": "Loved this place. \u00a0From what I can tell, this place is in a gas station, but delivers on the taste.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 8, 25]}, "8": {"description": "My very favorite taco place in the whole area.

The shrimp: plump, crispy shrimp that's battered and fried to PERFECTION. Each piece is ready to be dunked to one of their savory sauces. Another piece of cholesterol heaven. THE PIZZA BY THE SLICE: So delicious. Huge slice. But DEFINITELY get when it's fresh out of the oven.
