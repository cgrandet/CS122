The pastelillo filling was delicious and this corn based dessert (didn't get the name of it) really hit the spot at the end of the meal. We also tried the steak jibaritos with arroz con gandules and I have to say it brought me back to eating in my best friend's mother's kitchen as a child. \u00a0The staff also \u00a0had a welcoming and attentive demeanor.

However, the food is extremely delectable. Not overly greasy unlike so many other PR restaurants, and the rice was good--none of that orange slime left behind. You know what I'm talking about. I have been here many times and the food never disappoints... Except one time.. We ordered platano and it looked like it was sitting out all day in the Sahara. The owner walked by, took one look at it, and asked why we didn't say anything. She then kindly explained, en espa\u00f1ol, that if customers don't bring problems to her attention then she cannot improve their experience nor her establishment. Some customers might leave and never come back and she will never know why. She immediately took the plate then brought us a freshly prepared one that tasted out of this world delicious.

She did inform me that they do keratin if I was interested. My hair is soft and smooth throughout so I will know how long it lasts on average after this week. I usually can go with maybe just blowing out the roots and using the flat iron if I perspire or get too much steam in the shower. Otherwise I just pin curl or use rollers and a silk scarf. I will definitely go back for a reasonable styling and may try to bring my mom who has a texture more similiar to the ladies in the salon and likes color. Overall not the experience I was dreading.

There's a couple of dishes I judge a restaurant on if they can't nail it. For Chinese cuisine, it's the egg rolls and a chicken dish. Long story short, Kim Long's egg rolls are some of the best I've had. With the chicken, I ordered traditional Thai fried chicken wings and an order of Szechuan chicken. Both dishes had great flavor. The wings weren't big, but had a nice crunch to them. A plus is that they have about 5 or 6 different types of wing flavors to choose from.Ordering was a breeze. Even on new years eve, Kim Long had my wait time only at 20 minutes. Mind blowing, and made me very happy considering Jess Caf\u00e9 told me 4 hours wait time -_-. I picked up my order so I didn't dine in, but I did get a view of the inside. It's small, but has plenty of seating. Jess Cafe was my first choice, but with the ridiculous wait times, I chose to bite the bullet and go somewhere new. I'm glad I did. Kim Long will be my go-to spot for Chinese for now on.

The portion was skimpier than I am used to. The raw onions were cut just right. My mother had hers with grilled onions, and they have the best cut grilled onions I have ever seen; perfectly thin. The sauce was fine, but it could have been creamier and more flavorful. The pita was not browned the way I like, it was too soft.I ordered a chicken Souvlaki and I would not order it again. The portion of chicken was so skimpy it made me mad, and there was too much pita bread for the amount of meat. The chicken itself could have used more seasoning.The cheeseburger was OK.

There is one thing and one thing only that holds me back from doing that, and unfortunately it has nothing to do with the establishment itself, but instead its surroundings- PARKING. The parking here is absolutely ridiculous. Cochiaro's Pizza shares a minuscule parking lot with a large junk gift shop, a Subway, a J.J. Peppers, and I believe a currency exchange (if I'm not mistaken). The problem starts once the lot is full, because then, people begin to park behind you and block your car in. This leads to two things- frequent parking lot rage (and I've seen it get ugly here) and then there are the people who park far from the cement parking strip to avoid being blocked in. It only makes it harder to navigate the lot. Getting out of a spot (if you can find one) can be treacherous. There are people and cars bouncing around everywhere. This says good things about Cochiaro's. The food is great. The prices are dirt cheap. I can get a large slice of cheese pizza, an order of fries (that always come out piping hot and fresh), and a liter of Coca Cola for about three dollars.

There is one thing and one thing only that holds me back from doing that, and unfortunately it has nothing to do with the establishment itself, but instead its surroundings- PARKING. The parking here is absolutely ridiculous. Cochiaro's Pizza shares a minuscule parking lot with a large junk gift shop, a Subway, a J.J. Peppers, and I believe a currency exchange (if I'm not mistaken). The problem starts once the lot is full, because then, people begin to park behind you and block your car in. This leads to two things- frequent parking lot rage (and I've seen it get ugly here) and then there are the people who park far from the cement parking strip to avoid being blocked in. It only makes it harder to navigate the lot. Getting out of a spot (if you can find one) can be treacherous. There are people and cars bouncing around everywhere. This says good things about Cochiaro's. The food is great. The prices are dirt cheap. I can get a large slice of cheese pizza, an order of fries (that always come out piping hot and fresh), and a liter of Coca Cola for about three dollars. Not like I really need a liter, it's just that the price of a liter here is just slightly more than a can, so...why not? I have tried the buffalo strips here, and they weren't that good. I figured this is mainly a pizza spot, but from I read, they excel in other things, so I've just got to try them some time. IF I go back, considering the parking situation totally sucks.

Always served up with toasty pita, it never disappoints.My wife really loves the curried chicken sandwich, and I have to say that it's pretty damn good (whenever I can get her to share a bite with me). They serve it with some sort of amazingly delicious sauce...I think with a yogurt base.This place is not perfect: not so great ambience; it's tucked back behind a Subway in a little strip mall.

I would have been better off ordering any pita sandwich and would have gotten more meat ( I hope) than the dinner plate. The meat was not fresh and was reheated, very dry and no texture. At least give your customers some extra gyro meat since you fail to give enough chicken or beef. Absolutely low class from this establishment and I will never return here no matter what.

Luckily he figured it out and waved the few cents left. I initially asked for the salad with the falafel, but saw that the rice was good. So I asked if I could switch it to a rice instead of a salad and they initially said yes. Then they tell me no cuz it'll be another 25 minutes till its done (mind you, I've already waited about 10 minutes). So I said forget it, just get me the salad.

By this time I'm already frustrated and would rather just get my food and leave, but the reviews raved about the rice so I said I'll just wait for the rice to be done. So I asked if they could do the rice for the falafels as well and they looked all frustrated about me switching my order. YO if you're going to make me wait for 35 minutes, I expect to get what I want. The staff knew I was not happy about the wait and miscommunication, so I expected to get something comped. Nope, nada.

As a \"fine dining\" establishment, you'd think they would let you know ahead of time about a late policy or something. But we still waited to get our table and other couples were filing in late as well behind us, being told the same thing. The young hostess finally relented and seated us all accordingly. The place was packed, so I didn't mind the wait to sit. Then, when seated, we waited at least 15 minutes for our waitress.

We finally place our drink orders and waited another 20-25 minutes to get our drinks. Once we get our drinks, we place our order (no appetizers; I got the enchiladas and my boyfriend got another entree). We wait. Thirty minutes pass by. We tell a waiter we're still waiting. Forty five. We tell the seating hostess we're still waiting. An hour. Boyfriend gets up to get get the owner. He apologizes hastily as he's making drinks behind the bar and says he'll check. At NO point in time does our waitress ask us how we are or acknowledges us, even. Just a quick glance and walks away once. Finally, 15 minutes after we talk with the owner,they tell us our food will STILL take 45 minutes. Now, with no appetizer and just entrees, I was perplexed to see other customers who arrived after us get served their food.

When we walked in we were instantly greeted, and we were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The restaurant had a very comfortable feel, and the music playing in the background made it even better. The menu has a lot of items! Since its a dual Mexican/Honduran restaurant, there's a wide variety of items to choose from.Feeling adventurous, I ordered the baleada and Yucca con Chicharron, and my mom ordered a torta de Lomo(Ribeye). Since everything is made fresh, it took a little time for the food to come out (nothing extreme). When it did come out, everything looked and smelled delicious! The portions were very generous and everything was very flavorful. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because although my mom ordered a lomo torta, she ended up getting a ham and cheese torta. I ordered everything in Spanish so I knew I ordered the lomo, so after asking the waitress why she was given ham instead of lomo she explained that they were out of lomo and a few other items. It wasn't a huge deal, but it would've been better if she told us that prior to bringing out the food. She offered to bring something else, but the torta looked good and we ended up keeping it.

I'd never had Honduran food before and I hadn't spent much time in Belmont-Cragin. Soooo.... it made perfect sense to me to knock two birds out with one stone and get some Honduran grub in the 'hood. To begin with, the restaurant is larger than it seems. Set in a strip mall, form gives way to function, but the function works. Also *extremely* noteworthy: English is not spoken here. You need to come with a Spanish speaker. I spent weeks trying to figure out the menu, hours of operation, etc. by the phone and, finally, just conceded to driving there and poking around. Even though the menu is in English, the service is not and if you don't speak Spanish, you will be frustrated by your experience. You will.That said, my food was enjoyable. There were some hit or miss items so stick with my picks for hits.Hit -- papusa with cheese and beans.Hit -- berry WATER. Don't order your agua fresca con leche. NO! Get it with water and you'll be so much the happier. Every sip I took was refreshing, flavorful and very satisfying. You'll have to take my word on it. Other tried to have a sip, but you know I don't play that. I don't know where your mouth has been. Back up from my beverage. No, not even a new straw will be enough to counter the mystery of your oral history. Sorry. Buy your own. You'll want to. And, you might want to have someone look at *that*. I keed because I love.Hit -- fried chicken with cabbage, Honduran sauce (the name cracks me up; this is tomato and pepper-based; chunky like a salsa, not thick like a paste) and bananas (not plantains). Don't think KFC or, even, your mom's fried chicken. This chicken has a crispy skin that bears a closer texture/taste resemblance to grilled chicken. The components, on their own, aren't very exciting. When mixed together, though, the dish really comes together in a familiar yet comfortably different way. But, like I said, I actually enjoyed my leftovers more than I did the initial meal. Maybe the flavors had time to settle into each other. And, that brings me to my last point -- leftovers!

My quarter chicken was very flavorful but the part of the chicken I got was poor so their wasn't really much meat on the bones.

But beyond the sort of rundown exterior the food inside was top notch. As I had previously discovered with Costa Rican, Honduran resembled Mexican slightly but was different enough to bring new flavors and perspectives into my life. I ordered the Honduran Enchilada \"pero no carne.\" What met my eyes looked like no enchilada I'd ever seen. Open faced on a soft, thick bread it came covered with cabbage (which the menu oddly and hilariously refers to as \"babbage\") and a hard boiled egg on top of the usual bed of beans and rice. The flavors blended so well together and the cabbage added such a wonderful kick that I began to doubt the Mexican restaurants I was used to's preparation of the dish. And at $7.00 for three, I actually had enough for dinner. Take that local taquerias! The chips and salsa (very close to a pico-de-gallo) were also some of the best I've had. Well worth the trip all on their own. Others at the table found their food hit-or-miss. But, one thing I think we all experienced was some very odd service. We were warned about the lack of English that the staff speaks coming in. But even with our Spanish \"translators\" in tow (thanks Janet W. and Rafael C.), water took forever to be re-filled and drink and food orders were actually lost. We were a large group but this was still very off-putting. Still the menu is huge and contains more familiar Mexican dishes for the less adventurous.

It was there before I got in. I don't know if it was from the scraping or what. \u00a0Problem #3 I was using two cards.

I said the rest of my bill. \u00a0He asked $33? I said sure if that's how much I owe. He got mad and said well you owe the other amount. \u00a0I had to do the math in front of him and said to charge the extra $34.30 on the card. \u00a0I really could not figure out why he was unable to do the math.Problem #4 The owner did my mom's manicure.

Got the Greek salad and it had huge chunks of feta, very tasty pepperoncini and crunchy veggies. Salad was great. Not a huge quantity of gluten free options if that's your bag (Celiac, so it's my bag whether I want to be or not), but a few different salads.The woman behind the counter spoke better English than I do Spanish, but obviously had some problems understanding some of my questions (which probably, to be fair, sounded kind of weird--\"Can I get this sandwich that's your special, but without bread?\" \"No thank you, I don't want the noodle soup you're offering to give me for free with my order.\"). That said, she gave me the quizzical look one generally gives when one doesn't understand the language someone is speaking. I know, because I give that look often at the Polish deli up the street.Stresses on the health of the food options on the menu and on the signs on the front of the place lead me to believe it was more of a health food joint, which was why I went there--not because I need some trendy vegan/foodie/locavore spot, but more because those places at least know what gluten is, even if they don't know why I, personally, care about it. However, it really is more of a diner with some organic food. Also, as others have noted, this is not a coffee shop in the way that Portage Grounds is a coffee shop. More in the \u00a0way that you might think of a spot to get a good cup of joe. There is no coffee bar here (nor, really, a juice \"bar\" as the menu professes--even though there are a LOT of juice drink options). I saw nary an espresso machine. As I said, it's good food, but its advertising is a bit misleading.Oh. One more thing. Can't remember if I saw this on other reviews, but I didn't see a credit card machine, nor any signs that said they took credit cards.

It was very salty, and while there was loads of seafood in it, the saltiness took over the flavors. I ordered a bottle of Mexican Coke (cane sugar, not corn syrup - it's excellent and hard to find) but it never arrived, a can did instead so I drank that rather than attempt to get another.

I didn't mention the sign outside advertised a different price because I would've felt petty. When the slices of pizza were brought to me, they were piping hot...Which isn't a bad thing at all, but in this case the piping hot slices were on styrofoam plates that were melting and turning black. I didn't say anything about this to the waitress because I didn't want to be rude and I was also in a hurry. Styrofoam aside, the pizza was horrible. Worst slice of pizza I have ever had, hands down. It was very bland even with crushed red peppers and parmesan added. There might be other items they serve that might be delicious but never order single slices of cheese pizza from this place.

I thought I might be able to cheat the system, however, by planning ahead. But first, let me back up. I was on the hunt for three particular styles of bridesmaid dresses from one particular designer for my friend's wedding. I had called around a handful of bridal shops in the area and Discount Sarah's Bridal was the only one that had all three. I called in ahead of time to confirm this and let them know I was planning on coming in a couple of hours. The gentleman on the phone told me they'd locate and set them aside so I could try on all three when I arrived. However, when I got there, only one of the dresses had been found. To be fair, it was a Saturday, and there were probably about five other individuals (plus their friends) perusing the shop for dresses, and only two workers. While I didn't expect them to dote on me, I was surprised when, after trying on the one dress, I was told to just search the rest of the store, dress by dress, for the remaining two, on my own (kind of defeating the purpose of calling in ahead of time). It wouldn't have been so bad if there were any kind of system or order for how the dresses were stored and organized, such as by designer or dress style (strapless over here, one-shouldered here, V-neck over there, etc.). It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. When I asked if I could get a little assistance in even beginning to know where to look, I was told I *was* being helped--as the only two employees were conspicuously tending to other customers. Like I said, I didn't expect to be doted on, and I wouldn't have even minded having to look on my own if 1) I hadn't gone in with the expectation that the dresses were going to be found for me in the hours between when I called and inquired about them and when I arrived, and/or 2) one of the workers would have been upfront in saying, when I arrived, the other dresses hadn't been found yet, that they were going to try to help when they could, but I may need to do some searching on my own while they were helping other people.

So frustrated with this place. I went wedding dress shopping in late April/early May for an August wedding in Colorado. When I found a great dress at Sarah's Bridal, I was very excited to get it at what I believed is well below market price. So I happily paid the deposit, and asked when my dress would arrive. The assistant told me they typically ship dresses at least a month prior to the wedding date (Aug 5th), and I told her since the wedding is not in Chicago, they should subtract a week from that. She said no problem, she'd let the distributor know and they'd adjust the shipping date.In mid May, I called to verify that the dress would be shipping in June/July. She said she didn't have a ship date yet, but to call back in a few weeks. So I did. June 8, June 11, June 25, July 9. Still the same response - they don't have a ship date yet, and I should keep calling back.It's the week of July 19th (2.5 weeks out) , and I'm starting to panic a bit. I call, and the owner (a gentleman) states the shipping date is now July 25th (a Sunday?). I tell him that's not acceptable, as I leave for Colorado on the 31st. He promises it only takes 4 days to arrive. I say 'but that puts arrival on Friday, and I leave on Saturday'. He claims 'no problem, you come in on Friday and we can do alterations in the same day'. Wonderful, except I have to work on Friday having saved my days off for my actual wedding (silly me!). Also, same day alterations make me a bit nervous about the quality they're providing.He then gives me the option to pay an extra $70+ to ship it overnight. After considering it over the weekend, I call on July 26 to say yes please, ship it overnight. The assistant tells me she'll call at noon with a tracking number, and confirm the dresses expected arrival date today, July 27. I wait and then call at 1pm, and the owner says he can't give me a tracking number, but the dress is arriving today he promises, '100%'. I ask why no tracking number, and his response is that UPS will put him on hold for too long and he knows the dress is coming anyway. I even volunteer to call UPS to save him the trouble (seriously) but he says no, they won't give it to me. He does promise to call when my dress gets in, thank you very much. Talk about going above and beyond for your customer.If the dress does arrive today as promised, I will faint with relief, and then run as fast as I can away from this place. While getting a good deal on a dress is great, they aren't worth the hassle.UPDATE: The dress arrived, as promised. They even took $35 off the $70 overnight charge, which was appreciated.

I would come here again for alterations.I came here to get a dress altered that I bought somewhere else. They gave me a fair estimate for the amount of work that needed to be done ($60- $10 cheaper than anywhere else I found).The place in general is kinda disorganized. I had to wait about 15 minutes while someone else was trying on dresses to even talk to someone. Once the worker (who turned out to be the owner) was done, she gave me undivided attention. It took about 20 minutes more for the dress to be pinned where it needed to be.They told me the dress would be done in 3 days. Sweet! They would call me. A week later they still hadn't called, but when I called the dress was ready. Okie dokie. I went in that day. Waited another 20 minutes for the owner to acknowledge me (I should have expected that...) and finally got my dress.I get the dress back and it fits like a glove! She even added in some little bra-strap-fasteners for no charge. I was very happy with the work done. Absolutely no complaints.The place is cash only. Keep that in mind when you go. They let you pay with a credit card if it's something like 2 weeks before you pick up the dress, but I didn't do that, so I had to run across the street to a bank.

I initially came here once with my mom first to see if the place was worth a shot. Walking in, the amount of dresses on the racks is extremely intimidating. We basically weren't even acknowledged, so after about 10 minutes of browsing on our own we walked to the back of the store where we found someone there (I think the owner). We were pressed on time as it was our last stop shop for the day, so I figured I would come back with all of my bridesmaids.Now the mess begins. When we arrived, we were told to browse around by ourselves and pick out some dresses we liked. She just stood there not really asking any questions or being helpful at all. We finally found a few beginning styles of what we would like the dresses to look like, so all she did was stick the girls in a room and walk away. There were little pin needles all over the floor of the dressing room that one of my bridesmaids almost stepped on until she saw (um how is that even safe?) Anyways, when my bridesmaids walked out and were talking about the dresses and what they liked or didn't like I had a question. (HERE IS THE PART YOU NEED TO READ) The woman finally came around and I decided to ask how the alterations would work considering one of my bridesmaids was determined to lose weight before my wedding. She even made a b***** comment prior to fetching the dresses for the girls saying \"Don't worry we have a bigger size in that style to fit her too\" as she was pointing out my friend. Then, when she looked at my friend when she stepped out in the dress she proceeded to ask \"Well how many months pregnant is she?\" asking all of us...... UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM mind everyone reading this, my friend is A. not pregnant and B. not even close to looking like she is!!!!! Rude, disrespectful, ignorant, and just extremely messed up for a BUSINESS OWNER to assume something like that of someone who is a potential buyer in their store. WTF was she thinking!?!?!? Wait, clearly she wasn't thinking before she spoke. I felt really terrible as my bridesmaid locked the door to the fitting room and started crying. Seeing my friend cry over an extremely uncalled for insult by a woman working a business was enough to convince me to never step foot in there again. She clearly felt really STUPID and walked away and then came back trying to show us a different dress. I confronted her telling her we were going to leave and that she owed an apology. She apologized to me as I cut her off telling her NO, you need to apologize to the person who you made the remark to, that was really mean! And she said \"I'm sorry\" as quickly as she possibly could, NOT EVEN MEANING IT, not being genuine, just because she had to. What an ugly person. The fact that I had to confront her about apologizing just goes to show what kind of ignorant person she is. I will never go back here again.I will never recommend this place to anyone.I will never wish this type of negative experience upon even my worst enemy.I will NEVER tolerate someone treating people I care about in this type of way.I just wanted to point out that a bride shopping with her bridesmaids for dresses should be a positive, fun, exciting experience. I feel like owners of bridal shops should encourage this. The fact that she had the nerve to insult my best friend just like that PISSED me off more than anything as I walked out of there dealing with a racing heart, shocked mood, and upset friend. F that.

We were going to go with medium tint but after seeing the finished car which is also black color with light tint on the front and medium tint on the back we decided to go with lighter tint which was what Danny suggest. This doesn't make the car too dark and is legal. Last thing we want is be worrying about getting tickets. The price was great and cheaper than couple places I had called so we left the car there and Danny told us to come back in 3 hours. When we came back to pick up the car we were really happy with the work. Light tint came out perfectly with black car.

I paid $45 which is cheaper than I've paid before but I can see why...They said my toes were ready to go so I put on my shoes and when I got home there was a chunk of polish that came off from my right big toe. Then I noticed that the edges of my mani (along the cuticles) didn't have any top coat, so it looked as the top coat (shiny) was only along the center of my nails. I went in the following Monday (after calling the next day to tell them what was wrong) to get my hands and toe fixed. Well all would have been fine since they fixed my mani.

If you're a fan of deep dish pizzas then this place may disappoint you since as far as I know they do not offer a pan pizza. \u00a0I can't honestly say this is the best pizza I've had in my almost 2 years of living here in The Windy City, but I can say without hesitation that they do make one of the best pizzas I've had the pleasure of eating here. \u00a0As far as the bakery products go I'm not really that thrilled, but in all fairness to them their bakery products are the same as other Mexican bakeries I've tried and none of them really thrill me. \u00a0I think it's just that I'm an old white guy who grew up in an all white small town with no exposure to ethnic foods so don't give my opinion on their bakery products too much weight in your decision to try their products. \u00a0There is however one bakery product that they do make that I do love. \u00a0Hopefully I'll get the name correct. \u00a0I believe it's called \"bolillos con queso y jalapenos\". \u00a0Basically it's a large roll that has cream cheese and jalapeno slices inside it. \u00a0As you can probably guess I am not into spicy foods, but I love those rolls since for some reason the jalapenos have a little heat to them, but not enough to make me sweat much. \u00a0I suspect the reason the jalapenos in them are bearable to me and I can actually taste the flavor is that they have been seeded before being used in these rolls. \u00a0Even if you're like me and can't stand much heat I'd encourage everybody who likes jalapeno flavor but doesn't like the usual intense burning to try these awesome rolls.They do also have a small but fairly diverse selection of other meal items and also offer hot wings (I've tried their barbecue wings and they were a touch to spicy for me, but like I say I don't tolerate heat well) so you may want to consider some of their other meal options also. \u00a0As far as dine in facilities go they do have around 10 tables and the place is clean and adequate, but it is not someplace you'd take a lady to impress her with the ambiance. \u00a0It's very clean and the cashiers are all friendly (fluent in both English and Spanish). \u00a0You'll need to go to the cashier to place your order since there is not table service with a menu like in most restaurants. \u00a0The furniture is booths that are not padded, but they are in very good condition and well cleaned so it's a perfectly fine place to eat, it's just not a first date kind of place.If you enjoy a good thin crust pizza with an excellent tasting crust then I'd strongly encourage you to try this establishment over Mama Luna's which is the Italian restaurant nearby since I think this place definitely outdoes them. \u00a0If you live in this area they do deliver so that's another plus for this place.

Needless to say I was disappointed, as was he, especially upon finding out how much they cost.I told him we could take me back and probably get them replaced. When we got to the shop I explained the situation and showed the gal working that day that there were already dead flowers and others that weren't so healthy. I had a bunch of tulips from the previous week that looked healthier than the ones in the bouquet. I get flower at least 2-3 times a month so have an idea of what healthy flowers look like. She insisted the flowers were healthy and said she could replace the dead ones. When I pointed at the ones that were dying, she was adamant about them being healthy and a little argumentive about it. I was getting a little upset about the situation and told her to replace what she could and left.I'm sorry but isn't the customer the reason why you are there and changing out a few flowers would have not been that difficult and to do it without attitude?Well here we are a week later and most the flowers look like crap.

When Taylor and I connected by phone, she advised that they could definitely help me, and took the time to walk through my list, sharing the per-stem prices of each of my desired blooms. Many of them were about $10 each, and as such, she explained that even increasing my budget to $200, would allow them to do a great deal more, giving them $20 per bouquet. This turned out to be doable for me, and I really appreciated that she was very straight forward, but kind. She didn't pressure me, and gave me the impression that she really wanted to stay true to what I wanted, but supply the highest quality flowers possible for what I could spend. She assured me that it wouldn't be a problem for me to provide my own vessels (assorted jam jars) and pick up the flowers myself, the morning of the event. A family member picked up the bouquets, and brought them to the event venue the day of the party, and when they were unpacked, I was absolutely blown away by their inventive, creative beauty.

I come rushing in to pick it up and it was not even ready or decorated!! As soon as I asked if my cake was ready? They rushed and started decorating it right in front of me. I was very upset. They take their orders in a plain yellow notepad and have to guess which one is your cake by you describing the decorations you asked for. SMH.Another thing, My sister ordered a cake for her wedding and guess what?, They forgot to make her cake! My sister was furious! On her wedding day?! They claimed that they had lost her order. Well, of course they did, they have teenagers running the place and no actual order sheets with order numbers or anything, Like I said, they use a plain yellow notepad to take orders. My sister was upset that she didn't had a wedding cake on her special Day. They refunded her the money she paid for but her day was a little ruined since every bakery was booked to make wedding cakes at the last minute. Great Cakes, Bad Service. They have 2 strikes with me, 1 more and they lose me as a customer.

The fries are pretty gross - soggy and greasy, just because they're fresh it doesn't mean that they're any good, I'd rather have over processed fries from Burger King at any given day than taste these \"fresh\" soggy greasy ass fries, ever heard of the term Crispy and savory? All the food was soggy reallly, specially that awfully dark green, old looking lettuce in my burger. I was also expecting more bacon on my double bacon and cheddar burger, nevertheless the meat was actually pretty good and medium-well, the way I like it. This has become a last resort place to get food, if I had more time on my hands, I'd go the extra mile, west on Belmont and get a few steak tacos from Taco Burrito King instead, and I'd probably spend less money and the food will be delicious.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 6, 25]}, "40": {"description": "Walked in with my girlfriend and 1yr old daughter.

I love those seasoned ground meat with potatoes filling deep fried pastries. They hit the spot \u00a0I can eat 2-3 of those bad boys as a meal itself. They are also pretty cheap, I think like $1.75 each. The chuletas are seasoned and fried just right. Reminds me of my comadres family recipe.

They offer it on a stick with a whole oreo frozen in the middle as well as scooped.4) Pistachio ice cream has tons of REAL pistachios in it. Unlike Baskin Robbins that use almonds in their pistachio ice cream. 5) I haven't tried an ice cream I didn't like here. Their Dulce de Leche, Pecan, Pistachio, French Vanilla, Oreo, Vanilla/chocolate, and strawberry are among my favorites so far. Haven't tried them all yet.

I did notice that their strawberries and cream are made from frozen strawberries, which I disliked since you have to wait a bit for them to thaw. What they have going for them is their location. Maybe I am not looking hard enough, but there is a scarcity of Mexican/Hispanic ice cream shops in the north side of Chicago, making this shop a treasure in this area. Keeps this in mind when you visit, as the demand for this shop does tend to create a bit of a wait, especially on hotter days, but then again this should be expected from any establishment offering refreshing treats. This is not your run of the mill ice cream shop where everything is made like clock-work.

As soon as I walked in the owner gave me a sample - a cherry donut hole (wow, even the donut holes come in a variety of flavors!) Cherry donuts are one of my favorites, so I got one of those, plus a blueberry, a chocolate frosted, glazed chocolate cake, cruller, and deluxe red velvet. Took them home for my family to sample, and everyone agreed these were top notch.All the varieties were light and melt-in-your mouth. The blueberry actually tasted like a blueberry muffin shaped into a donut. The chocolate donuts had a good chocolate taste, and the red velvet was amazing. I've never had a yeast version of red velvet before, or one that was glazed instead of being smothered with cream cheese frosting. The glaze instead of frosting really let the flavor shine through.This shop is a bit off the beaten path, but worth the drive. Actually, it would be worth taking the CTA. The basic donuts here reasonably priced at 85 cents each (\"fancy\" ones are 1.29-1.59).

I don't suggest they abandon the majority of their customers who are Hispanic, but they may want to start carrying more of the basics that us caucasian Americans need and desire.On the positive side I've always found their employees to be very nice and easy to deal with so that is why I've given this store a 4 star rating. \u00a0Since it is a Mexican store in a Hispanic neighborhood there is a good chance that the employees you interact with may have limited English speaking skills, but hey it's part the total experience that I enjoyed living in a Hispanic neighborhood so I don't consider that to be a negative. \u00a0I only mention that so others who may not speak Spanish won't be too surprised.I found the prices at this store to be reasonable for a small grocery store. \u00a0Not as cheap generally speaking as say Walmart or Jewel Osco but sometimes it's worth it to pay a little a little more to have the convenience of walking to a neighborhood store instead of fighting traffic to get to a large store. \u00a0If you buy the sale items then they are pretty comparable to larger chain grocery stores.Stop in and check this store out. \u00a0It's a nice convenience for those that live in this neighborhood. \u00a0I never got around to trying the grill there, but after reading the other review I may have to go back there just to try that out. \u00a0If I do I'll update the review with my take on that.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 3, 16]}}, "latitude": 41.92447, "neighborhoods": ["Cragin"], "categories": [["Grocery", "grocery"], ["Mexican", "mexican"]], "address": ["5020 W Fullerton Ave"], "attributes": {"Accepts Credit Cards": "No"}, "longitude": -87.75214, "category": "Restaurants", "rating": "4.0", "price": "$", "number_of_reviews": "1"}}
