The selection is pretty bad because it's just not a big chain store.2.) They were struggling financially so they converted literally half of the store into porn, which can be good or bad depending on your motives.Recently they made it so you can have your movies for something like three days, which is nice because back in the day it used to be that you could only have it overnight, so this is much easier. No pressure to watch it that day.They take fairly good care of the DVDs. Out of the literally hundreds of times I've rented something, I've only gotten one or two DVDs that were beyond repair and they just let me trade it in for a different movie. It was alright for me because I only have to walk but that could be frustrating for people who live far away.The people who work there are very nice (my best friend actually just started working there) and they have an \"employees picks\" section which, if you know the person has good taste, can be great if you just want to rent a movie but don't know what to get.Three stars.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 10, 10]}, "0": {"description": "I went there for video transfer.,, it took them 2 weeks as quoted and was no more expensive then quoted. \u00a0excellent job...

Now that I am bench pressing 420 and flirting with a 36-inch waist, I don't see cause to come here much, but it's still pretty decent food. The burgers are not the best, but, as one other reviewer said, they will do in a pinch. The dogs are fantastic, but I tend to need four of them just to fight off the hunger crankiness. In other words, I'm still kind of hungry after four. (That is, I was; now that I have this awesome body, three hot dogs might fill me up. I really don't know. All I can say for certain is that I look guh-ood. Like, if I looked this good when Moses was around, God would've created an eleventh commandant**: \"Dudes, don't be jealous of Tommy, and don't go wasting my time--sabbath or not--trying to be like him. It ain't never gonna happen.\")Where Wojo's shines is in the shake and the ham and cheese department. Many establishments serve good shakes, but the shakes at Wojo's are memorably good. When I was twelve (and not yet fat), I went to Wojo's and consumed a strawberry shake that was so good that I could visualize the chemical reactions between the shake and my taste buds. It was like looking at a map of the Silver War, where next to the names of towns like Gettysburg or Chickamauga, the cartographer inserted an image of an explosive to indicate that a battle took place there. Well, while drinking down that damn shake, I could not help imagining my tongue splattered with little explosions. (That really did happen.) It was like there was an invasion, a war, going on in my mouth--except that this was a war for good, like Vietnam. I've never had a shake like since; in fact, taste invasions of my tongue have been few. Wojo's makes a good shake.Now, I know many people don't dig on swine, but if you want a ham and cheese, turn the damn frying pan off, fish the wrapper out of the garbage can and wrap the cheese back up in it, let your dog eat the ham, and head on over to Wojo's. You ain't gonna make it better than they do, so why bother? Far be it from me to discourage anyone (unless you work out and cannot put up 300 lbs.; if so, why bother working out at all? Why not just go skip some rope or double-dutch?), but it's best to know when you've been beaten. \u00a0The ham and cheese sandwiches at Wojo's are delicious. The place is heavy on the calories, of course, which is why, the last time I went (two weeks ago), I got my son, in the middle of a three basketball game-Saturday, a few dogs and nothing for myself.Finally, I like Donald M.'s review--particularly the part in which he says, \"This place has been here forever. . . . Don't over look this mom and pop place. \u00a0Keep the character of America strong and screw the \u00a0big guys.\" He's right.** I am sure he meant to say \"commandment.\"", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 1, 15]}, "31": {"description": "You know - it's a really, really good thing that I chose to spend the majority of my money on other (ahem) addictions in high school because if I hadn't, I would've ended up as the half ton teen on that TLC show.

I said that I have never paid $40.00 for a no chip and that when I asked how much, she told me $35.00. She argued with me about the $5.00 and said they had to use cotton and foil, which I said is standard at all other salons I visited and that I will not be returning to her salon.

I loved everything about it.Well now, life has gone full circle for me and I have a job at St. Xavier University, 2 miles from where I grew up, 1 mile from where I went to high school, and 1 mile from my old favorite Mexican restaurant. So when my new supervisor asked where I'd like to go to celebrate starting my new job, I recommended there.It wasn't bad by any means, just... disappointing.First off, the service was slower than hell. Sure, it was 12 on a Tuesday, but still, it took an eternity (note:this is an exaggeration, not to be taken literally) for each stage of the dining process to take place. We sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to greet us. Then several minutes before we could order, then five or ten minutes before and refills were offered, etc. etc. Then when the food did come. It tasted good, but was kind of a mess. My tacos were lying on top of each other in such a way that they were all really soggy and hard to eat. I will admit the flavor was about as good as I remember, but poor plating can hurt a meal. I'm not a judge on Chopped here, just keep the food in good condition for me.In other, less hard to mess up meals, some of my co-workers got a torta they were raving about, but were perplexed that it came with fries. Oh and their chips and salsa are absolutely fantastic here. Overall, though, it was disappointing.

Since I read other peoples reviews on here before hand, I was not expecting to be blown away by their food, & I wasn't. The salsa that came with the chips before the meal tasted like some Pace or Tostito's jar salsa from your local grocery store. (the chips were good, however) I ordered chicken tacos, & my girlfriend ordered steak fajitas. The portions were definitely plentiful, as I only could put down two tacos (the appetizers were filling) I did finish all the rice & beans, which were probably the high point of the meal. Other than that, the food is neither good nor bad. Just \"meh\". Not a place to go if you're seeking authenticity in Mexican food.

I was happy to see their newest site less than a mile from my house. My family--all adults, parents, siblings, spouses, niece and nephew--ate here last night. Our party of \u00a0nine was almost too big for the place--we over-filled the largest table. (Tables are round and can't be pushed together.) The food is okay. Not great, but pretty good. Between all of us, we sampled a good variety of food, and no one was dissatisfied. The portions are large--we all took home doggie bags. But the prices are higher than average for the area. If you go out for pizza/casual dining, it's a little pricey. The place is new, and they don't seem \"complete\", yet. I'm sure they eventually add artwork to the brick walls and expand their playlist (though I do appreciate Springsteen! All the other music was Italian pop). Parking is terrible. There's very limited space on the street, and the side streets are one-way and/or cul-de-sacs. There was an initiative in this neighborhood several years ago to address traffic problems by severely reducing thru-streets. This has had mixed results. I'm sure the residents appreciate less traffic roaring past their homes after the (many) area bars close. But for patrons of businesses, it's a pain. I think this is the main reason so many business at this site fail. For businesses that rely on quick transactions (picking up a Tata's pizza or running into the hardware store) parking spots open up fast. But sit-down restaurants don't have that level of parking turnover. Bottom line: be prepared to park a block or two away and then walk. My main concern was the slippery flooring. When we arrived, it was pouring rain. The floor was a little slick from people tracking in water. You just had to be careful and pay attention. But the rain stopped and the floor seemed much drier on the way out--NOT ! There were still some slippery sections. This was nerve-racking, because we dined with my parents, who are in their late 80's. (My dad walks with a cane.) I escorted him, but I was skidding in a few places. I think it's the flooring. I hope management figures out how to handle this, possibly having someone assigned to continually dry the flooring whenever it's wet out, or maybe installing more absorbent floor coverings in the entrance way. I can't think of another restaurant where I've been this concerned about the floors. I hope this business survives and that I'll have the chance to eat here again--though frankly, unless it's for a sandwich, it's a little out of our budget.

I was happy to see their newest site less than a mile from my house. My family--all adults, parents, siblings, spouses, niece and nephew--ate here last night. Our party of \u00a0nine was almost too big for the place--we over-filled the largest table. (Tables are round and can't be pushed together.) The food is okay. Not great, but pretty good. Between all of us, we sampled a good variety of food, and no one was dissatisfied. The portions are large--we all took home doggie bags. But the prices are higher than average for the area. If you go out for pizza/casual dining, it's a little pricey. The place is new, and they don't seem \"complete\", yet. I'm sure they eventually add artwork to the brick walls and expand their playlist (though I do appreciate Springsteen! All the other music was Italian pop). Parking is terrible. There's very limited space on the street, and the side streets are one-way and/or cul-de-sacs. There was an initiative in this neighborhood several years ago to address traffic problems by severely reducing thru-streets. This has had mixed results. I'm sure the residents appreciate less traffic roaring past their homes after the (many) area bars close. But for patrons of businesses, it's a pain. I think this is the main reason so many business at this site fail. For businesses that rely on quick transactions (picking up a Tata's pizza or running into the hardware store) parking spots open up fast. But sit-down restaurants don't have that level of parking turnover. Bottom line: be prepared to park a block or two away and then walk. My main concern was the slippery flooring. When we arrived, it was pouring rain. The floor was a little slick from people tracking in water. You just had to be careful and pay attention. But the rain stopped and the floor seemed much drier on the way out--NOT ! There were still some slippery sections. This was nerve-racking, because we dined with my parents, who are in their late 80's. (My dad walks with a cane.) I escorted him, but I was skidding in a few places. I think it's the flooring. I hope management figures out how to handle this, possibly having someone assigned to continually dry the flooring whenever it's wet out, or maybe installing more absorbent floor coverings in the entrance way. I can't think of another restaurant where I've been this concerned about the floors. I hope this business survives and that I'll have the chance to eat here again--though frankly, unless it's for a sandwich, it's a little out of our budget.

Squee!) within a reasonable driving distance (to get some take out nosh, that is) and for a reasonable price (a small, plain \"cheese\" cost less than twelve bucks)?Oh.hells.yes.Now, listen. I've been doing the vegan thing long enough to eat plenty of 'za (probably far more than I should ;) sans cheese, sneaky egg washes, and the like. But sometimes a girl just wants to get up on a soy-cheese laden slice of deliciousness. Amirite?Now, some of the obvious pluses are price and location (at least for me). We also ordered at, say, six-something on a Friday night & twenty minutes later, we had a pizza in our car, ready to rumble. We went with the straight up \"cheese\" (which, from the looks of it, is Teese) because I wanted to see this beauty in all it's glory before filling it to the max with veggies (next time). Here's my quick analysis:1. It was cut beautifully. This is a big plus in my book.2. The crust was interesting in a good way. Light and flaky but with enough body to hold up all the goods.3. The sauce was interesting in an interesting way. It was sweet, but almost had a kick to it. Jury's out on this one. I usually gravitate more toward a simple, robust sauce but this was not bad at all...just interesting in an interesting way.4. The \"cheese\"...was....well, good but it needed some help. Teese comes in round tubes and it was pretty obvious that they did the old slice-and-slap with the circles. This left some gaping sauce parts, and some areas double coated with cheese. Another gripe of mine? Cut the slices thin if you're not going to grate them. There were a couple of bites where I actually had to deep six cheese since it was pretty much like a foot deep (okay, not really...but you catch my drift). Ultimately, while I know it's a PIA, grating the cheese is the way to go. Or hell, switch to Daiya where it's already shredded. (And admittedly, I'm biased there since I loves me some Daiya.) But I wasn't impressed with the whole drop a slab here, drop a slice there, drop a slab here routine. In short: yes, I will order again and next time with veggies galore. Definitely worth checking this out if vegan pizza is your bag and you rock the southside something fierce. :)Oh, and PS - call first to make sure they're offering vegan pizza. My husband called once a few weeks ago and they weren't serving it that day.

The coupon featured the Tata's logo, address, phone number, etc. The date on the coupon was 10/15/15, valid for 30 days after that date on Monday's only. So we decided to give it a try last night. The girl on the phone was very nice and sweet and kindly told me that the business no longer accepts these coupons and hasn't in over two years. I was a little puzzled and questioned her about it, as Chili's seems to be pretty reputable company that offers these types of \"prizes\" every week at a ton of different bars in the area. She was very apologetic and after her explanation, she offers me the opportunity to speak to the owner. I hear her explaining the situation to him before giving him the phone. He immediately gets on the phone, no hello or friendly greeting, he just immediately says \"I don't know where you got that from or who the hell is using my name, but we stopped giving those away years ago, I am not honoring that coupon\" Again, I have no problem with him not accepting my freebie coupon if I received it in error. However, when I attempted to tell him that he should contact Chili's and let them know, he wouldn't let me talk and just kept saying \"I'm not honoring it!!!\" Ok guy. I get it. You don't want my business. I'm going to assume that he pegged me as a cheapo who wouldn't still place an order if he didn't honor my coupon. Well, he was wrong. Had he been the slightest bit of a nice guy about the whole thing, we would have gladly still placed an order. Instead, he was a total jerk to me.

The prices are not low enough for the quality. \u00a0I expected so much more. \u00a0I hope this restaurant can do better. \u00a0Maybe the pasta is really their specialty and they should stick to that.After we left the restaurant we were still hungry.We only had water to drink and our bill was $50 (not including tip).I think this restaurant needs some work, but please don't get rid of Adam", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 5, 20]}, "21": {"description": "Very good food.

Well, not ALL of the employees, just the hard working deli women who get our pizza set ups and bag our goods. Paid under the table and below minimum wage, these women are entitled to be rude from time to time. Their lack of smiles is not why we stopped shopping there. My husband and I are also small business owners and abide by the law and make monetary sacrifices to provide a decent wage for our employees. We cannot respect any business, especially in our very own neighborhood that doesn't do the same. We have been trying to spread the word about the shady practices of this mom and pop shop for months now. Every community event we go to, it is a topic of discussion. You can't attend anything involving Mt. Greenwood/Beverly without S&T Provisions coming up. 111th St. is something we should be proud of as a community, they have made the way they run their business a disgrace.
