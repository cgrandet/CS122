I ordered 6 vegan sopes to go, but when I got home, I realized that I had been given meat tacos. Now, I can totally see the confusion: vegan sopes, meat tacos, basically the same thing. Whatever, no big deal.I went back, as I live relatively close, and explained the error. Joanna, the woman who took my first order, was rude, curt, and seemed exceptionally annoyed, but finally offered to give me my damn sopes. When I gave her my order once again, I began to tell her I wanted it vegan, no dairy or cheese, but she cut me off and claimed that she was vegan, too, and understood. I doubt it, but that's fine, I smiled and thanked her. When I got my order, I realized that there was non-vegan cheese and sour cream on my sopes. I brought this to Joanna's attention, who told me that it was my fault for not telling her to give me vegan cheese and no sour cream specifically, despite the fact that I asked for non-dairy VEGAN sopes multiple times, which makes it pretty clear that there shouldn't be DAIRY on them, but she just began to yell at me and arguing that she would not fix it. She ranted about how I need to order correctly next time, as though I would ever give La Cochina my business again. Honestly, it's one thing to get an order wrong twice, it's one thing to refuse to fix it, but to yell at me on top of it? I used to frequent La Cochina.

They are friendly and accommodating your needs as a vegan or vegetarian and I feel like I've gone in with them already knowing my order (even if the one man politely takes it anyway). Bad customer service or rude staff can completely ruin a restaurant (like Quesadilla La Reyna; it is the absolute worst!!!).I love a burrito that has the right proportions of all ingredients, and when the produce is fresh and crunchy (not mushy or mealy), and fresh and crunchy is exactly what you get there.Being a burrito-a-holic and not eating meat for many years either, I'm used to a vegetarian burrito simply not containing meat, so I'm not big on the fake meats on my burrito. I do love Upton's products and use them in other preparations, just not here. I always get a burrito with extra avocado, beans, rice, vegan cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro and onion. You do pay for vegan cheese and extra avocado, so maybe if you do take out, just add your own extra avocado or vegan cheese if you're set on not paying extra for this. Regardless, I gladly pay a little extra to get everything I want on a perfectly rolled, deliciously fresh burrito.

We got the Mac and cheese-a little spicy, but not very at all, it's pimento cheese, which is amazing as a cheese ball, add noodles? I'll have 2, thanks. The kale slaw was tasty too, it had little pink seeds(?) on top, I couldn't figure out what they were, but they were tasty. Corn muffins are like 2 bites, in adorable honeycomb shape and delicious, I recommend getting an extra one if you're a huge corn muffin fan like me :) I got the 2 piece fried chicken, you don't specify white or dark meat, I got a leg and breast, which were both juicy and crunchy. Seasoning was awesome, and once you get past the split second where your brain says \"warning! butter on fried chicken!? Hello cholesterol!\" It's amazing. And you must put the butter on the chicken.

I'd been looking forward to going here for a long time and honestly was really disappointed. The only redeeming part of my nearly $30 meal was the honey butter. But that's not really the food, it's the condiment, the dressing for the food. I ordered the 4-piece chicken and while it was moist on the inside, it was overly crunchy--like tooth-breakingly crunchy-- on the outside. Without the honey butter slathered on the outside, it was less than mediocre. Also, they're not fried chicken in the traditional sense, but more like chicken strips. The only piece that had a bone was the drumstick and maybe I didn't read the menu carefully, but I'm pretty sure it said a combination of bone-in and boneless pieces. I was not aware that 3/4 pieces would be boneless. Fried chicken to me is not coated in breading, fried to a rock solid piece and then drowned in honey butter to mask the lack of flavors. It should have been great on its own and the honey butter would be there to take it to the next level. Three stars because the honey butter saved it from being one or two stars. The kale and cabbage cole slaw was so blagh, it was like mayo and kale and cabbage mixed together. Each person in my party of three had one bite and that was it. The general consensus was that it was definitely not good. Seriously don't get this. Zero stars. The blood orange lemonade was alright. It wasn't particularly lemon-ey or blood orange-y. It was just super tart and diluted with too many ice cubes. One star. The dump cake was meh. Too many cherries and not enough chocolate, according to my Texan friend who was with us. I would have to agree. One star. I had really high expectations for this place, especially since the reviews rated it so highly, but I doubt I will be returning of my own volition for fried chicken.

The chicken is absolutely delicious, enough said. Remember to put the honey butter on it! Mac n cheese is really rich, almost hard to eat the whole side by yourself, but still very, very good. Corn muffins are great, hard to screw those up.HBFC lived up to the hype for me.

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE/COMFORTFor my daughter's birthday we took a small group for dinner. The line was long but considering it was Saturday night in the city, we didn't have to wait THAT long but the atmosphere is cramped, loud, and just feels stifling and uncomfortable.Once seated, the experience isn't any better, really, except that now you're eating. Unfortunately, you eat at a quick pace as you see the lines of people waiting for your seats -- so a sense to \"hurry up\" was always there. It's not relaxing. The seats and tables are hard wood and uninviting. It was very cold out. We were seated by the front door where cold air wafted in, in intervals.The music is loud and seemed to get louder as we stayed. The acoustics are that of a constant din of loud chatter and blaring music. The seating is tight and the dining area feels like a school lunchroom. \u00a0It's not an environment to get cozy and talk (you have to speak loudly to hear your friends/family) but it's also not one for raucous fun and partying either so it misses the mark for me. The meal was expensive for what it is but then served on trays with paper plates and paper napkins (fortunately, not plastic forks and knifes).You are asked to tip before you get your food and before anyone serves you. Now, I am a big tipper, always, but frankly I'm getting annoyed by all the places that expect high tips for doing very little. (Do I need to tip a Starbucks barista for taking my order and then actually giving it to me?) Here you order your food at the counter as you are standing and waiting. Then you wait to sit down and when you sit down, your dinner order gets started in the kitchen and not before. Then your food is brought out in little basket trays and voila', you've been served what you ordered at the counter.Yes, a bunch of people kept asking us if we were doing okay but, they really didn't need to and we just kept saying, \"yeah\". They're there if you need more than you ordered and will take payment for that thing right at the table at the moment of ordering.FOODFor as good as the chicken looked, I found it decent but unremarkable. Though juicy, it was bland. I didn't like that the bones had been removed, others might find that a nice touch. To me if seemed weird. One disclosure I'll make is that there are very few fried chicken recipes that I just love. I was hoping this one would be special but to me, it was not.The sides were really good and if they weren't, the rating would be lower. They saved the day. I liked the corn, the kale slaw, the mac & cheese. They were all good. They were out of potatoes but I hear they're good too.The corn biscuits are mediocre and would have been better if they were moist and warm. They were neither. Still, they're okay with the butter.None of us came to drink this night but my daughter, who had been there before, said they have very good drinks. I like the concept but the execution needs tweaking. We are more than willing to pay good money for a fun night out but the atmosphere is uncomfortable, even ever so slightly stressful.STAFFThe staff were nice and seemed attentive but were not overly kind, bubbly, fun or seemingly desirous of making sure the stay was memorable and personal. I felt a bit like the number they gave us at the beginning as we waited for our table. No one was rude and we waited for nothing but we also didn't need much.All in all, I would say it's a place I am glad that we checked out but I probably won't return.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 1, 16]}, "16": {"description": "Let me preface this by saying I only eat chicken for extreme exceptions...

For an order for 2 people- we ordered TOO much but it was fine for leftovers. Didn't care for the wings but the chicken was amazing. Very juicy, and the breaded part of it was salty and just a good amount. It wasn't over greasy and the fact that the chicken is 'antibiotic-free, cage-free, humanely-raised chicken * non-GMO, trans-fat-free canola fryer oil * Wisconsin honey and cheese * dairy, eggs, and produce sourced from area farms' (information obtained from their website) I was very happy. That's never easy to find and if you are trying to be health conscious while enjoying fried chicken- this is a guilt free way to do it.

I'd been looking forward to going here for a long time and honestly was really disappointed. The only redeeming part of my nearly $30 meal was the honey butter. But that's not really the food, it's the condiment, the dressing for the food. I ordered the 4-piece chicken and while it was moist on the inside, it was overly crunchy--like tooth-breakingly crunchy-- on the outside. Without the honey butter slathered on the outside, it was less than mediocre. Also, they're not fried chicken in the traditional sense, but more like chicken strips. The only piece that had a bone was the drumstick and maybe I didn't read the menu carefully, but I'm pretty sure it said a combination of bone-in and boneless pieces. I was not aware that 3/4 pieces would be boneless. Fried chicken to me is not coated in breading, fried to a rock solid piece and then drowned in honey butter to mask the lack of flavors. It should have been great on its own and the honey butter would be there to take it to the next level. Three stars because the honey butter saved it from being one or two stars. The kale and cabbage cole slaw was so blagh, it was like mayo and kale and cabbage mixed together. Each person in my party of three had one bite and that was it. The general consensus was that it was definitely not good. Seriously don't get this. Zero stars. The blood orange lemonade was alright. It wasn't particularly lemon-ey or blood orange-y. It was just super tart and diluted with too many ice cubes. One star. The dump cake was meh. Too many cherries and not enough chocolate, according to my Texan friend who was with us. I would have to agree. One star. I had really high expectations for this place, especially since the reviews rated it so highly, but I doubt I will be returning of my own volition for fried chicken.

Ordered the OG chicken sandwich and the Honey Butter Fried Chicken Sandwich. Pimento Mac and cheese and corn bread. Parking is fairly easy. No lot but a lot of street parking.

But I couldn't stop with the OG. It's was delish. I didn't put honey butter on that one though. Corn bread is pretty good but small with cute imprints of honey combs on the bottom. The pimento Mac and cheese was interesting. The side was almost too much. It's such a unique taste I couldn't eat it all but I liked it.Then I started to eat the honey butter fried chicken sandwich and I put the butter on it which they recommend. A couple bites in, it was turned off. The chicken was a dark meant like dark turkey. And was so oily. I immediately got grossed out and couldn't eat it anymore.The chicken in the OG sandwich wasn't like that. Whyyyyy? I was so excited to eat to honey butter chicken and I hated it. Read a couple other reviews so stated the same thing as much regarding the dark meat and oil. I was hoping I just got a bad batch or something. But it seems that this is the meat they use.

I wish i would have went to kfc the chicken and the sides are better and cheaper. Dont waste ur time coming here u want good fried chicken go to longman and eagles or harolds chickenFried chicken: (PUT THE BUTTER ON THE CHICKEN) crunchy really crunchy but looses the texture because of the butter on top so a lil soggy because of that. It was tender but not to the point where juicy was coming out. One thing is that the actual chicken is not flavorful. My friend who hates salt was putting salt on her chicken. Not even with addin seasoning and hot sauce made it taste better. I love sweet and salty but this didnt give me the flavor profile i was expecting. The butter made the chicken taste better but since the chicken was really bland u dont really get the harmony of sweet and salty. Pimento mac and cheese: the biggest crime of mac n cheese is using american cheese. nothing ruins it more then the processed cheap funky taste of american cheese. American cheese should be illegal for how bad it tastes. The actual flavor of it was really basic. Nothing special about it picture ur typical boxed mac cheese also no bacon! N the crunch on top didnt help. U can find the best mac n cheese at kumas corner.Creamed corn: i was excited because their was curry in the dish sadly i was mistaken it was basic. U could taste a lil bit of the curry but it needed more. One issue was there was too much mint. The mint completely over powers the dish thats all u can taste. After u finish all curry parts n the mint ur left with a normal basic creamed corn. Grits: this was everybodys least favorite. It was so bland. Literally they didn't put any seasoning at all. I liked the idea of the crispy chicken skin though. Corn bread: idk why everybody talks bad about them i loved them. Their really crunchy on the top and bottom. The texture is phenomenal, it was a lil dry but not as dry as ive had it.it has a good corn flavor then with the butter it was to die for. The perfect combination of sweat and salty Dumb cake: this was awful i couldnt pretend to like it i threw it away. Thats where it belongs in the trash can.

Damn yeah.\" I patted my tummy with one hand as I scraped the plate with my fork, trying to scrounge up the little bits of fried chicken skin and syrup that escaped my ravenous consumption. So buttery, so sweet.The little hipster restaurant was packed, and the din around us crescendoed into a cacophonous harmony that was so constant and steady that it became nothing at all. As I took a sip of the sweet tea, I let out a sigh of pleasure with a tangy sweet splash of lemon aftertaste.\"So, is this better than Roscoe's?\" She asked, knowing that was a very serious question. I really had to think. Which, if I'm even considering the possibility that my meal had compared to Roscoe's Famous Fried Chicken and Waffles, then it must have been pretty damn tasty.\"No. Of course not.\" I paused, \"Maybe.\" Could it be? \"Yes. Yeah it's at least AS good as Roscoe's maybe better.\" Stop the presses, put down your phone, hold on, hold up, WHAT?!Let's back up a little and compare what is happening here. The meal: Honey Butter Fried Chicken and French Toast from Honey Butter Fried Chicken in Chicago. We're talking about a super sweet, perfectly caramelized brioche french toast smothered in bourbon maple syrup topped with two pieces of the ever so tasty HBFC fried chicken. On top of the chicken was a big melty mess of butter whipped with honey (as you would expect) and then a perfectly fried egg.This process starts with one of the more gratifying culinary experiences I've ever known: slicing my fork through the egg yolk and letting that delicious river of golden good cholesterol pour down over the other ingredients like a breakfast crime scene. I then proceed to slash the chicken up with my fork and knife so that I can shovel in massive bites that have every single ingredient in my mouth at one time like a hungry hungy hippo in an oxford shirt. It's an explosion of savory and sweet that just fills my tummy with goodness and sunshine. Did I mention the honey butter? This is how butter is meant to be, and when it spreads and melts on my fried chicken, it makes me feel like I've found a piece of me I never knew I was missing.But asking me to compare this delight to Roscoe's was an unfair question, particularly after I had just consummated my HBFC relationship and was on a total food high. That's what \"Fat and happy\" means. It's not just stuffed, like I ate a big bag of potato chips and drank a bunch of soda and now I feel like I have to pee, but I don't want to get off the couch because uggghh, I don't feel so great and I'm getting sleepy. \"Fat and happy\" means every bite was warm and perfectly delicious and is just sitting in my belly like a hug from the inside. It's when the last ten minutes of my life were spent eating and drinking amazing food in fantastic company.So that made me think. Is this really better than Roscoe's? If I'm comparing taste of the chicken, I give a tiny little edge to Roscoe's. They don't mess around and use any boneless meat like HBFC does. There's something very satisfying about ripping the meat straight from the bone and the extra juiciness is well worth the hassle, greasy fingers be damned. Roscoe's has plenty of butter that gets on the chicken as well as syrup, so that buttery sweetness is there too, but if anyone from Roscoe's reads this: honey butter - do it. The opposite is true of the french toast and waffle contest. Roscoe's waffle recipe is three things, huge, sweet, and amazing. It's a thick and soft pillow of vanilla sweet batter that is ironed into a chicken receptacle unparalleled in culinary existence. No matter if Roscoe's has the best waffles in LA, and they do, HBFC is more than up to the competition with their brioche french toast. Maybe it's the bourbon maple syrup that does it, but the bread is fried so perfectly. It is singed ever so slightly around the crust and a golden burst of sugar fills your mouth with every bite. It's thick without being chewy. It seems to melt on your tongue like a delicate cloud straight from heaven without being soggy.

The 4 piece chicken has 2 tiny breasts and an even smaller leg & thigh. Anyone can easily down this whole order and still be hungry. The corn muffins which cost nothing to produce are the size of a shot glass?

They spice it up and make them taste very southern. The honey buffalo sandwich was great. Perfect consistency when it comes to meat veggie bread ratio. Now, the fried chicken. I have had my fair share of fried chicken over the years and this was definitely in my top 3. Everything about it was perfect. Great crunch, soft juicy meat, and the maple butter made it a delight.

The cheese quesadilla isn't phenomenal but it certainly does what it's meant to do (ie, it acts as a cheese delivery mechanism without being too rubbery or burnt or anything).

Not what brings me back on the reg, but if you have a hankering for breakfast and the place is close I see no reason NOT to go here. Just no compelling reason to pick them over anyplace else.Falafel tacos, though. Damn! Falafel burritos are awesome too but I dig the taco thing more for whatever reason. The milkshakes are also fuckin' baller. The blueberry one is super good. So are the rest, honestly, but the blueberry stands out to me as a slightly unusual milkshake flavor (as opposed to strawberry, vanilla, chocolate - which they have and do nicely) pulled off well.In summation, if you want to enjoy this place: falafel tacos are great; order take-out or delivery; get a milkshake.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 4, 22]}, "29": {"description": "Cozy little spot w good eats.

Out-freaking-standing. Same bun-we'd love to know what they were. The burgers come with a potato side, and we had the best potato chips ever.

Let's get this straight first. This place serves a heart attack on a plate. However, if you're comfortable on your way to heaven via nirvana, then Kuma's is it. This local tavern come burger joint has existed for a long time. One interesting tidbit about Kuma's is that it was hip before it was hip to be hip. The staff has always marched to its own beat, with plenty of tattoos, beards, piercings, and attitude. Now that these affectations are the coin of the realm, that the bar and wait staff have a sort of 'been there, done that' attitude is merely an earned stripe.At one time, the idea that all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands and the ambiance is serenaded with the same probably attracted a certain type of music aficionado. Now, it's just part of the charm. I can't tell the difference between the music of Goatsnake from High on Fire, but I can tell you the latter makes one helluva delicious burger. There is a precision to the execution of the burgers here, from the chewy pretzel rolls to the hand ground high quality beef. You're not limited to beef, either. You can opt for a vegetarian patty or a leaner bison patty for for an uncharge. What they put on them, however, puts these things into the the artisanal territory: poblano corn relish, grilled pineapple, brie, poached pears, fried egg, and the list goes on. There's usually a BOTM or Burger of the Month, which just might knock your socks off with creativity. This month's Deafheaven offered me a burger with a full serving of pork brisket, honey glazed brussels sprouts, and frizzled butternut squash. That was stupid good. You can opt for house made potato chips or fries on the side with your burger. Both are done crispy and just a bit brown. The chips are my favorite.Because you might not get enough fat from the burgers, they offer a sinful macaroni and cheese made to order with add ins from carmelized onions, to scallions, to mushrooms or roasted red peppers. The portions are ungodly.If that weren't enough, Kuma's has been a beacon to beer and whiskey drinkers well before the craze went viral. I love that the servers are well versed in which rotating beer selection might best accompany your menu choice.In the warmer months, you can enjoy your burgers on the patio out back.

I was trying to save my 100th review for NYE, but my experience at the original Kuma's was too good to not write about it. We decided to visit on a Sunday early evening. For it being Sunday, it was pretty crowded. The original Kuma's location is tiny, but mighty. When you walk in, it does feel like you are in a queue backstage at a Def Leppard concert or something. Luckily, the bar is pretty big and we were able to snag a spot there while we waited for a table.  \u00a0 I appreciated the fact that there was more than one cider option at the bar. They also had a few mixed drinks on special. The bartender was very nice and attentive. We ordered some jalape\u00f1o poppers and talked and drank at the bar. I also appreciate the fact that the metal music was not overbearing (unlike the Kuma's in Schaumburg) and I was actually able to hold a conversation with my friends. Lost Boys was playing on the TV, which was a double plus!  \u00a0 We ordered a Mac and cheese to split between the four of us-with andouille sausage, caramelized onions, and garlic. It came topped with scallions anyway so don't waste your ingredient on that unless you want A LOT of scallions. I'm not a huge Mac and cheese eater, but this was DELICIOUS! Enough cheese to stop your heart in 5 minutes. So goooood!  \u00a0We also ordered burgers.

Let's get this straight first. This place serves a heart attack on a plate. However, if you're comfortable on your way to heaven via nirvana, then Kuma's is it. This local tavern come burger joint has existed for a long time. One interesting tidbit about Kuma's is that it was hip before it was hip to be hip. The staff has always marched to its own beat, with plenty of tattoos, beards, piercings, and attitude. Now that these affectations are the coin of the realm, that the bar and wait staff have a sort of 'been there, done that' attitude is merely an earned stripe.At one time, the idea that all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands and the ambiance is serenaded with the same probably attracted a certain type of music aficionado. Now, it's just part of the charm. I can't tell the difference between the music of Goatsnake from High on Fire, but I can tell you the latter makes one helluva delicious burger. There is a precision to the execution of the burgers here, from the chewy pretzel rolls to the hand ground high quality beef. You're not limited to beef, either. You can opt for a vegetarian patty or a leaner bison patty for for an uncharge. What they put on them, however, puts these things into the the artisanal territory: poblano corn relish, grilled pineapple, brie, poached pears, fried egg, and the list goes on. There's usually a BOTM or Burger of the Month, which just might knock your socks off with creativity. This month's Deafheaven offered me a burger with a full serving of pork brisket, honey glazed brussels sprouts, and frizzled butternut squash. That was stupid good. You can opt for house made potato chips or fries on the side with your burger. Both are done crispy and just a bit brown. The chips are my favorite.Because you might not get enough fat from the burgers, they offer a sinful macaroni and cheese made to order with add ins from carmelized onions, to scallions, to mushrooms or roasted red peppers. The portions are ungodly.If that weren't enough, Kuma's has been a beacon to beer and whiskey drinkers well before the craze went viral. I love that the servers are well versed in which rotating beer selection might best accompany your menu choice.In the warmer months, you can enjoy your burgers on the patio out back. Otherwise, there are perhaps 12 tables and bar seats for the rest of the patrons. Unless you go at an off-time, be prepared to wait, because Kuma's doesn't take reservations.It's hella-good!", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 24]}, "6": {"description": "Kuma's!!!!!!!!! I was trying to save my 100th review for NYE, but my experience at the original Kuma's was too good to not write about it. We decided to visit on a Sunday early evening. For it being Sunday, it was pretty crowded. The original Kuma's location is tiny, but mighty. When you walk in, it does feel like you are in a queue backstage at a Def Leppard concert or something. Luckily, the bar is pretty big and we were able to snag a spot there while we waited for a table.  \u00a0 I appreciated the fact that there was more than one cider option at the bar. They also had a few mixed drinks on special. The bartender was very nice and attentive. We ordered some jalape\u00f1o poppers and talked and drank at the bar. I also appreciate the fact that the metal music was not overbearing (unlike the Kuma's in Schaumburg) and I was actually able to hold a conversation with my friends. Lost Boys was playing on the TV, which was a double plus!  \u00a0 We ordered a Mac and cheese to split between the four of us-with andouille sausage, caramelized onions, and garlic. It came topped with scallions anyway so don't waste your ingredient on that unless you want A LOT of scallions. I'm not a huge Mac and cheese eater, but this was DELICIOUS! Enough cheese to stop your heart in 5 minutes. So goooood!  \u00a0We also ordered burgers. My husband got \u00a0the Slayer, I shared the Goatsnake with my friend who traded me half of his Metallica burger. My other friend got another delicious burger, but I forgot the name of it. All of the burgers were cooked great and, of course, were huge and delicious. I think the Slayer will feed someone for 5 days. My favorite burger out of the night was definitely the Goatsnake. Our server at the table was also very nice and was attentive all night. The only slight negative I had for the night was that it was very smoky all night in there (burger deliciousness or fog machine) and after a while my eyes started to burn (since we hung out in there so long).

I know it already has almost 5,000 reviews and all, most which are great reviews, but I feel it best to write an objective review for this location. My friends and I were craving a burger and since Kuma's is down the street from our new place, we finally decided to give it a shot. We started off with a round of Bloody Mary's which were tasty, spicy and delicious. An order of their Mac n Cheese and fried pickles to share. First dish to come out was their fried pickles. This dish and the bloody Mary's may be the only contributing factor to this 2 star review. If it weren't for these items, I may have had to give this place a single star. The fried pickles were amazing. Crunchy, airy and perfectly fried. The pickles were fried perfectly so they held onto their consistency and structure. I believe they use Panko bread crumbs so they were extra crispy. Also the batter stuck perfectly to the pickle. Don't you just hate it when the inside pulls apart from the batter when you take a bite? I do. Next to come out was the garlic jalape\u00f1o and chicken mac n cheese. From the photos and reviews we were expecting some pretty awesome mac n cheese. When I think about good mac n cheese, it's that crunchy crispy buttery bread crumb topping with ooey gooey cheese blend and perfectly al dente noodles. It has the topping but didn't seem to have much cheese in it, felt kind of watery in consistency. The biggest problem was that the cheese sauce they made was completely broken. It had a mealy texture which made it unpleasant to eat. Let's jus say there was plenty leftover. Finally the most waited for and anticipated item. The Kuma burger. It looked so good on arrival but as we eating I was truly disappointed. The bun weren't toasted, too much bread to meat ratio, don't know why but there were bites that were just so salty as if they had not mixed the meat mixture enough that left pockets of salt in the patty. I could only stomach half my burger. What's even more sad is that the fries were soggy under salted and just not proper. Had high expectations for this place.

And that wasn't even because it wasn't a perfectly good slider, it was just because it wasn't to my taste.They consistently update their menu with new and exciting things and while I haven't tried every slider they've ever put out, I've had a large proportion of them. Every time they debut a new slider, I make a point to try it out, and I'm almost never disappointed. My favorites are usually anything involving pulled pork, which many of their sliders include. In particular, the PBJ is probably my all-time favorite - fear not, it's not peanut butter and jelly, it's pulled pork with bacon, jalapeno, and chipotle mayo. That being said, I've enjoyed all of their beef burgers as well, as well as a couple of chicken options (they have an interpretation of a chicken tikka masala in slider form - it's super cool) and even their veggie sliders (despite being the furthest thing from a vegetarian possible).They do a lunch box combo with two sliders, chips, and a drink for $8, or alternatively you can get three sliders for $9. I'd recommend one of these options because the sliders are a little expensive on their own - $3.50 apiece, and you'll probably need at least 2-3 for a satisfying meal. They also offer soups now, which I haven't had yet, but am looking forward to trying!Yeah. I don't know what other words you want me to say.

The Slide Ride opened my eyes to a whole new world of deliciousness, not to mention a world where your favorite food spot isn't a spot, per se, but rather a traveling truck piloted by the nicest girls you'll ever meet.I love the bacon baby (a baby cheeseburger with amazing bacon), the maker's mark mole chicken (shredded chicken with... you get the idea), and the cubano (pretty authentic on a white-bread bun, with yellow mustard and neon pickles). I usually find myself getting a lunch-sack of 3 sliders for $9, taking the whole thing to the dome in a high-intensity, speed-savor-the-flavor 10 minutes, and then passing out, blissfully comatose. They also usually offer some kind of dessert option (moon pies, of late), as well as an array of soda-pop drinks. Follow them on twitter to get their exact location (changes daily, but they've got a few favorite spots they frequent) and if they're in your hood, definitely stop by. If you've got some free time, want to explore a new 'hood, or go for a walk or a ride, meeting up with The Slide Ride at a locale you wouldn't normally visit is the perfect reason to really go \"out to lunch\" and dine al fresco with a paper bag packed fulla burger bliss.

They were horrid places with food so bad that one taste of the gummy, pasty meals ended with them tossed into the trash! We thought, \"Can't Logan Square DO Thai?\"This delightful place, located in a working class neighborhood delivers: both literally and figuratively! We've eaten here over 20 times since discovering it and are happily working our way through the menu. Friends, once taken here, are converted and snag a menu to avail of the delivery service. My Litmus Paper test of a Thai restaurant worthy of returning to are Pad Thai and Shumai; if you can screw those two simple things up, we NEVER return! Their Steamed Shumai is delicate, NOT doughy, and gobbled up within 2 minutes of serving. The Chicken Satay is the BEST we've EVER had...the chicken is actually seasoned so well, you need to debate dipping it in the peanut sauce, which is spot on. Pad Thai is amazing and the real deal breaker for us is their Duck Curry!!! OMG, duck used to be such a standard in Asian cooking; you hardly see it offered any longer. Stated simply: 5 stars for the duck curry, alone!When it's just my husband or one friend with me, we love to eat in the \"box\" seats in the front window...just because it's fun! When we have larger groups, the main floor is the option. The staff is friendly, courteous, and sweet; they never chase you out even when you've been gabbing for hours. The only other sad comment I have is that we've NEVER seen any other people eating in the place!!!! It's ALL take-out when we've gone there. Now, maybe it's because we go from Monday through Thursday and the weekend has more eat-in folks, but we have the place all to ourselves during the week. This wonderful place has now become our Logan Square Opart Thai place to go, and that's the HIGHEST compliment I can give a Thai restaurant! :)", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 8, 12]}, "53": {"description": "It's a dirty crime this place is getting three stars on Yelp.

The pineapple fried rice was also really bland and had pretty much non-existent pineapple.

But we received our bill, every item on the bill was a higher amount. We had to get up from the table and compare the prices to the take out menus i.e. restaurant menus. Everything was priced wrong- everything was slightly higher than the price advertised on the menu. The waitress noticed us comparing the prices and said \"Oh...he raised the prices and hasn't updated the menu.\" Huh? Who's \"he\"? And she decided to wait until AFTER we ordered and drank a bottle of wine to tell us this. I refused to pay anything besides the advertised price. She changed the bill but did not bring us our original receipt showing the changes...hmmm. Basically this waitress hoped that we were intoxicated enough not to notice the slight increase in every item to get a little extra money. Never ever coming back, and I may report them to BBB.

Unfortunately, Best Buy just couldn't seem to get it right.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My old (well older) TV crapped out on me, the picture just simply wouldn't come on anymore. It isn't cool to admit but I'm going to be honest, we watch quite a bit of TV. I was thinking about getting a new TV anyway, so of I went to Best Buy. This experience spanned over 3 different s stores. My mission was simple, go to Best Buy, purchase a television and then take it home. This was not as easy as I would have thought.Store 1:We were greeted by a salesperson, we told him what we wanted, he proceeded to show us a TV \u00a0and gave us a 10 minute explanation of the TV's features. I was impressed and asked to purchase the Television. He disappeared \u00a0for a few moments only to come back and tell me the TV was out of stock. He suggested checking another store or ordering it online. I explained I just wanted to buy it here and now, so we showed us a couple more models, both of which were out of stock also. Keep in mind this is early May, not during the Holidays or anything like that. After about a half hour of being shown TV's they didn't have we decided to try another location. \u00a0 \u00a0 Store 2: Pretty much the exact same story as store one. The Salesperson showed us several TV's all of which were out of stock while continuing to emphasize the fact that you can order them on-line. I couldn't seem to make them understand I didn't not want to order it on line, I simply want to buy a TV here and take it home, I was starting to fell like this idea made me some sort of Jurassic Shopper.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Store 3: Again, hardly any TV's in stock, at this point I was getting very frustrated. The salesperson told me that one of the TV's was regionally out of stock. \"Great\" I replied then you can sell me the one hanging on the wall.\" No, we can't do that unless we have a newer model coming in. Apparently they were willing to potentially miss out on a $600 sale, so they could display a TV they didn't have available in the entire city, not good business guys. Finally, I simply asked to see a list of TV's they had in stock (meaning physically in the store). They did not have one , and directed me to a machine were I could check each model individually (as if they hadn't already wasted enough of my day.) \u00a0I was fed up and was leaving this store without some sort of a TV. Finally, I walked to the front were they had a couple box's with TV's in them, I asked them which model it was on the wall and finally nearly 4 hours later purchased a TV. It wasn't my first, second, third, fourth , fifth...... I don't eve remember how many TV's we looked at but you get the point.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Overall, I'm not sure who the(regional) purchasing manager is or what the business model is regarding television sales, but something as simple as an out of stock sign ,next to the TV's (you could even put available on line on the sign) probably would have saved me an entire Saturday afternoon. However, ordering enough of the product you are trying to sell in order to meet the demand might be an even better idea. Having attentive knowledgeable salespeople is worthless if you have no actual product and if I wanted to order a TV online there are cheaper options than Best Buy. What a headache.

I really like that it is so close to me now, that if i ever need anything electronic I don't have to go all the way to the HIP or down elston by Webster. \u00a0I had hoped for a great oasis , but found the opposite. I popped in a couple days before Christmas as well, and EVERYTHING was picked over. I too was looking for wii paraphanalia (like half of Chicago I'm sure), but they barely had ANYTHING. I really expected it to be like that, so I didn't flinch when I walked out of the store with nothing that I was looking for, but did find another dance revolution mat that I was made by nintendo and not an aftermarket product. (which I was happy about). The guys working there were not helpful or informative...and it just looked so dark and picked over that I wasn't impressed.I had just been to the best buy at the HIP the day prior and got WAY better treatment from the workers and they were still stocked to the GILL with everything I needed. (okay, except for that dance mat)...they talked about how they order lots more than is expected to sell so that the customers were happy. Maybe it's BS, but they had tons of Wii's all the games, controllers, etc I needed, and a sales rep took like 30 minutes or so explaining EVERYTHING to me about the wii and what was needed and suggested games etc. You would think they work on commision with the way they were. I think I'll have to take the trip out to the best buy at the HIP from now on.

For those of you who don't know, a California burrito is a burrito with carne asada, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese and FRENCH FRIES! They happily put the french fries into my burrito and I quickly devoured my burrito in pure bliss. The following times that I went I tried items like Menudo, Pozole, the Tampiquena dinner.

They are hard boiled eggs, wrapped in minced lamb, coated with breading and fried to a crisp, set atop a little bed of greens, with honey dijon and Coleman's Mustard Vidalia Sweet Onion Relish R\u00e9moulade for the dipping. It wasn't something my palate was used to, but at the end of it all, they were really, really good. The crispiness - good. The meatiness - good. The egg - good. The dipping sauce - good. For my meal, I went with Shepherd's Pie. Sure, I could have ventured into something else beyond my usual palate, but I realized that all my life, I'd never actually had it before, so why not? It must be the rosemary and thyme, because I never thought something so simple would be so doggone delicious. I'd say that the portions are appropriate for a pro athlete, so I had to box most of my meal to go. It made me sad to do so.DRINK: Their drink offerings were impressive (to me). I think it was the Blackberry Blossom that I went with, along with a Woodchuck. My cocktail was flavorful, but not boozy, and had I been there to watch a game at the bar, I might have enjoyed another.SERVICE: Our service was fantastic.

Our server was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menus - drink and food. He was also quick with drink recommendations to a somewhat indecisive me.

I also really appreciated the server's patience with me after our meal, when I realized that my Irish coffee (like any coffee I drink) needed loads of cream and sugar. Okay, I'll admit that the Irish coffee seemed boozy to me, but I don't normally drink whiskey, so I can't really tell theirs from anybody else's.OVERALL: I quite enjoyed my visit, and I hope to go again soon.

I was here for a large party and service was just awful. It can't even be blamed on the staff being busy with a large party, because there were multiple servers, and ours was the worst. All the other tables received their entrees approximately half an hour before I was able to flag down our waiter so the people at our table could place an order. We were all in the same party!!! I had a champagne split to drink and the goat cheese/strawberry/pecan salad, which I added grilled chicken to. When my salad came out, it was missing the grilled chicken. I sent it back, and it took more than 20 minutes to get it back. Two of my friends also received their entrees without the extra toppings. Because service was so slow, one friend didn't even want to take the time to send his food back since he was basically starving at that point. Another person at our table ordered an entree salad and was served a side salad WITH her entree salad. It was very, VERY strange. I am amazed one waiter could mess up an eight-person table so badly. The salad itself was very good, but not at all worth the hassle.

I had decided on the banger burger since I knew everyone else was going to get the fish and chips and that I could share. It was a mistake for me. The ingredients listed a demi-glace which I now know is a fancy word for brown gravy. I hate gravy so this was a total mistake on my part.

I had never had bangers before so I thought this would be a good way to kill 2 birds with one stone. So it was a bit of a surprise to receive a burger that had gravy poured all over it. The mashed potatoes on the side with gravy--yeah, I can see that but the amount of gravy on the burger itself really ruined it for me. It made a huge mess and overpowered the whole dish. Although I discovered that bangers are not my cup of tea, I was able to take those off. But when I did take a bite with the bangers on there and the falling apart roll because of the liquid gravy...just a disaster dish. If there were onions, I could not taste them.

I haven't the foggiest how they do it since the folks making the music seemed to be a mixed bag and included a young girl playing a violin. None of them had sheet music.

Everything I wanted was being repeated by her to whoever it was that was next to her.

I wasn't mad at the bar or the kitchen, I already knew the girl on the phone dropped the ball. I feel like that needs to be addressed immediately. I didn't get mad.

What blew my mind was that it was the same jig I heard months ago when I was here. I was a little shocked. They could at least learned some Loreena McKennitt covers, even if they don't have a vocalist.

The bartenders are nice and remember your name, and regulars get a free drink here/there which is always super sweet. The weekend brunch is AMAZING; definitely come hungry on Sunday for the $20 all-you-can eat. The brunch is also a great way to try many of their menu signature items.

They are not a formal lot, I suppose, just music junkies. Lots of strings to be exact. I do love the added wind instruments. Tonight I was alone, and did not care to eat with anyone. I wanted my food to go. I called up the Chief and the woman who answered was not prepared to handle over-the-phone orders. In fact, she had a bit of an attitude. Everything I wanted was being repeated by her to whoever it was that was next to her. My feeling was that she passed her request to a wait staff that was even less inclined to take the order because the girl who answered the phone should have wrote down the order and taken it to the kitchen herself. When I arrived, the girl pointed me in the direction of the bartender. The bartender and the guy in the kitchen had no idea I even placed an order. I wasn't mad at the bar or the kitchen, I already knew the girl on the phone dropped the ball. I feel like that needs to be addressed immediately. I didn't get mad. Part of writing reviews means observing the situation and not responding to it until you have a chance to reflect on what happened later. As I waited for my order, I relaxed with a Blue Moon, and listened to the live Celtic music. I had heard it before at Chief O'Neill's. What blew my mind was that it was the same jig I heard months ago when I was here. I was a little shocked. They could at least learned some Loreena McKennitt covers, even if they don't have a vocalist. Perhaps if there was an actual band with their act together, it might provide the right kind of incentive for these locals to practice a little bit before showing up. Maybe they could at least bring sheet music for everyone to follow.The food here is excellent. Don't get me wrong. I am partial to the Lamb burger on a pretzel bun. My best experiences have always been with the bartenders, but when I have actually dined here, I find the staff to be easily overwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it does get busy here. I just think they could do a half step, to a full step better. All in all everyone is friendly, except for the lady who took my phone order tonight. I just think they need to be a little more aware of their customer flow. As for the phone lady, I think one of the managers need to sit down with the hostess and discuss the idea of taking on roles that occasionally drift outside of her perceived job description.

One of the best pixies I've ever gotten in fact.Oh, and the cut (including a wash) was $18. EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. This is easily over half as much as any other place I've been to in the neighborhood, and for as good or better a haircut. No frills (they won't try to sell you expensive product or offer you a beer) but just a good haircut.I can't speak to any of the other stylists at Orlando's, and the guy who answered the phone wasn't the friendliest, but I'd go back in a minute.

Earlier in the morning I was fixing my hair before work, and I found crazy long uneven pieces of hair due to a horrible haircut that I had received over the summer! (at a completely different salon) I was shocked to find that my hair had been so jacked up since then and I hadn't noticed til that morning. Once I got out of work I decided that getting a haircut should be a priority and I looked to see what salons where in the area. Orlandos was close to my apartment so I called to see if they had availability and was told that I could come in at anytime. When I walked through the doors I was greeted by my stylist Elsey and we got down to business! Things that were great about this place:Elsey asked me if I wanted my hair washed. Not all stylist do this, and then later when you go to pay for your haircut, they charge you extra for a wash that you did particularly need. She really gave me a good head massage when she washed my hair and I was ready to fall asleep!She asked me what I wanted from the haircut and she actually listened to my response. I wasn't %100 set on any particular style because I just wanted my hot mess hair fixed and maybe some bangs. So she gave me some suggestions and we came up with a great game plan. She was the sweetest person and made great conversation. Its always nice to have a good talk when your getting a haircut!The price was suuuper reasonable for a wash, cut, and style. Things you might not like about this place (but I didn't really care to about):The building is old and there were some structural issues. Its not the fanciest, most high end salon you will ever go to but my haircut was awesome so I didn't give a crap. The chairs are a bit strange. They are square and not regular salon chairs BUT they weren't uncomfortable. And my haircut still trumped that though .Over all I'll go back to Elsey because I was happy, and cute, \u00a0and didn't shell out a ton of money when I left Orlandos. And that was my main goal!

I was offered coffee/tea and a magazine, which just makes the experience generally pleasant.However, the list of cons is much more extensive: Firstly, it took almost two hours! That's the longest mani/pedi I've ever gotten. And that might have been okay if it had been higher quality, but when I got home almost every nail was messed up. The polish on my toes was messed up too! I was so frustrated that I took it all off the next day. I don't know why this happened, but I think it might be because of the polish - she had to do way too many coats on my toes because it kept coming out hot pink (I picked a dark red). When she started on my nails the same thing was happening, so she got a new bottle and explained to me that her assistant sometimes puts acetone in the nail polish. Um, why wasn't this explained when I got my toes done?! Could have saved a lot of time! She offered to re-do the polish on my toes but it was already an hour and a half into the mani/pedi and so I said no. Very frustrating.

Although it is the first place I've assessed at below average but will continue to actively patronize.They will continue to receive my business for one reason, the chicken wing appetizer (6 for $2.50).

Bland, salty and institutional (think dorm cafeteria).

Pete is hilarious! \u00a0I was cracking up the whole time we were there. \u00a0He's this tall, gruff guy who is not afraid to say what is on his mind, loudly. \u00a0Which is perfect, because he's really interesting and knows a ton about music, but don't get into a conversation with him about how you are \"past rock and roll\" and then not recognize one of the most widely recognized Bob Dylan songs ever, unless you want a punch in the dick. \u00a0Pete is really fun and friendly, and is apparently also an esthetician, as he offers a \"Skin Tune-Up\" aka Dude Facial.6.)

I use the cheapest old spice 2 in 1 shampoo and use it once maybe twice a day depending on if I go to the gym or not. They immediately started ripping on me and told me never shampoo more than once or twice a week. Conditioner is key. Buy salon grade conditioner and use it once a day. Never shampoo your beard only condition it. Shampooing it dries the hair out, conditioning it will allow the natural oils to stay in and keep the hair smoother and healthier. Hmm... fair enough.The guy cutting my hair then started making fun of my alfafa sprouts on the back of my head. Do you want to know why that happens?

For a Saturday night at 8pm, we were the only people here. It felt a little cold and weird. When I first walked in, I was confused whether this was a lounge (as the name indicates) or a restaurant. There's a velvet-covered sofa, high tops and a back room and it is really dimly lit. There's about 4 flat screen TVs that were playing Reservoir Dogs and Eat, Pray, Love. Very weird combination of movies, I know. I think the staff was playing an early 90s Pandora station. I felt like I was flying back in time to my elementary and middle school days, which made for cheesy/cute dinner convo. I had a good time in terms of the food, but the decor was just horrible. The space itself is pretty long and has a lot of room for potential. It looks like the owner just went crazy with red. There's red tables, red chairs, red signs (that look hand written), red frames of red dragons, and red ribbon they probably got at Party City and hung it up wherever they could. The menus look like they're printed from home and there was only one set. When another group came in, we had to give our menus (we were going to keep ordering) back to the waiter to give to them. Also, I could barely read the menu items as the paper was really faded and the alignment of the words were too left, cutting off the first word of every item. We were literally guessing what the items could have been (\"do you think it's mean green beans? or lean green beans?\"). My bf and I ordered a sangria and a margarita and they were both pretty bad. The price was $7 each, which is a deal for river north or the loop, but average for this area. The drinks tasted like it was purely syrup or synthetic liquids rather than an actual mixture of ingredients. The fruit in my sangria was old too. My friend ordered the tea with tequila and she said she liked it as it warmed her up nicely.My friends and I shared a bunch of food items: vegan steamed dumplings (excellent), kimchi pancake (also great), bi bim bop (just ok but i'm not a big fan of it anywhere), mozzarella sticks that came with fries (how can you mess that up?) and I ordered the vegan chorizo taco (misleading as it is more of a tostada than a taco and still not that great) and my bf ordered the hot dog special of a veggie dog with fries for $5 (just o.k). There's no doubt that the food prices at this place are ridiculously cheap for a lot of food. We all definitely over-ate and we really satisfied with the portions for the price of the food. Because we were a bigger group, they did forget one person's drink order and it took them a while to realize (after being reminded) and bring it out. We hung out there for a couple of hours between the drinking and eating and were treated to veggie soups and 2 (watered-down) shots each. This definitely made up for the really terrible decorations but I just couldn't get over how weird this place felt.

It was nice to have vegan kim chee to indulge in, but as I sampled each item, every single dish seemed to take on the exact same vinegar/garlic taste and flavoring. \u00a0It's as if she basically made the same dish over and over using a different vegetable (or noodles) for each one. \u00a0On top of that, the dishes were all quite cold - presumably from being made hours (or days) in advance. \u00a0Only a few items tasted especially fresh, while the rest of it tasted as if it was refrigerated overnight and then set out to get to room temperature before being served.The service was nice, and Sue makes it a point to visit each table and strike up conversation. \u00a0She really is a lovely woman and you honestly get the feeling that she is hosting you for a dinner party that feels intimate and unique. \u00a0Unfortunately, the food just wasn't good enough to get me to come back again. \u00a0I love Korean food, but I was really hoping for some more diversity in the dishes.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 7, 2]}, "51": {"description": "Come for the vegan buffet.

I had never had Bi Bim Bop before so I decided to try it. I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food so they gladly made it without the spicy sauce, and they made it fresh. Needless to say I was very pleased! The Bi Bim Bop was delicious and I enjoyed how the various vegetables were seasoned differently on top of a bed of white rice, then topped with a nice piece of tofu. I really enjoyed it. In addition to the Bi Bim Bop I also tried some of the green bean crisps (which I thought would be deep fried, but instead were sauteed -- still good though), steamed dumplings and the kimchi pancake. All were VERY good. Finally for my drinks, I enjoyed a couple of their warm apple juice/cider drinks that have rum and cinnamon.

Sounds like a deal to me. There was no one else in there when we arrived around 7pm, but it was a pretty cute place. There was some sweet new wave music playing, so that set the mood of having a good time. I heard that there's usually a lot more people at night since it's more of a bar and open late.

So I asked where they got it or if they made it, and they said they make it in house, which is awesome! I loved my vegan kimchi burger, it was quite a large and hearty portion, and it was on a pretzel bread bun, which is awesome to have vegan in itself. The topper for me was that they had put some avocado on it, and I love avocado. For me it was a hit. The fries were good, they were seasoned a little. I also tried their Bi Bim Bop, it was even larger than the burger and fries portion wise and was quite good as well. You could add your own gochujang to your hearts content.

Basically kimchi with anything is great!The only downer that I had, besides being a little chilly in there and keeping my jacket on the whole time... was the extra charge for the kimchi. I guess I understand if you only order kimchi, but if you have other food I feel like it should be included in the traditional korean restaurant manner. That being said, it really isn't a restaurant but more of a bar, so maybe that could fly?....... no, I still think it should be included with meals.

I also felt that the waiter was very grabby with the menu, which once again validates itself on here, seeing as that was their only pair of menu's and he was trying to grab it incase more people come in.the menu is very cheap. my drink was mixed with the same can of pineapple juice you find at the dollar store. my rice tasted like the same rice you buy in a box. they were also playing the worlds most boring grandmother-movie on the hallmark channel. not what I would expect in whats supposed to be a trendy gay bar.it was just all wrong, I told my roommate \"I could easily imagine this place on a reality show where they do a make-over!\"my eyes are still burning from the unsightliness of red paint and black velvet everywhere!", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 11, 28]}, "10": {"description": "I was invited to come here with a group of friends last weekend and my first reaction was \"dragon who?\" Now I know all about DLL. For a Saturday night at 8pm, we were the only people here. It felt a little cold and weird. When I first walked in, I was confused whether this was a lounge (as the name indicates) or a restaurant. There's a velvet-covered sofa, high tops and a back room and it is really dimly lit. There's about 4 flat screen TVs that were playing Reservoir Dogs and Eat, Pray, Love. Very weird combination of movies, I know. I think the staff was playing an early 90s Pandora station. I felt like I was flying back in time to my elementary and middle school days, which made for cheesy/cute dinner convo. I had a good time in terms of the food, but the decor was just horrible. The space itself is pretty long and has a lot of room for potential. It looks like the owner just went crazy with red. There's red tables, red chairs, red signs (that look hand written), red frames of red dragons, and red ribbon they probably got at Party City and hung it up wherever they could. The menus look like they're printed from home and there was only one set. When another group came in, we had to give our menus (we were going to keep ordering) back to the waiter to give to them. Also, I could barely read the menu items as the paper was really faded and the alignment of the words were too left, cutting off the first word of every item. We were literally guessing what the items could have been (\"do you think it's mean green beans? or lean green beans?\"). My bf and I ordered a sangria and a margarita and they were both pretty bad. The price was $7 each, which is a deal for river north or the loop, but average for this area. The drinks tasted like it was purely syrup or synthetic liquids rather than an actual mixture of ingredients. The fruit in my sangria was old too. My friend ordered the tea with tequila and she said she liked it as it warmed her up nicely.My friends and I shared a bunch of food items: vegan steamed dumplings (excellent), kimchi pancake (also great), bi bim bop (just ok but i'm not a big fan of it anywhere), mozzarella sticks that came with fries (how can you mess that up?) and I ordered the vegan chorizo taco (misleading as it is more of a tostada than a taco and still not that great) and my bf ordered the hot dog special of a veggie dog with fries for $5 (just o.k). There's no doubt that the food prices at this place are ridiculously cheap for a lot of food. We all definitely over-ate and we really satisfied with the portions for the price of the food. Because we were a bigger group, they did forget one person's drink order and it took them a while to realize (after being reminded) and bring it out. We hung out there for a couple of hours between the drinking and eating and were treated to veggie soups and 2 (watered-down) shots each. This definitely made up for the really terrible decorations but I just couldn't get over how weird this place felt. Maybe I have to try this place on their popular buffet nights and I won't care about atmosphere or ambiance or drinks when I'm stuffing my face endlessly, but I just felt kinda creeping hanging out here.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 3, 7]}, "5": {"description": "The Dragon Lady Lounge is actually not closed, it's open!

You get a lot of delicious, healthy food for a really affordable price and you never leave hungry. Love eating here because it accommodates vegans and meat eaters alike.I did have one seriously disappointing experience though: the buffet. I'd heard so much about it and the owner reminded us to come (I think it's every first Saturday evening of the month). We got there early and nonetheless this place was packed to the brim. I'm talking like 80 people when on a normal night we'd be the only two or so people there.Magically we got a table and I think it was $15 but we waited an hour for the food to come out, which was a huge disappointment. There were only a couple people helping the owner both in the kitchen and the bar and it was just a hectic mess with the tons of people, noise, and lack of sufficient seating and tables that forced people who were left standing to be awkwardly sardined next to you.Some people decided to leave while more yet kept shoving their way in the already narrow joint. We, too, were getting restless and super hungry at this point. Finally, the food came out.Insanely, however, a mess of a line formed and due to the location of the table, we were at the tail end. Only one of us could leave so the other could hold our spot at the table but it was still a failure as after 20 minutes of waiting in line, it barely moved.So we called it quits. My logic was by the time he gets up there for food, easily in another 30-60 minutes, I would have to get in and wait even more just for my first plate - at the risk of hardly getting anything given the insane amount of people.I'm not sure if this is the normal crowd at the buffets and if they were prepared for it in terms of sufficient food, but the logistics were a mess.Annoyed by the near two hours of waiting with our stomachs growling, we decided it made NO sense to wait this long and maybe just get one plate worth of food for more money than we would spend on a normal night here without all the trouble.So if you go, don't go hungry I guess and be prepared to overspend when going on a regular night is the real steal, in my opinion.Finally, I hope they are able to hire more help and figure logistics our better so that it's less of a mosh pit with people shoving their way to the long-awaited food.Won't be back for the buffet any time soon unless I hear these things have been addressed, but I wish them luck.

The owner Robert was too rude to be the onwer of a 5 star store and pushy in the way he sells his furniture. If you buy furniture there on a first visit without a negotiation, he might be an ok salesperson but if you say you need to think and come back later he will start talking like a person who does not respect others.  \u00a0My story: on my first visit he said \"if you like it, then take it without thinking. And if you want to think about the sofa at home, don't come back. What's the point of thinking?\"I thought he was joking, the way he talked to me was rude though. The price they quoted was good and Elvirna who I suppose is Robert's wife was very nice; these were the reason for my second visit and also I need to sell my old sofa at home first before ourchasing new one. On my second visit after selling my old sofa: the sofa I liked was out of stock and Robert could not tell me the estimated delivery date. He wanted me to pay him full amount as a deposit for the sofa that he was not sure as to its delivery time frame. \u00a0I said I would think about this and call him later, as a nicer way to get out of the store. He said \"why would you call me later. Don't call me. Just buy something else here.\" Isn't this funny? There are many stores that sell the same sofa (it was very popular model from Ashley furniture). I guess he thought that his store was the only one I should consider buying from, or he was disrespecting me.  At Furniture Outlet Inc. (2337 N. Elston ave. Seach on Yelp and read the reviews) the owner Andy is a lot nicer than Robert and you need not negotiate about the prices because Andy's tag price is already low. In my experience Andy's negotiation-free-tag price was Robert's best price, after an unpleasant negotiation, for the same sofa.

The draft system was clearly not set at the right temperature or was experiencing a problem Their bottle selection was definitely lacking as well. My boyfriend and I couldn't remember if Bells Two Hearted was a pale ale or IPA, so we asked the bartender who flat out told us he had no idea and basically just walked away. I expect bartenders to minimally know what styles/types of beers they sell so that they can answer customer questions.The food was good- I'd say average. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered a burger that came with fries- there was maybe a handful of fries, much less than what competitors offer included with sandwich.

The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired & the food does not adhere to the 'suggestions' made by the menu. Honestly, they can't be much else than suggestion when they so dramatically differ from what I order. A soft open is an understandable thing but how long has this place had its doors open?

Mostly dry bread and berries. To their credit TONS of berries.Coffee was good as mentioned in other reviews \u00a0but didn't get cream on refills unless I asked and then my boyfriend didn't get more cream, just me because I asked.I suppose it started off on a bad foot since we sat down and were ignored for about ten minutes. It wasn't until we just sat looking frustrated and bored that they finally remembered that were there.Was just waiting to see how checkout would be, we got our check and it was fine so gave our credit card and when we got it receipt back to sign it mysteriously had additional items on it. Had our original food but more, so we had to point it out and wait for that whole hassle. And btw his response when we pointed it out was \"oh shucks\".My honest feeling is that they just were not prepared, service wise, for a restaurant.

I was so excited about trying this place since it's only about a 15 minute walk from our apartment and who doesn't love brunch? I'll start with the good parts: it's decorated beautifully and the coffee is delicious. Very laid back vibe, in a good way. It seems like it'd be a nice chill place to watch a Blackhawks game at the bar. Now, for the not so great parts: I ordered the egg white omelette, without bacon. On the menu, it said it came with an English muffin, feta cheese and some veggies in the omelette itself, a cucumber salad on the side, and homemade hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend ordered an \"Eastern European skillet\" which was supposed to be meatless and have veggies in it with toast on the side. When our food arrived, it did not match the menu descriptions at all. My boyfriend even asked \"is this our food?\" Because his skillet clearly had pork in it. But he was reassured by the waiter that it was his skillet and that they \"were changing the menu around\" as an explanation for why our food might be \u00a0different than the description on the menu. \u00a0Umm ok? Seems kinda like false advertising. My boyfriend isn't a vegetarian, he just didn't feel like eating meat that morning but said he'd eat it anyways. He ended up only eating about 1/3 of it - he's not a picky eater AT ALL so it obviously just didn't taste very good. My omelette arrived sans hollandaise sauce, sans English muffin, and with potatoes instead of the cucumber salad that I was looking forward to...I didn't detect any feta cheese in my omelette either - just some caramelized onions and spinach. I didn't bother asking about my food and why it didn't match the description on the menu, but I probably should have. I'm not really a confrontational person and hate feeling like I'm being nitpicky, so I let it go. I normally love breakfast potatoes and these ones looked appealing/super crispy yet somehow managed to be completely flavorless. It was all edible but it just wasn't that great tasting. My coffee cup was empty for about 30 minutes before anyone came by to check on us and refill it, and we had to ask for my boyfriend's toast since it didn't come out with our food. The waitress apologized and brought us some very lightly toasted bread. I'm not sure if this was an issue with the wait staff being inexperienced or if the menu truly is being changed up and there was confusion in the kitchen? It wasn't a horrible experience but it was disappointing. Based on all the great reviews here, we expected more.

Mostly dry bread and berries. To their credit TONS of berries.Coffee was good as mentioned in other reviews \u00a0but didn't get cream on refills unless I asked and then my boyfriend didn't get more cream, just me because I asked.I suppose it started off on a bad foot since we sat down and were ignored for about ten minutes. It wasn't until we just sat looking frustrated and bored that they finally remembered that were there.Was just waiting to see how checkout would be, we got our check and it was fine so gave our credit card and when we got it receipt back to sign it mysteriously had additional items on it. Had our original food but more, so we had to point it out and wait for that whole hassle.

I did some research on Chicago shops like Metamorph and Deluxe--and no doubt they have great artists--but they charge $200 an hour, which I find totally ridiculous. Getting a tattoo is a really important decision and it's nice to have an artist that charges by the piece--something I'm used to. Drawing up a piece can take a few hours alone so....yeah. Prices are totally fair but I was really blown away by the great service.My artist, Marty, is a total rock star. He's got a light touch and a true eye for art--smooth shading, excellent portraits and a whole host of badass tattoos in both color and back and grey. I'm a black and grey girl myself but I would feel totally confident in either medium (Another detail--Marty's lettering is SICK. The best I've ever seen). Marty has a great eye for style. I'm super picky but I found myself constantly asking his opinion, which is a pretty big deal for what has become an awesome chest piece with a very recognizable image (from Smashing Pumpkins'd Mellon Collie vinyl).ILL State is relatively new and I think that's awesome. I was burned by Jade Dragon (who hasn't?) when I was much younger and was really scarred (literally). Marty made me totally comfortable, the music is chill, and I prefer night appointments because they're'really rad. The atmosphere is light-hearted, the artists are funny and there's no need for headphones--Marty's a cool guy to chat with. I learned a lot more about the tattoo process and machines (don't call 'em guns!) and he made sure I was comfortable 100% of the time by laying me back, taking breaks if needed and lots of laughs.I 100% recommend ILL State--these guys (and girl--don't forget Kola!) are totally ill...hence the name.

After that it, took several more weeks before I was called to schedule the installation. At that point I was told they wait till the installation is scheduled before they cut the granite, so I had to schedule the installation for a couple weeks later. Why they wouldn't have called sooner for that very reason is beyond me. I just let it all slide. I chalked it up to how contractors work. \u00a0Finally, on May 13, two months after I first walked into Home Depot, my installation day had finally arrived. I was super excited to finally have beautiful counters! I had been told the contractor would arrive between 8-10AM. They were to call about 30 minutes before their arrival. They called at 7:15, just as I was getting out of the shower, and told me they were 30 minutes away. 15 minutes later they were there. In my hurry to get dressed & get out the door to let them in, I failed to double check that they actually had the correct granite. I had every intention of checking, but due to their early arrival, I was rushing. Certainly an error on my part. I ran back to lock up the pets & get on an 8am phone call I had scheduled. When I walked into the kitchen at 8:15, I saw they had a completely different colored granite that I had ordered. The workmen, who were very polite and professional, tried to convince me it was just a differentiation that was normal in granite. I showed them my sample and even they could not deny it was a completely different color.I called Home Depot in a bit of a panic, but polite. I understand mistakes happen. I also felt terrible for the workmen who had removed the old counter & lugged this really heavy slab upstairs, as well as the granite people (who, at that point, I had sympathy for-- check out my review) who would take a loss, assuming they did the right thing (since the mistake was made when they cut it, long before they got to my door). However, I was now without my original countertop & sink, and highly concerned that they would not replace it at no charge. Beyond that, I had no plumbing in the kitchen, and no idea when it cold be fixed. The person I spoke to, Demi(?), didn't seem sure what to do, but told me that they would contact Stone Systems Chicago (seriously--see my review of them!) and let me know what could be done. They sent a plumber a few hours later to install a drop in sink and reconnect my plumbing just so we'd have something. At that point I thought things would go well, the situation would be handled professionally, and everything to be corrected quickly. Wrong. After that, things went south fast. It de-volved into the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They set no expectation for a resolution timeframe, let alone a reasonable one. There was no communication-- I had to chase down updates, beg to find out when and how this would be remedied. Once, after a days with no update on whether they even located the correct granite, I called in and left a message asking for someone to call me first thing in the morning. No call all day. Eventually I ended up dealing with the granite people myself, & that was no picnic. After one no-show installation, the counters were finally installed June 22. More than three months after my first visit and 6 weeks after the bad install.I've left 2 messages for Demi about getting the temp sink returned, which I think was pretty nice considering they seem to have forgotten about it, & have gotten no return call. I tried 3 times today (the 3rd time looking for a manager to whom I could complain) & no one even picked up! I held for 5, 8, & 12 minutes in 3 departments... Nothing. No one in the whole store picked up the phone.

(In Green Bay, you can find rows of bars on one street with only beer signs, but usually these are \"Pabst\" vs.Old Style). The other Wisconsin thing, besides the stuffed deer heads, is the ease and friendliness and camaraderie, which I think is a most uncommon thing in Chicago bars. Both times I've been there, both patrons and owners are eager to chat you up and editorialize on anything from what's on TV to Iceland, head cheese, the character of French Canadians, or that airline that's now charging to use its airplane bathrooms. We touched upon all of these yesterday. And watched that program on TV where that guy travels the world seeking out strange foods. Not the most appetizing lunch entertainment, but a great source of chit-chat.They serve lunch from 11AM-2PM weekdays only, and usually just a couple of dishes and a couple of homemade soups. My friend James had roast pork, with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I thought I would try their perch fry. Well, I wish I'd had the roast pork. It appeared to be \u00a0very generous and juicy portion. My pan-fried perch was cold and tasteless. Last year I had a fantastic plate of corned beef, cabbage and potatoes which was wunderbar, but the perch, along with the \"frozen veggie medley\" was disappointing. So, if you can go there for a weekday lunch, its best to stick with the roasted meats and potatoes, but skip the veggies unless they making something fresh.

I even raved to people about this place because the prices were great and the food WAS exceptional. Friday, Oct 11th, I ordered for pickup, 2 Kung Bao Chicken (they call it Bao) for my partner and I. The dinner meal comes with an egg roll as well. We got home and began to eat. My \"I'm so glad she is\" picky of an eater partner literally picks at her food and is very particular about how she eats. On her second bite of her egg roll, she noticed a ROACH in the Kung Boa, dipped the egg roll to grab it for reassurance and sure enough, it was a COCKROACH. I called the restaurant right away and spoke to the underaged girl they have working the front counter (I'm assuming she is a family member) and she passed me to a gentleman. He barely understood what I was saying and vice versa but her understood ROACH! He then said \"Oh....okay, we can send you something else, what would you like?\" I screamed out \"Excuse me?! I do NOT want ANYTHING from your restaurant ANYMORE! I am coming to get my money back PLUS I'd like an added extra fee since I did pick up the food AND I'm going to return it for my money, call it a delivery fee.\" He asked me what did I pay and said he would bring it to my home.

Can I please have my money back?\" He said he had to check it but my porch light is a 100 watt bulb so what better light to use other than this one so I told him to check it there, in front of me. He opened the bag to inspect the food, checking to see how much of it I had eaten, and I had put the roach in a napkin, a napkin from my home, because, this place is SO cheap, they won't give you utensils or napkins unless you ask for it, so I had to use my own stuff from home. He then proceeded to tell me that the roach was NOT from his place because that is my napkin. I mean no disrespect to people at all when I say this but my house is not roach infested, we would never allow that here, there would be an exterminator in this house if that were the case so NO, the KUNG BOA sauced roach did NOT come from MY own napkin.

There were 6 to split between three of us, I ate 4 of 'em.Egg Foo Young was really just meh.

I wait another 25 minutes, still nada. 655pm now and I think, screw it, let me call back and see whats going on. I am absolutely STARVING at this point. Same arrogant Asian kid answers. I ask again where my food is, she just tells me its on its way. No apologies, no concern for the customer, no concern for the reputation the restaurant is getting by treating its customers like crap. I told her I was upset that she didn't even seem to care, at least pretend to feel bad that you've made a customer wait so long. All she says is \"well, there is probably traffic\" So at this point I get pissed and I say \"You know what, just cancel the order, screw it\" and she just says \"ok\". THAT'S IT. No apologies, no nothing. I ask why she isnt even sorry and she says \"sorry that its taking so long\" I ask for the manager and she says \"I am the manager\" at this point I am absolutely shocked, I mean I can respect a place not wanting to pay an actual manager to take care of their restaurant but this is absurd. So I tell her \"You obviously have absolutely no management skills and no idea how to treat a customer, the way youre acting youre most likely the owners daughter\" and she says \"i am the owners daughter\". \u00a0Need I say more? Clearly this snobbish, arrogant kid has no desire to do what's right for her parents business. This is NOT how you treat a customer. The worst part is, I asked her if she'd be willing to throw in some eggrolls or give me a discount or do something, anything to make up for this whole issue. She said no. She allegedly consulted with her dad and he said no, to just cancel the order. WTF. I wish there was some rule against treating customers like this, to ensure places like this go out of business.

But my major problem is the service/operations. They'd rather pinch pennies than accommodate you to maintain any type of loyalty from customers. They offer 10% off your first online order, but then the online order program they use doesn't work, so I called and mentioned their online issue and referenced the discount, to which the girl on the phone claimed they no longer offered. Funny, because it's clearly all over your website AND I watched the discount be applied on my online order prior to the website crashing and my order failing. It had nothing to do with them not offering the 10% off anymore, yet she pretty much said I was lying. So I placed my order via phone and came in with the debit card that I planned to use, had their website worked for the online order that their website encourages. There is no $ minimum for online CC payments, and I only placed my order by phone because their online order system was not working, and sure enough when I get there to pay, oh, they have a CC purchase minimum. I was only short of their requirement by less than $2.00. And mind you it's their website that failed, otherwise I would have paid online with my card just fine. I explained that I don't have cash and that's why I preferred online payment. They wouldn't budge to overlook it, and made me increase my order or pay cash. They don't have an ATM. I can now either order something I don't even want, or leave my already waiting order to go find an ATM. Thanks. Great service.

It was total crap and make no mistake RECIEVES NO STARS FROM ME.This is not my first time at a buffet, let alone a chinese one in Chicago and even having gone to ones that were less than impressive, I have ever yet to be so saddenned and simply disgusted by a visit. The evening myself and family member went after they decided they had a desire for a chinese buffet. Upon arrival we paid our fees, and set forth to check out what was available on the line. Almost all the food was cold - not even room temperature. During our short time their, only 2 trays were replaced with what I assume was fresh food as I saw steam coming from the replaced tray. My brother in law had the Pineapple Chicken and General Tso's Chicken which had none of the expected flavor ( each respectively to their recipies) but were instead just both slimy pieces of overly fried chicken with a sugared glaze, no spiciness and the pineapples were seemingly forgotten and omitted from the dish entirely (picture taking fried chicken nuggets from mcdonalds and covering them with simple sugar syrup boiled in a pan). Certain food items appeared to be sitting out for hours based upon their dry, shriveled appearance. Upon picking up egg rolls, fried wontons, crab rangoon and out of curiosity their texas toast - all were so dry on the outside and inside they could be used as hockey pucks, and i'm certain would break glass if thrown. I found hair in the lo-mein and food stuck to the bottom of several glasses over by the beverage area where you go to get your drinks. In addition over at the dessert bar there were fruit and cookies which were being taken by children \u00a0belonging to another set of patrons in attendance - \u00a0whereby they were grabbing them with their hands (not tongs) and replacing food they took a bite out of but didn't like directly back into the buffet tray. The lady working the register watched them do this but said nothing to them or their parents, and at the very least chose not to collect the affected trays to replace them with fresh food since they had now been compromised.

I don't like paying an arm and a leg for something that I and several members of my family can make better, faster and cheaper. I really don't know where they get off on the prices. It's mind-boggling...I went with my family for a relative's birthday because Olive Garden was her choice. Some of us assumed it would be a busy Sunday night, so we went a little early to request a table. We were told there would be a 40-50 minute wait, but it turned out to only be about 20 minutes! Unfortunately, our party hadn't come, and some took a really long time to arrive. Still, the waiters were extremely attentive, the staff was incredibly accommodating and the food came quite quickly. We were a big crowd and we wound up taking about 2 hours or so. We had a baby and the baby made a big fuss and mess, but the waiters were still very considerate.The only downside was the food. I just can't get past it. I shared a plate with my brother of lasagna and rigatoni, and I had a piece of the raspberry cheesecake. Of course the salad and breadsticks were plentiful. The breadsticks were the best part of the meal. I can make a mean cheesecake, lasagna and rigatoni any day of the week, but can't bake bread to save my life, so they've got me there. The portions were just too small for the price, and the taste didn't make up for it. I love whipped cream, but whatever that white goop was on the cheesecake may as well have just been water for how bland it was.

My wife and I came in on a Saturday evening (big mistake) along with our 17 month year old. We came to celebrate my wife's birthday and since we live close by, we figured it's convenient and for the most part good food for it being a chain restaurant. When we first arrived to check in, there were roughly three parties ahead of us waiting to be seated so we didn't think it would be a long wait. The people ahead of us get seated, great! (as I'm waiting anxiously to get seated because I have 17 month year old who is getting inpatient), all of a sudden I see other parties that came in after us and get seated before we do, we politely ask the host, when are we next. The host then replies and says \"we are waiting for a table that can allow us to put a high chair. I am thinking to myself ( I have never heard of this) but ok! So as we wait patiently, we get seated to our table that allows \"room for a high chair\". We look around us and we notice quite a few tables available, \"wtf\". I mean I know it's busy but making us wait when clearly there are other tables available, not cool. Anyhow, we proceed with our \"special evening\", and waited for our server. We waited and waited, finally he comes and introduces himself and ask if we are ready to order. Keep in mind we never got asked if we would like some drinks, water, bread sticks....nothing! We tell our waiter, can you give us few, however we would like to order some wine and an appetizer (The waiter did seemed bothered when we didn't fully order our meals). We had asked for a wine sample and ordered a sampler that included calamari, stuffed mushrooms and pork ravioli. The waiter came back after a few minutes and dropped off the wine samples without explaining anything or taking our wine order. Mind you, we have yet to receive any water or breadsticks. A few minutes passes by and we get our sampler, still no water and have yet to put in our wine order. Our waiter decides to come by, so we order our wine, food and ask for some water. As we start eating our sampler, we noticed that the calamari is not cooked all the way and the dough is still fresh and falling off. We immediately ask for a manager and have them take it back. We get a fresh cooked batch of calamari, good! Our luck is about to change (I keep thinking to myself). We finally get our food, breadsticks and water. Not once did our waiter ever come back to ask us if we need anything or simply ask how's our food. 5-10 minutes into our meal, I look around for our waiter to order more breadstick and water but nothing. It is at this point that my wife and I get up and start packing our sons belongings and request for a to go box and take our meals to go. The waiter still never asked if everything is ok. The waiter comes back with the bill and a cup full of chocolates. I'm not sure if he felt bad and therefore gave us a cup full of chocolates but I have never been given a full cup of chocolates at Olive Garden, maybe one or two if that. We decided to not wait for the waiter and take our bill directly to the manager so that I can provide feedback and explain our overall terrible experience. The manager was very polite and and receptive of our feedback and was kind enough to give us a gift card. I had explained to the manager that all we expect is consistency and great service. Although it wasn't the best evening, we were glad that the manager took our feedback and as a nice gesture gave us a gift card. Now, this is where things get better. A few days have passed and decided to check my credit card transactions. I noticed that my credit card was charged more than what I had approved for when paying my bill. It appears that the server decided to give himself a tip without my consent or approval, crazy huh!. So not only did we have the worst experience, I get robbed from this \"waiter\".

We worked up an appetite and decided to stop in for lunch. We ordered soup, salad and bread sticks. Nothing spectacular. The soup was hearty, creamy and ethereal. Normally, I do not review franchise restaurants like this one, but it is a new Olive Garden and the only OG in the city. Thus, I am reviewing it to give everyone a heads-up on the new OG. This is the Americanized version of Italian food (like Mangiano's or Leona's). When I think of authentic Italian food the Olive Garden doesn't come to mind. As you enter the restaurant, we noticed that the right side of the restaurant was crowded, loud and obnoxious. Also, the bathrooms are located in this section down a long hallway, so you have to walk by customers having lunch or dinner. Tables and booths are close to the bathroom, which we found disgusting. Therefore, we immediately requested to be seated to the left side of the restaurant where there are much fewer booths and no where near the washroom. Also, it was very quiet and we were able to have a conversation without yelling across the table! We noticed the dark wood and contemporary bar. I don't eat a lot of bread, so I only had half of a bread stick. It was so salty that I used the paper napkins to wipe off the salt. The zuppa Toscana is spicy, but without any heat. I enjoyed the soup very much. We requested extra black olives for our salad. They added them without charging us extra. Sweet baby Jesus! The kale, pieces of spicy sausage and potatoes in the soup made for the perfect amalgamation. Service was not great. Thus, the reason for the 3-star rating. We had the feeling that we had an inexperienced server. We had to ask other Servers to find our Server. Once our server returned we asked for more water, extra napkins and more soup, please. My niece loves bread so she ordered a second basket of bread and asked for a to-go bag. Our server disappeared for long stretches of time. He was only taking care of two booths where we were seated, so I am not sure why we were neglected so much. There are maybe nine or ten booths in this area, so it is more intimate, quiet and comfortable. It was fun watching the bar tender creating fancy drinks, and making a \u00a0raspberry sangria. There is one flat-screen TV above the bar, so we caught the latest on Deflate-Gate-ation (the Patriots and their star quarterback). Parking is ample and free, but it is a very strange entrance and exit. However, we left the parking lot on the small side street to the far left of the restaurant. There is a stop light on this small street and it was a straight shot leading us back onto the Kennedy Expressway.

We got a great parking spot and secured our spot in line. We waited about 25 minutes. In that time, we did potty time with our toddler and had him dance around to the music in the lobby. Once we got seated, both of us were overwhelmed by the menu. They really switched up the menu from the basic Italian fare to some lighter stuff and different items. My husband got the baked Parmesan shrimp with pasta while I got the veggie lasagna with grilled chicken on top. Our kiddo loved the Parmesan shrimp pasta and called it \"mac and cheese\" his favorite.Before the entree, we got the awesome salad and breadsticks. The breadsticks were a hit with our toddler. He wasn't fond of the Italian dressing on the salad, but loved, loved the croutons. Both my husband and I ate tons of salad (Caesar for him, Italian for me) and breadsticks. I also downed damn near a gallon of raspberry lemonade. I was so thirsty. Much like everything at Olive Garden, it was another bottomless serving perfect for this pregnant mommy. My baby rolled plenty of times enjoying the raspberry lemonade like his brother did. The service was pretty decent too. For a busy night, everyone was helpful from finding the bathroom to getting what we needed for our toddler to eat dinner.

Of course Paul McGee didn't want his bar to be mainstream like Three Dots and A Dash. Hipsters flood this venue, and it makes you take a second look at the man underneath the beard. Well done! Or should I say, well thought out! What you're witnessing here is a moment in history. During the WWII era, Americans were traveling the world and becoming exposed to different cultures. Big surprise that the young people had a little bit of Polynesian in them when they got back.Turns out Donn Beach and Trader Vic were the parents behind what evolved into the Tiki bar. What's even better is that it looks like they had their moments when their bromance got on the fritz over who created the Mai Tai first. These two people really coined the term \"Beach Bar.\" Enter Bruce Muir, another WWII veteran, brought on the Bamboo Bar, called Big Bamboo Lounge, in Florida. Basically M\u0101ori Mythology was the theme all the way around. This is where Tiki comes in. Tiki is supposedly the first man birthed by a Goddess, T\u0101ne, ruler of the forests and birds. I think digesting this culture through the midst of WWII made tolerating the violence much easier on the men. A mental break. Not to mention the booze. There are variations, but all involve spitting in mud, or mixing water with mud in order to begin the human race. I like the one where Tiki is the penis of T\u0101ne; and the fact that the word Tiki is often associated with the act of, \"Let's get it on!\"Word on the street is that Lost Lake has a \"whisper menu,\" which will serve the drinks that rolled out on the first day the bar opened. I have also heard the menu is always changing. Judging by the grade of hangover I had from going through 5 of these concoctions, I might question that. It is entirely possible that people are just forgetting the creative names of these drinks. I saved the receipt, but I cannot remember which of these I had. I remember the Lost Lake, and Zulu as Kono. Both were delicious, strong, fruity, and ornately decorated with fruit and flowers. I absolutely love how nice our waitress was; and how the entire staff manages to dress to keep the theme of the bar flowing. There was a Peacock chair from the early '70s; and wicker lampshades illuminated the area above the tables. It's really tropical inside, warm and cozy. After awhile, it all swims together. Trust me. The place got very crowded for a Monday night. I specifically went early to claim some elbow room at a table, but I was shocked that it got as packed as it did. It's a toss up over what you need to be more careful about, your sobriety or your wallet. Perhaps both. I left having paid just over $50 on drinks.

We waited for a table for our group and just hovered in a corner sipping our drinks. We had the pool rules and tic tac taxi. Man, are they gorgeously crafted and strong. I was seriously buzzed after one so that's a plus. I felt like I was drinking tiki art. Very cool but a bit pricey. The space can get a little clastro especially since we had coats but I don't see a time this place will ever be dead.

At Three Dots you feel like you're in a expensive hotel tiki bar. It can be nice and maybe more impressive but also more expensive. At Lost Lake you feel you could be anywhere, which is a plus for the feeling. It's lower key in decor meaning simpler and is comfortable.I've been here a couple times, once at the bar and once at a table. Both nights were busy. The other evening is did feel warn in there. AC not strong enough and the front door always seems to be open with people going in and out. They do monitor the crowd and even though it was busy it was not wall to wall people, more like comfortable crowded. Makes for a better evening as a customer and better service from the staff. The drinks are as good or better than anywhere else because the owners & bartenders know what they're mixing, top end liquor, ingredients, & garnishes. The waitstaff is nice and will help you out with anything you need. As far as a tiki bar to hang out at I prefer Lost Lake. This is why it gets the 4 Stars. The food from next door is another story. Overall everything is salty (Drink Up!!). Fried rice, good but salty, Dumplings good but in a salt broth, Chinese hand pie (LOL) is NOT a bao as may be described but a deep fried meat pie with a thin breaded layer, served with some salty soy. The only thing I had that was not that salty were the peanut snacks (spicy peanuts in a sweet sugar log) not bad. And egg rolls served with a watery beer mustard flavored sauce (flavor is fine but it doesn't stick to the egg roll because it's watery, there's salty soy served with this as well)... I didn't try the Chow Fun but I can only guess how this will be... maybe next time. IMO I'd eat before you get there but I know many people that think salty food is the way it should be...YMMVAlso if you're \"Old\" like me and are ordering fruity tiki drinks bring the Tums...

Also, when we got out bill at the end of the night, there were drinks on the bill that we did not order. We showed our waitress and she had added another table's bill to ours.

The exterior had me cackling with the minimal signage and the giant clown in the store next to it. I enjoyed the mishmash of tropical styles throughout the space. It had little hints of classic tiki, Carribean, pink flamingos, silly bright colored straws and neon signs (which feels 80's to me) amongst other things. \u00a0All the while, they were bumping Yma Sumac's rhumba album instead of straight exotica and surf music.

Of course Paul McGee didn't want his bar to be mainstream like Three Dots and A Dash. Hipsters flood this venue, and it makes you take a second look at the man underneath the beard. Well done! Or should I say, well thought out! What you're witnessing here is a moment in history. During the WWII era, Americans were traveling the world and becoming exposed to different cultures. Big surprise that the young people had a little bit of Polynesian in them when they got back.Turns out Donn Beach and Trader Vic were the parents behind what evolved into the Tiki bar. What's even better is that it looks like they had their moments when their bromance got on the fritz over who created the Mai Tai first. These two people really coined the term \"Beach Bar.\" Enter Bruce Muir, another WWII veteran, brought on the Bamboo Bar, called Big Bamboo Lounge, in Florida. Basically M\u0101ori Mythology was the theme all the way around. This is where Tiki comes in. Tiki is supposedly the first man birthed by a Goddess, T\u0101ne, ruler of the forests and birds. I think digesting this culture through the midst of WWII made tolerating the violence much easier on the men. A mental break. Not to mention the booze. There are variations, but all involve spitting in mud, or mixing water with mud in order to begin the human race. I like the one where Tiki is the penis of T\u0101ne; and the fact that the word Tiki is often associated with the act of, \"Let's get it on!\"Word on the street is that Lost Lake has a \"whisper menu,\" which will serve the drinks that rolled out on the first day the bar opened. I have also heard the menu is always changing. Judging by the grade of hangover I had from going through 5 of these concoctions, I might question that. It is entirely possible that people are just forgetting the creative names of these drinks. I saved the receipt, but I cannot remember which of these I had. I remember the Lost Lake, and Zulu as Kono. Both were delicious, strong, fruity, and ornately decorated with fruit and flowers. I absolutely love how nice our waitress was; and how the entire staff manages to dress to keep the theme of the bar flowing. There was a Peacock chair from the early '70s; and wicker lampshades illuminated the area above the tables. It's really tropical inside, warm and cozy. After awhile, it all swims together. Trust me. The place got very crowded for a Monday night. I specifically went early to claim some elbow room at a table, but I was shocked that it got as packed as it did. It's a toss up over what you need to be more careful about, your sobriety or your wallet. Perhaps both. I left having paid just over $50 on drinks.

Patio-worthy evenings in Chicago are not to be squandered.And what a patio it is: large, with tables that can seat any size party from a lonely guy crying in his beer (I don't need your pity; so please stop staring!) to a large group of friends (so large that even the creeps that you had hoped wouldn't attend showed up). The tables are spread out; so you don't have to listen to the guy next to you loudly explain the options he uses to avoid traffic on his way to work, but you'll miss the 411 on what the mail carrier saw when he took a peek into an apartment while delivering a surprisingly generic-looking package. It was noisier than I expected--sometimes hard to hear my own friends. That having been said, the crowd is old enough that their shouting beer pong days are well in the past.I'm a huge fan of horchata, that fabulous rice drink you get at authentic taquerias. It turns out that someone has bottled a mix of horchata and rum, and it's a marriage as happy as peanut butter and chocolate. Tonight, the Rumchata martini made for a delightful, imbibable dessert. I normally gravitate to whiskey-based libations, like Old Fashioneds. My friends tried the \"Old Fangled,\" which adds cherry and orange simple syrup to the traditional recipe. A little sweet for my barbed tongue, but they liked it.If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll be back--whether it's for winter coziness or patio-weather contentment.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 27]}, "35": {"description": "We are regulars at the Orbit Room and are so pleased that young children are no longer allowed.

She spends time there making gals into cute little sexpot kittens for the camera. We took a friend of mine there for a shoot a year or so back and I remember the makeup being fantastic, Julia being phenomenal (and fun, and low stress), etc, etc, etc. So, I was pretty thrilled when I emailed and Julia told me that they actually love doing weddings and she also had a hair girl (Sara). Bonus! And that they'd come to my hotel, no problem. AND that they'd come to my house to do my trial. Could they have made it any better? In a time that was actually a bit helter skelter, the gals at PWC made life sparkle. They materialized my \"vision\" (meaning, pinterest board with random photos) into something I loved. Super simple, but glam. Julia uses airbrush foundation, which gave me a glow that more than one person commented on. Of course, I told my husband it was surely because I was so happy...but really, the makeup job was bangin'. Loved my hair too. Also simple and fresh, upscale without being severe. Sara is a gem! Pretty Windy City was all that and a bagga'chips and thus they are at the top of my list in terms of \"wedding vendors.\" They made the afternoon fun, they weren't frantic or stressed out, they were flexible, they made my mom and grandmother look beautiful, and were all around just really fun gals to have at the hotel that day. Down to earth. Not divas. My grandmother (who I adore) said it was actually her very favorite part of the day, which touched my heart. I know she felt really beautiful walking out of that hotel room, and I was so grateful to J&S for making her feel special. Sara even fluffed up her hair on the fly after she got caught in the rain!

I then called at opening time to confirm the bike was in stock and was already built on the floor. Low and behold, I rock up, the bike is there and the staff remembered me from calling earlier. I tried two sizes before the most comfortable machine is tweaked (handlebars raised, seat lowered) and deemed suitable. I then took it for a test ride and it was bliss (I may have got a little lost on the way, oops). Back to the shop and the guys tuned the bike, straightened the bars etc and I was off! I was also impressed that the guys never hopelessly tried to up-sell anything and everything - they were genuinely interested in helping me with a budget but also ensured I was covered with the essentials. For someone getting into cycling it was also great to speak to knowledgeable individuals in plain English - they never hit me with jargon but also never talked to me like I was an idiot (which may be debatable when it comes to cycling!).

However, after talking to Luis (who is the sales manager) he gave me a lot of information on why a kid's bike wouldn't make my bike riding experience enjoyable. Luis took me to the women's bikes and showed me that there really is a bike for everyone, and adjusted the seat and got me an extra small women's bike. Still, after all his help I was leaning towards the kids' bike..so Luis told me I could test ride both the women's bike and the kid's bike. After riding both bikes I definitely loved the women's bike so much more than the kid's bike; it was like floating while riding! It was so smooth to ride on! When I was riding the kid's bike it was uncomfortable, and my knees were kind of going into my stomach and I was cramped! I love my new bike now, and and so thankful that Luis educated me on bikes and that there is a bike for everyone no matter how tall or short they are! The customer service here is great too!

I literally walked out halfway through the meal. Took five minutes for the server to come over and take my order. Salad was warm...I ate half of it and gave up. Got the chicken parmesan with spaghetti. The spaghetti was cold to the touch and runny. The chicken was cold. I tried to get the attention of the server but she seemed far more interested in chatting it up with the guy refilling ketchup bottles at the counter. \u00a0After five minutes I gave up on trying to get her attention and walked over to interrupt her conversation.

Very dusty and outdated decor. Bland food that isn't fresh but packaged. Overcrowded menu.This place was crowded and I just don't understand why. I think as Americans we will really eat anything. This place is subpar. I went with a group of 15 or so people. 3 of us ordered the leg of lamb with vegetables and rice pilaf. I was expecting a lamb shank. It was sliced meat that didn't taste like real lamb. The gravy was watery, the vegetables were overlooked. Neither of us had the same vegetables. One person's vegetables was undercooked, mine were overcooked, and the other had steamed vegetables. Another in our party ordered an omelet and it was apparent they had the fire up too high because the outer was hard and the inner was runny. She sent it back and that one tasted as if the eggs were old. A dessert came with our special and everything we wanted they were out of. Once I go to the front I saw the cooler that the desserts sat in and I could tell they sit there for days. Another gentlemen ordered baked chicken and it was still white and rubbery. This restaurant is getting away with murder. The food is not select or fresh. The restaurant is old. The cashier at the front told some patrons that she doesn't even work there anymore, they called and asked her to help out.

Fantastic place with great staff and very straightforward service. Open on Saturdays and some evenings for ease of scheduling an appointment. ___I originally sought a new dentist in the city after one of my wisdom teeth reared it's stupid head and started giving me problems. In all honesty, I had been avoiding going back to a dentist after I had a cavity filled over a year ago and it was more painful than I anticipated. I was suppose to have my wisdom teeth removed by the same practice, but if a filling was that painful, could I even handle an extraction? Well, tooth pain has a way of really getting your attention and motivating you to action, so I spent almost two hours one day combing through dentists covered by my insurance, reading reviews, and trying to just will my pain away. I found Confident Smiles through this great site called ZocDoc and scheduled an appointment.The office is unassuming from the outside, but the interior is clean and new. The staff is very professional and efficient, and I was shown to a room quickly. The rooms are all outfitted with TV's and you can watch Netflix or listen to Pandora while you wait, and everything looks really updated. By the time I was able to make my first appointment (I had to reschedule a couple times-my fault, not theirs) my tooth wasn't giving me any problems, but I knew some cavities were probably in there from my last dental adventure so it was good I was even going in the first place. Dr. Barsa has a fantastic bedside manner and is very thorough in explaining every procedure. He answered all of my questions and he made some suggestions on what I could do to improve the overall health (and look) of my teeth, which I really appreciated. I ended up coming back today to get a couple fillings done and guess what: no pain. I got numbed up and Dr. Barsa took great care to get rid of those cavities. He even showed me what he was doing by letting me hold a mirror before, during and after to take a peek. It seems silly that no dentist had ever considered to do that for me before, and it really did put me at ease.

I could feel lighter and breathing was a lot easier and fulfilling. As we went through the massage, he felt some tightness in my left leg and identified another area that needed work. On further investigating, we uncovered that I had a serious sprain 20 years ago on my left ankle, due to which, my leg and the IT band were not OK. It used to hurt me, but I never paid much attention to it. He worked on it and in a matter of 4-5 minutes, I physically felt the relief, my leg was lighter and easier to move and walk. I was able to rest it. I know it sounds funny, but prior to Roger working on it, my leg was always in alert state and ready to defend itself.

What struck me in during the very first appointment was that he was truly able to sense where my struggles were (w/out me saying a word).. He gently worked on me (no pain at all, even though I was very swollen and tender).. and as he worked I felt my body 'releasing'.. fluid, pain, and strange as it may seem, I felt it releasing 'emotion/history'..Roger combined MLD and body movement work in an amazing way.. I felt grounded, stronger and leaner when I left my first appointment.. His work has been amazing, each time he assesses what my current areas of concern are, and spends a little extra time making sure he addresses those areas. I highly recommend Roger.

There are two Polonia areas. Endy's is in the older one at 3000 north, and another newer one at 5000 north on Milwaukee. Back in the day I heard it spread from Division to Pulaski on Milwaukee Ave. Solid block after block of Polish places. That must have been something to see.

Every time I go alone I get Kielbasa since I don't speak Polish, but there are 3-5 different types at most of these shops. Other than Hungarian style they are similar enough that you won't be disappointed. Just read the name on top and give it a shot. Ah, the wonderful pig!

The pupusas were excellent. Of the three varieties - \u00a0cheese/bean/chicharron, loroco, and jalapeno/cheese, the loroco is my favorite. [Loroco is an edible flower... to me the taste is mild and soothing...) I also enjoyed the tamale and was very surprised by how much I liked the croquet! The chorizo was good, too... but heavy and a bit dry. I loved the plantain. I'm wondering if it were actually a yellow banana. Because it was so sweet and nicely carmelized. Mmmmm dessert. \u00a0Yum! Yeah... I'm pretty sure it was just a banana.What I absolutely fell in love with was my juice! The maranon. I was not familiar with this and have now looked up the fruit. The maranon is the 'cashew apple' - actually a fruit that grows along with the cashew when it's inside it's husk so that together they look like a deformed yellow pepper...

The tortilla chips are AMAZING, you can tell they came right out of the frier in the kitchen. Their salsas are also quite good. All in all, the food we had was good. I love how everything is pretty cheap and sold individually os you can kind of piece together your own combo platter for a relatively small cost. The Bad: So the menu has some things that are a little misleading. I ordered this thing that had a spanish description and thought was some type of traditional type of food, and basically it was fried pork cubes on a skewer with bottled bbq sauce. That was rather unfortunate as the other El Salvadoran items were quite good. Maybe it was my fault for not being able to read Spanish, but a 5 star place should be good for everyone.

Realizing that my hometown was no such pupusa haven was a real blow, and the places I've tried in LV and Pilsen are just OK. But El Guanaco is one of my top 2 pupusa spots in Chicago. First, to defend their honor: If you're reviewing this place on their Mexican food (steak tacos and burritos, really??), please remind yourself that this is a SALVADORAN restaurant, so they're not exactly obliged to do that stuff well, and anyway, you have plenty of other options. More importantly, another reviewer said the empanadas here were small/mushy, as were the tamales. Now, it should again go without saying that Argentine empanadas and Mexican tamales should not be expected at a Salvi place, yeah? And while I don't know exactly what they ordered, Salvadore\u00f1o empanadas tend to be filled/fried plantains, so they're quite a bit different. (And it's spelled pupusa, not papusa, which reminds me of papoose.)Anyway, their pupusas are dope, and I usually go for queso y loroco. The dining room is cozy and the staff is especially welcoming. Because I'm a vinegar junky, I'm obsessed with their slightly tangier curtido. But the best thing about this joint (aside from the adorable, elderly server and guarantee of quality novelas or a soccer match on the TV) is that they have jugo de mara\u00f1\u00f3n, or cashew apple juice. I've only ever had the stuff fresh and in Peru, and even compared to that, their juice is pretty damn good.

It offers a nice alternative to other regional Latin-American fare, with super tasty staples like fried plantains and refried beans but also unusual empanadas- my favorite being the sweet milk and plantain option. Really the highlight is the pupusa, which is just another way of packaging a meal into a bread-like substance. Loroco (pepper and cheese) is my favorite filling there. I suppose a pupusa is somewhere between a pancake and Indian naan, and I can't emphasize enough that you gotta eat the pupusa just as it's served to get the perfect texture. The tamale was a weak spot, mine chokingly dry and nothing like the tasty and spicy options found on the streets nearby.

The pastel was probably my favorite. A flat fried cake with steak and potato, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as greasy on the inside as it looked. The chicken tamale was done in a banana leaf so I had high expectations. It turned out to be soft, almost soggy, and I just couldn't finish it. And I love tamales!The price is right.

I'm an armchair beer connoisseur. That is to say, I like to drink beer from an armchair. Given that most bars don't have armchairs, this can only be done at a private home.Enter the Beer Temple. This is a solid one-stop shop where you're bound to find a drinkable liquid badge of your hipster cred to bring to a private dinner party on Elston Avenue.When I entered the Beer Temple, I met a proprietor who is two parts beer nerd and zero parts salesman, which is exactly how it should be. I mean, the guy has a video beer blog that is already on episode #157... barring a career-ending injury to his liver, he should some day surpass Doctor Who's 700-plus episode total. Just to test him out, I tossed the guy a range of hipster-grade pseudo-connoisseur questions (the best I could muster), about the composition of a wild ale, the secret behind the tastiness of beers poured on tap in the Scotland, the identity of a new brewery in planning on Diversey/Rockwell, Belgium vs. U.S. for world beer dominance, and this nation's prior 19th century golden age of craft brewing. He fielded these questions as smoothly as an Anderson Valley Summer Solstice, even though it's only now mid-winter.In terms of selection, this place is to beer what Saki is to records... literally everything in the place is interesting. So many of the better-known and better-tasting American (Brooklyn, Anderson Valley, Great Lakes, Stone), local (Revolution, Goose Island), and Belgian (Chimay, St. Bernardus, St. Feuillien, Gulden Draak) brews are in stock here, but there's a depth of selection for each of these and you're likely to find some other brewers you've never seen (in my case, De Proef Brouwerij and J.W. Lee). While it's possible you might be able to save a buck or so on some of the more common beers by comparison shopping elsewhere, this is a better place to find something new or to fill up your fridge in one stop. In my case, I chose a St. Bernardus Prior 8- at less than $5, a proud sponsor of this review as I'm drinking it right now. And also, a Flemish Primitive Wild Ale which will be my self-congratulatory drink for writing my first review of 2013.

If it's good, he'll carry it. 3) Chris freshness marks all the beers so you don't get any six-month-old IPAs, plus takes pains to order whatever is freshest from his distributors. 4) NO PRICE GOUGING ON RARE BEERS! 5) The entire store is actually designed to decrease the amount of light radiation getting to the bottles. Ask Chris about it. It's geeky, and I love it. 6) There's a \"box of beer of the month\" club (I don't know what's it's really called) that Chris picks out, for a good price. 7) All the prices here are reasonable, and usually lower for the good stuff than anyone else. 8) Chris consistently uses twitter/facebook to update the new releases, so it's easy to see what's coming in. 9) He's very accessible. I've probably abused his accessibility with private facebook messages, but the net effect is I feel like I'm shopping at my friend's store, not a stranger's. 10) Not least of all, EVERY DAY there are a few beers open to sample, and Chris has no qualms about opening up his collection of the best beers in the world. I'll stop at 10 reasons. But I could keep going. The only problem here? The rest of Chicago is finding The Beer Temple, too, and once Chris posts on social media, you have maybe an hour to get a bottle of something he got only a case of. If you miss out, which recently happened to me (I got there in 90 minutes from when he posted about a limited release, and missed it), console yourself like I did: get six bottles of other beers that you've been wanting to try.

How dumb of me.Being from Michigan, I wanted to get me some stuff that I can't get there. Well, I spent about $60 and got plenty of beer. Revolution Anti-Hero, Ballast Point Sculpin, Sixpoint Resin, among other things.While in the middle of looking around, Chris mentioned that he was having a free blind beer tasting -- guess any of the four specific beers and you'd get a free bottle. I could tell that all of the beers I had were probably IPAs, so I was right about that, but without having a sheet of paper with the list of beers in a random order, I had no chance. The whole idea of the blind tasting is a cool idea, and something that I wish places around here would do more of... it turns out I like Stone IPA more than I thought I did.

But when the delivery boy handed me my pizza as I went to get my money, the pizza folded around my hand! I quickly realized that my pizza was not, in fact, in a box at all, but instead, it was atop a flimsy piece of cardboard and put into a paper bag designed to resemble a pizza box. And that water I ordered (which was a dollar and some change) was about 12 oz. of some random gas station brand of water. I know, the concept of bottled water is kind of stupid and I probably shouldn't have ordered it in the first place, but still...The pizza itself was just okay. I guess I wasn't expecting any sort of culinary orgasm with this pizza, so I wasn't horribly let down.

The fact I'm mentioning this here means that Thank You didn't get to that point, and then it's a lot less charming.Since it's clearly a riff on Americanized chinese, let's start there. I thought the egg rolls were quite good. Not necessarily authentic in any way, but well fried/filled and better than average. Same thing with the fried rice; if you're using sourced pork and veggies to make your dish, it's gonna taste better than the average mandarin place.With a good start on fried rice/egg rolls and only a few dishes left on the small menu, Thank You should have a leg up in this review, but things go wrong quickly. 2/3 snacks are close but no cigar: stringbean dish leaves me pining for Lao Sze Chuan or anywhere in Chinatown, while peanut snack is over seasoned. I mixed in about a half-cup of plain unsalted peanuts and maybe now I'll be able to handle a handful or two of these as a snack this week. The cucumber/pickle salad is potentially the stupidest concept and execution for a takeout dish I've encountered.At that point, there's not much of a recovery. Chicken wings are so small that it's hard not to sympathize with every single reviewer on here screaming \"OVERPRICED.\" Keep complaining, as the mongolian beef is meh and should a) fill more than 1/3 of a takeout box. b) come with more than 3 tbsp of rice. \u00a0Noodles are good, but nothing's saving it at this point. We'll see what Thank You does. They could add some new dishes, fix a few others, drop prices a couple blocks and have something worthwhile. But I'm reminded of an experiment Lettuce Entertain You did, attaching a Big Bowl to-go window to one of their places up north. Sure, it was suburbanites instead of Logan yuppies, but they thought they'd be able to parlay an their existing concept into great takeout chinese. It had promise, but was also overpriced and they never put the effort to revamping the idea into version 2.0 to truly make the whole thing work......around the same time they also hired Paul McGee to build a Tiki bar. Maybe Land & Sea will have better luck.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 1, 25]}, "23": {"description": "K, I really want this to work out.

I sadly won't be coming back to Thank you.Another place I wanted to love but the food is all....just....so odd.The menu is quite small so we ended up trying nearly all of it in our recent carry out order. ~Eggrolls - $5 for 4 mini guys - Benton's Country Ham, Drunken Shrimp, White Kimchi, Beer Mustard, Plum Sauce. This one one of the dishes I found to be edible and verged on tasty although it missed it by a hair. Really interesting take on an eggroll with the addition of ham...and actually the ham overtook the flavor but hey, I like ham so I'm not complaining. ~Dryfried Longbeans - $4 - Toban Djan, Puffed Grains, Lime Zest. Maybe these are better fresh out when in Lost Lakes? We weren't digging the flavors on these and neither of us went past a couple bites of these.~Chicken Wings -$6 for 6 - Soy Glazed, Chili Oil, Sambal Ikan Ranggup, Fermented Cucumber. The cucumbers came in three thick cuttings in a seperate little container, unique touch. You can get the wings mild, medium or spicy but apparently spicy is the way to get them. My friend loved these but said Ooowwee, they sure are spicy!~Mongolian Beef - $10 -Painted Hills Farm Chuck, Hoisin, Rapini, Chinese Celery, Coriander, Scallion, Winter Bamboo. I've had some bad mutations of mongolian beef in my day, but this...this is one of the most odd I've ever encountered. The meat itself was fine but the sauce...um...they need to back to the drawing board on it. It's not good at all, has a really strange consistency that sticks black residue all over the container....yea...this dish didn't make it past a few bites for us.~Pan Fried Egg Noodles - $10 - XO Sauce, Mustard Greens, Orange, Zhenjiang Vinegar. This dish was pretty darn bland save for the little meaty bits on the top of it...and there were about 5 tiny little bits that added some good flavor. But...the rest of the dish was just....plain egg noodles. I mean, I ate it, I have no issues with plain egg noodles..but it's not a dish worth getting at a restaurant or for carryout.Final score, we ended up throwing out the longbeans and the mongolian beef, eggrolls & noodles were edible but not amazing and my friend said the chicken wings were really good.

Now the single size available is hearty and less expensive ($10 and larger than the previous $18 large size) than before and has an egg yolk on top. The egg rolls are still small but less expensive and tasty as ever. The Mongolian beef has been super sized, served on a bed of rice and a much better value than before. I wish they still had the original rice noodle dish, it has been replaced with thin egg noodles; still good just not as good as the previous dish. \u00a0I'd also like to see a few other options: maybe a chicken or duck dish.

I ordered the Egg Rolls, Chinese BBQ Chicken Wings, Steamed Pork Dumplings, Chicken and Kimchi Dumplings, Dry Chili Chicken (w/ White Rice), Northern Pork Fried Rice, and Salt and Pepper Squid. It is hard for me to even rank my favorites. Every dish takes your traditional recipes and reinvents them. Each entree was cooked perfectly and the flavors and spices compliment each other. I cannot stress enough how delicious these dishes are and will be back on my next visit to Chicago. I completely disagree with the comments of the food being overpriced.

However, I was short on time and there was a Giordano's in walking distance from my hotel, so I obliged.To think I planned on only having 1 slice! Whom was I kidding? I always thought Chicago deep dish wasn't for me...I'm a thin crust kind of gal, but boy was I wrong. It was so deliciously delicious. My group and I ordered one cheese and one veggie and cheese. I recommend ordering as we did--one solely cheese so you can first taste what it's like in it's original style and one with toppings (or should I say stuffings?). The pizza takes about 25-30 min to make, but I suggest you refrain from ordering any appetizers so you can fully enjoy stuffing your face with pizza. The cheese was ooey gooey and the sauce didn't have that overpowering flavor I dislike in some pizza sauces. One thing I'd like to point out is that the sauce is slightly sweet, but it works!The Giordano's on Rush street was spacious and service was friendly and efficient. If you're planning on making a visit I highly suggest getting there early around 12 noon to avoid having to wait a long time to be seated.

Every single one of them. The people who work there are jerks. They always have a way of making me feel as if I'm a terrible person for walking in there and wasting their time. Like the pharmacist. Not just any pharmacist. The manager. Who acted like he was going to throw up when I asked him a simple question about my prescription. Then he got pretty \"eat a bag of dicks\" to me when I followed up with another question. I think he even sighed. And rolled his eyes. At one point, he stuck his fingers in his ears and started yelling at me. That last part never happened. But the other things did. I really wanted to punch him, which was proof I needed my meds. But that's not even why this particular CVS sucks a huge donkey dick...which, if they did, would actually make them get 3 stars. So, I'm strolling up to the register with a box of Infants' Tylenol cause my kid's at home \u00a0in pain from receiving shots earlier that morning. The cashier scans the item but tells me it won't come up in the system and if I would please go fetch another one. Sure, why not. He was actually very pleasant about it. So, I grabbed another one, and the same thing happened. He calls his manager, who finds that he's not crazy, after swiping it three or seventeen times before realizing that the product has been recalled, but she doesn't know why. Ok, well, I kind of need to know why cause I just gave my son a dose of the last box we bought and it was from here and I need to know if he's gonna get all fucked up and shit from this. But she doesn't know. Tylenol won't tell them. Like some stupid sixth grade secret. So, the bitch takes me back to the pharmacist (she's a bitch later), and asks her which product of theirs compares to the recalled Tylenol. The pharmacist shows me even though I can probably figure out for myself and then proceeds to put the recalled Tylenol box back on the shelf. I'm like, \"what the hell are you doing?\" And she's like, \"What?\" I said, \"That shit's been recalled, bitch. Why are you putting it back. And why aren't you taking the rest of them off the shelf?\" She doesn't have an answer. She's a pharmacist and doesn't know why she's being such a fucking idiot or why its been recalled. She even asks the manager what she should do because she's a robot I guess that can't think for herself. And the manager comes back to show her but I didn't see because I was making my way back up to the register, although I'm pretty sure they just placed them back on the shelf because it's CVS and that makes the most sense. So, back at the front, there's a line like I'm at Six Flags because A: everyone in line looks like trash or foreign or like foreign trash, and B: It smells like gut rot and cotton candy, why I have no idea. I figure I'll just wait behind the next person as it's obviously my turn to go next since this is all CVS's fault and they should graciously accept my presence next. The cashier calls the manager to come help with the line. And she does, flicking on her light, looking in my direction and calling out \"Next!\" The next person starts placing her 700 items on the counter, because it's 7 at night on a Saturday and this slut is going grocery shopping at CVS, but whatever, I walk up and ask if I can go since I was basically next and had to go through all this shit to find a product that might not kill my son. But the manager, who was helping me before decided to be extra customer servicy...to everyone but me and told me that if Maria doesn't mind me going in front of her...but before the manager can finish, Maria is shaking her head and continuing to place items on the counter. I'm shocked. Are you kidding me, CVS? It's your fault I had to get out of line. The manager even said, \"You got out of line.\" \"You're out of line!\" I screamed, and then hurled a bottle of gatorade at her head and kicked over a standee of batteries, punched an old guy in the throat and walked out. When I got in my car, I realized I did non of that except mutter, \"fuck this, drop my gatorade on the floor, and then walk out. I don't even think an old guy was in there.

So obviously I had to try a couple. On my first visit, I decided on the chocolate mint, hazelnut, and salted caramel. The flavors are vibrant, especially that of the cream. I was also pretty pleased with the soft but chewy textures as I bit into them. It was my first time here and unfortunately, there was a small hint of a refrigerator taste on all the macarons I had, as if they had been kept multiple nights in the fridge. Major boo. I came by again for a second taste and I was happy that I did not taste the same thing in my macarons this time. Adult brownie - made with rum. I was so-so about this too since I like brownies being 'fudgier' and this was not so. Chocolate chip cheesecake - It wasn't terribly heavy or hard in consistency but it still tasted like cheesecake. Lots of chocolate chips inside. The cheesecake bottom was a letdown, no crumbly crust! 5 stars for the cake-pops. Love love love them! I got a variety and all of them were wonderful. My favorite is the chocolate macchiato one. The cake is dense and moist and the chocolate covering around it really gives the cake a kick. The red velvet is delicious too. These are by far the best items at Sugar Hills. Customer service is not the best or most inviting. They mostly stay in the backroom working and come out only when someone wants to purchase items.

My two older daughters had baked Donuts, one with raspberry filling and the other one had custard filling. It was so pillowy soft, sweet and had sprinkles! The girls love sprinkles on donuts. I have how the donuts while they were yeast donuts they were not at all fried. It was a great eating yeast donuts that aren't always fried. Healthier way to go I think and the girls couldn't tell the difference.My youngest daughter who is only 3, looked delightfully at the cupcakes and so I asked Jacob to pick me out a chocolate cupcake, it was so pretty with orange and yellow sprinkles. It brought a lot of giggles and a big smile on my little one. She ate the frosting like ice-cream and enjoyed every bit of it.My husband and I had Tomato & Spinach savory croissants. They were beautifully created and the spinach and fluffy crispy croissant that had delicious savory filling makes for a good breakfast/lunch/snack. I also got to have a lemon bar and it hits every notes for a lemon bar craving. My husband also had a baked donut as well it was filled with cream and it was so good!We got two cups of hot medium size coffee and it was excellent coffee you don't need a lot of creamer or sugar for this coffee. I like how the coffee doesn't taste too bitter it goes down smooth. I would love to come back here and order a birthday cake from them.

I showed up and was taken back to the nail room and the staff seemed friendly even though they didn't offer me any water or anything. I assumed maybe they didn't offer drinks to customers at this salon and didn't really mind since I had a bottle of water in my bag. However, the girl that got her manicure as I was getting my pedicure was offered water, and when I had to come back to get my nails fixed (more on that later), the lady getting a pedicure was offered coffee and asked how she took it. Maybe they thought I just didn't look thirsty.The lady who did my pedicure took a grand total of 20 mins to do the whole thing. I figured she wasn't very thorough and rushed the whole pedicure since I was using a groupon, even though that shouldn't affect the quality of service. What's worse: she didn't apply a base coat OR a top coat. When I asked her about it, she said it was built in. It was an Essie polish and I know for a fact that they have neither a base coat nor a top coat built into them, but I could tell she wasn't going to do anything more from me, so as soon as I got home I applied my own top coat. The lady that did my no-chip manicure was nice and very thorough. However within only FIVE days of getting it done (it's supposed to last at least two weeks) the polish on my left thumbnail chipped and even though I didn't pick at it and did my best to avoid touching or snagging it, by the end of the day the polish had almost completely peeled off of my nail. The next day, my right thumb and index finger both chipped. I had not been doing anything laborious that could damage my nails. I hadn't even typed on a computer since getting them done! I had been on vacation lounging around on the beach.As soon as I got back from vacation I called them to see if they could fix my 3 nails. The first time the phone rang and rang and eventually disconnected. It was 1:30pm on a Friday, as in normal business hours...I tried again about 5 mins later and this time somebody answered. I told her my name and the day and time of my original appointment and explained the situation. She put me on hold for 5 mins, I assumed to check their appointment log book, however when she got back on the phone with me she asked when I came in and for my name again then put me on hold for another 10mins. When she finally got back on the phone again she said she couldn't find me so I told her my name again (even pronouncing it as they do in Spanish this time) and told her the day & time of the appointment again and even went into detail about who did my nails and what color had been used (#17 for the no-chip, Essie \"Come Here\" for the pedicure). She finally conceded and told me I could come in at 3pm the next day b/c that was the only thing they had available. I got to the salon just before 3pm the next day, but the girl in the front had no idea what I was talking about when I told her about my 3pm appointment to get my nails fixed. She went back to the nail room then came back out and told me they were with other customers and I would have to wait. I asked her how long and she said at least 20 mins! I couldn't believe it!! I was beyond frustrated so I asked why they would be helping other customers when I was told to come in at 3pm since that was the only open time they had?? She said she didn't know and turned back to what she was doing. I said this was unacceptable and went up to the nail room myself and again asked why I was told to come in at 3pm since it was the only available time and yet they were helping other people then? They seemed a bit shocked and asked me AGAIN when I had originally came in and said they'd help me as soon as they could. As I waited in one of the chairs right outside the nail room, they proceeded to talk about me in Spanish. Little did they know, even though I don't look like it, I am completely fluent in Spanish and understood every word. Meanwhile the girl who helped me when I came in asked for my name, phone number and original appointment time & date AGAIN. To say I was annoyed about the situaton, and rightfully so, is a huge understatement. It was bad enough getting a rushed, incomplete pedicure and not getting the same treatment as their hispanohablante customers, and to have my nails chip within a few days of getting the no-chip manicure, but to then be so rude and continually question my honesty about coming into the salon at all and on top of that take other customers during the only time & day they said they had available for me??!!

I then am moved to a different seat to wait for her to finish prepping her new client. She comes back to me after 10-12 mins of being with the other lady and polishes my nails in 4mins tops.................... 2nd visit was worse than the first. I got an older woman who I'm assuming was new bc another worker kept peeking over her shoulder. I told the \u00a0tech how I wanted my nails and how long I wanted them; she just couldn't get it right. With each \"correction\" they got shorter and shorter. Not what I wanted. She would say \"Ok, I got it\" but never got it. I would tell her to file down a side and she would cut me off b4 I could even get my words out bc I guess she didn't want anyone to hear me telling her it needed to be corrected. Left with hideous nails. 3rd visit.... I know I know..why go back if u had such bad experiences. This place is walking distance from my apartment and I really needed my nails done. I come in and I'm seated immediately. A young boy is directed by I'm assuming the owner/his mother to come over and do my nails... I'm skeptical but, being the nice person I am I allow him to do his thing........ Mistake. Every nail he put on my fingers were crooked. Like, laughably bad. So crooked It looked like I asked him to make it like that. Since it was \u00a0immediately noticed I told him and he would try to hurry and remove it b4 the glue dried. I told him that I've changed my mind and I don't want nails anymore. His mother/owner came over and asked what the problem was, I told her that my nails where not being done correctly. She said she would do my service herself. I appreciated it, but my faith in this place quickly diminished. She asked what I wanted with a snobby tone(as if I couldn't be pleased), I ignored the attitude and said \"I really wanted my nails done, but seeing that I just had nails applied, then taken off, then reapplied, it would probably be best to just give them a break and get a mani.\" She says: \"if you get a mani & nails then you're going to have to pay for it\" ..... This threw me through a loop bc I never mentioned having my service comped or wanting it comped. I wanted to leave with no service done.

It was hard to see items, and often art and decorative items were hidden or tucked behind other things. \u00a0For such high priced items I expected the execution to be more thoughtful.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 3, 30]}, "0": {"description": "I recently used the consignment services of Coyle & Herr to assist in selling an entire household of furnishings which I inherited from a family member. \u00a0I found the owner Mary Beth to be intelligent, personable, insightful and very knowledgeable regarding both home furnishings and collectibles. I arrived with a large moving truck loaded with many different items while dated from the late 60's, 70's and early 80's. \u00a0Mary Beth demonstrated her vast knowledge and business savvy in quickly evaluating, pricing and marketing the vast array of things that I brought into her shop. \u00a0All of my furnishings were correctly priced which enabled me to sell them in a reasonable amount of time. My only complaint would be that aside from Mary Beth the part time staff did not have the knowledge of home furnishings, specifically collectibles to accurately describe and price some of the unique, vintage items that I had in my collection. I found numerous errors in some of the smaller items that I brought in which had been left to the staff to price, and market. \u00a0I understand that the owner of a small business cannot do everything on their own, and overall I was very pleased with the end result of my experience with Coyle & Herr. \u00a0My only suggestion to Mary Beth would be that she hire a staff that is more informed, well rounded and resourceful in researching and pricing of unique items that they're left to handle for the stores clients. Regarding the layout and style of the store I am at a disadvantage because I never had the opportunity to patronize the Bridgeport location. \u00a0In all sincerity I genuinely like the large open space of their currently location and I have found it very easy to navigate in order to view the sizable inventory that they currently have. I have enjoyed browsing through Coyle and Herr on many occasions and with each trip around the store I always discover something new. While I understand the turn over of the stores inventory is very quick, I think a little staging of the furnishings & accessories might benefit the shop while allowing the customers to get an idea of how an item may look in their environment. \u00a0 Finally, the prices at Coyle and Herr are spot on, in fact some items may be priced on the low end of the scale. \u00a0During one of my last visits I was able to purchase a beautiful Cherry wood dresser for the bargain price of $186.- The dresser was from Room & Board and had a retail value of $1400.-. I also found an original oil painting for just under $125.-. In researching my purchase I discovered comparable works by the same artist selling in the $800-$1000 range. Some of the higher quality furniture may be priced higher, but when compared to the original retail value the items at Coyle & Herr are a bargain! \u00a0One must remember that this is a store that is reselling fine furniture from reputable furniture makers such as; Armani Casa, Baker, Bernhardt, Century, Crate & Barrel, Design Within Reach, Henredon, Pottery Barn, Ralph Lauren, Room & Board and many more. \u00a0The store also carries every style and genre of home furnishings from Traditional to Modern, including Transitional, Mid-Century Modern, Scandinavian, Shaker, Federal and Early American to name a few. \u00a0In closing I think Coyle & Herr fills a much needed niche in assisting people with buying and selling fine home furnishings and accessories. \u00a0 You cannot go wrong with consigning or shopping at Coyle & Herr. - I suggest visiting the shop on a regular basis because the inventory is constantly changing. \u00a0- Tom Feddor, Real Estate Broker-Chicago IL.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 9, 5]}, "4": {"description": "Wide selection of unique and one of a kind pieces.

The interior design is very eclectic and adds to the environment, quite avant-garde, yet powerfully classic.I went in to convert my bleach blonde hair into a delicate brunette resembling my natural hair color. Maria listened to what I had to say and what I wanted. She applied it with great precision and she was nice to talk to! Yessy explained what the color application process would do and the varying levels that were included in the mixture. He told me all about why the color was blended and what the current state of my hair follicle was like. He knows his color processing.So, naturally, the hair color was nailed. It looked great and I felt like a new woman. The cut was great and meant for volume. I was asked what shape I wanted, U or V for my long layers. It was great to have some much information about what was happening to my hair. I am untrusting of most stylists.I got an eyebrow wax and the shape was the arch I wanted. It set well with my face shape. I was satisfied.Also, I was lucky to get my makeup done too. The process was a lot of fun. The airbrush makeup was explained to me and what each section of the process was doing. The properties and techniques were expressed and I was confident. The end result was perfection. I felt like a total vixen.

One other hair stylist was there and it wasn't until I asked for an update on his status at 11:30 that she texted him.

The vibe was casual and easy, we really enjoyed our time in the relaxed atmosphere first sitting inside at the high top then when the sun went down, moving out onto the patio. The patio includes server service which is a nice touch though I liked going up to the bar to order myself when inside. Best thing about Crown Taproom - flights! I have a undying love of flights as I then get to try many different things. They have a bunch of hard liquor flights like whiskey, bourbon, etc. But I'm all about the beer flights. You can mix & match whatever you like from the menu (5 oz pours ranged from $3-5) or you can try one of their premade flights which is a great idea. They have a local flight of 4 Chicago beers or a flight of 4 from a set brewery. Both are good options and fun to do for a set price of $12.

On a Saturday night, having read the Yelp about it, I expected it to be crowded. Then again, it was Memorial Day weekend, and I'm sure that some meat hunters had made their way to Wisconsin. It's a bit of a pain to get here by public transportation, but a Divvy from the Blue Line in the summer air was a welcome chance to exercise-off at least a quarter rib. And the ribs did shine. We had the combination baby back and St. Louis style. I still prefer the backs (nothing against the arches of S. Louie). It's nice that they arrive with the dry rub and you can add the sauces to your liking--a choice of sweet, tangy, and spicy (luckily, spicier than most places, and while not especially spicy, with a great flavor-to-\"it's-too-hot-I-can't-taste-anything\" spicy). \u00a0A nice chew to them as well--no pre-boiling here.Many of the sides were fantastic as well. The man knows how to cook fries to a nice crispiness, the mac & cheese had a wonderful au gratin on top, and the cornbread was also the bomb (complete with a tasty, whipped butter). The beans were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd tell you about the cole slaw, but I would have had to kill myself (I'm not a big cabbage fan). Now onto the bourbon. A bevy to choose from (including a Rye, Templeton); I hope a BBQ sommelier would approve of the the smooth Woodford I sipped. Don't expect any other spirits or many mixers, other than the carbonated variety; or any other alcohol that isn't carbonated (i.e., beer only, no wine). But that's fine by me.I like that the counter service saves a little cash on tips, and that one of the owners was there taking orders, serving and cleaning up as well. Very nice guy--I wish that all local businesses demonstrated such high-quality and humbleness to their crafts.Now an aside to you biker pedalers: If you've ever ridden the RAGBRAI bike ride across Iowa, the name of this place (Pork Shoppe) may remind you of the pork chop guy on the route.

On a Saturday night, having read the Yelp about it, I expected it to be crowded. Then again, it was Memorial Day weekend, and I'm sure that some meat hunters had made their way to Wisconsin. It's a bit of a pain to get here by public transportation, but a Divvy from the Blue Line in the summer air was a welcome chance to exercise-off at least a quarter rib. And the ribs did shine. We had the combination baby back and St. Louis style. I still prefer the backs (nothing against the arches of S. Louie). It's nice that they arrive with the dry rub and you can add the sauces to your liking--a choice of sweet, tangy, and spicy (luckily, spicier than most places, and while not especially spicy, with a great flavor-to-\"it's-too-hot-I-can't-taste-anything\" spicy). \u00a0A nice chew to them as well--no pre-boiling here.Many of the sides were fantastic as well. The man knows how to cook fries to a nice crispiness, the mac & cheese had a wonderful au gratin on top, and the cornbread was also the bomb (complete with a tasty, whipped butter). The beans were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd tell you about the cole slaw, but I would have had to kill myself (I'm not a big cabbage fan). Now onto the bourbon. A bevy to choose from (including a Rye, Templeton); I hope a BBQ sommelier would approve of the the smooth Woodford I sipped. Don't expect any other spirits or many mixers, other than the carbonated variety; or any other alcohol that isn't carbonated (i.e., beer only, no wine).

And it doesn't have to be unhealthy---there are plenty of salads and veggies. Still after a plate of salad, most will gravitate to the main courses, gravies, and side dishes, top it off with an assortment of well-made potato pancakes, pierogies and blintzes, maybe return for seconds and thirds, and finally sample the endless homemade desserts.

It's hard to fuck up a crust even though I have eaten some fucked up crusts. This crust is not fucked up at all. This is a hands on pizza. It folds perfectly, dough bubbles around the edges, soft and chewy yet firm. There's a ton of Jumbo slice dumps around. While I didn't order a slice, I can assure you that this would be the tastiest of the Jumbo slice joints.

Their bakery items rotate pretty regularly depending on customer feedback. The bakers are given room to try new ideas and perfect current faves. This being said, your favorite bread might vary from month to month. Some may view this as a drawback, but being a regular customer, I appreciate the effort they take to improve their product. Their items range from typical Mexican sweetbreads, to pastries, to tamales, to sandwiches, to daily french roll type breads, to full sized party cakes. During the holidays, they bake specialty cakes & pastries (calaveras de azucar a.k.a. sugar skulls, pan de los muertos, tres reyes bread, etc.). Although I don't think they are on par with Rolf's patisserie with regards to their cakes, their selection is wide and can satisfy lots of different tastes. Our favorite is the Tres Leches cake (non-alcoholic). Their tamales are good, but spicy. They sometimes will sell a Tamale Torta, which boils down to a tamal of your choice (I prefer the cheese & jalape\u00f1o), deli ham, on a bolillo roll. I never would've thought to put a tamal in a roll, but the cheese with the ham & chiles is a hit! They also have a roll with cream cheese and jalape\u00f1o which is great for lunch.Our personal faves for dessert are their bread pudding (a deal at $1.50), napoleon (which they call layer cake - weird), and their black forest & red velvet cupcakes.

My only major issue that day was that everyone's measurements and eventual size to be ordered was read out loud to the entire group. I'm not shy about measurements, weight, etc., but I found the experience tacky and unprofessional.The REAL problem comes after the fact. My sister in law was promised that the dress order was being processed immediately since the wedding was only about 3 months away at the time. Great. Except that they FORGOT to submit the order for three weeks. Then they repeatedly named a date, all of which passed by with no dresses for any of us. My sister in law was so upset that I eventually began handling all contact with the shop. Three weeks before the wedding, I called and laid out the situation. They promised that the dresses would be there the MONDAY BEFORE THE WEDDING. Some of the bridal party was traveling from out of town, so that was not going to work. I had to \"strongly suggest\" they rush ship the dresses on their dime before the bright idea came to them. After much coaxing, they agreed. The dresses arrived 9 days before the wedding, and some members of the bridal party were forced to get alterations done there because of the time crunch. Never an apology, a discount offered, nothing. I have worked with numerous bridal shops and have never run into problems like these.

Unfortunately, this was NOT the girl I got when I went to try on a bridesmaid dress.I went on a Monday around lunchtime, and the store was completely free of customers. I told the sales associate that I was just trying the dress on, wanted to get measured, and was going to leave the store without buying a dress. She had a hard time with this concept because she told me customers aren't allowed to buy directly from Alfred Angelo and had to buy through a retailer AND that I would get charged $15 to get my measurements. (Two important facts that the girl on the phone never told me. So I didn't really take this sale associate's word for it.)I told the girl which dress I wanted to try on, and she gave me one that was obviously a size I wouldn't fit. And that was the ONLY one they had in that style. So she gave me 2 more in other sizes and completely, unsimilar models, and they still didn't work. And the whole damn time, she was shrugging her shoulders and didn't seem to care that things weren't working out. And the whole time I'm asking to try similar styles in other sizes, she's giving me an attitude and telling me she doesn't know what they have in stock. So after all of this, her solution was for me to get back into my regular clothes, she'd take my measurements, and those would be what I would use for dress measurements. Okay, it was like 30 degrees outside, and I was wearing maybe 3 layers of clothes. I'm no seamstress but I know that street clothes do NOT translate to wedding/ bridesmaid dress sizing.After consulting with my friend, the bride, we figured an alternative solution. I walked out of that place without getting measured and definitely without paying $15. She seemed pretty relieved to not have to do it, too.

Then they actually finish the alterations and take it in way too much. Because of this, the day before the wedding, at Lily's suggestion, my friend picks out a completely different dress that fits in everything but the bust. She has to come in between her rehearsal and rehearsal dinner and finds that they took the dress in not just at the bust but all the way down to her hips and she is now unable to sit in it- they took this dress in too much as well. It would appear that Lily recognized a mistake had been made and was unwilling to address it like an adult, and instead put the blame onto my friend by saying things like \"I'm sorry you didn't like the dress.\" She loved the dress- they just screwed up the alterations. If at any point they had admitted a mistake it might have been a whole different story. She is told to come in at 8 am ON HER WEDDING DAY to get her dress and that 'hopefully' it will be fixed by then. Let me repeat. She is told to come in the morning of her wedding because Lily's did not complete alterations correctly or on time. So we go in the day of the wedding and the dress is still a disaster. Instead of taking in the bust because there was not enough time, they let everything out and we have to come up with a plan to fill the bust and disguise the ill fitting parts.

When my friend counters that Lily never discussed the price of the new dress with her, Lily says that she \"assumed money would be no object because your wedding is today.\" In sum- this lady is a crook.

I don't speak Polish but I've never had trouble getting exactly what I wanted. Even if it did take a little time due to the language barrier.The meat and sausage variety is insane. Casings of about 20 different kinds of sausage hang behind all the action. What I do is point and try to say the name of the type of sausage that is scribbled above it. The ham and meat in the case in front are not to be missed either. They will shave the meat thin for you for sandwiches if you like. There are also fresh cheeses that they will slice for you.

To be honest, I was looking for something cheap and only modestly filling. My first choices would have been the fast food stands on Milwaukee south of Belmont; but at this time of night, they only serve motorized customers. (How can they miss this glaring hole in their service?! How difficult or expensive would it be to put in a walk-up or bicycle-up carry-out window?) There was also the possibility of the newish La Pasadita Express two blocks east on Belmont, but I had had its burrito. I didn't want to eat that much, and I didn't want to spend that much._This_ was the restaurant that was open to pedestrians (& bicyclists - somebody pulled up on one while I awaited my order).Having read these other reviews, I feel I have to note that something has changed here over this span. {Every time I ride on the eastbound #77 Belmont bus, it rolls past this venue. The bus always misses the green light, so it sits here for a minute. I look inside.} I didn't detect any foul odors.I ordered the burrito carne asada ($4.40). It's about 6 inches long. All its burritos are made with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, cheese, & beans. The cooking time was average. The TV was tuned to Univision. There were two other diners in the venue.I took it home. There was a couple of tough, grisly chubs of meat in the burrito. I tried both of its hot sauces. This was a venue in which the mild salsa went better with the burrito.In conclusion, there was nothing either spectacular or horrible about this burrito. It was solidly three-stars. But if its management reads this review, I must impress upon you that you have to improve your offerings, especially now that La Pasadita Express has opened two blocks east from here. Currently, La Pasadita Express closes at midnight. But if it senses there is a market for people in the vicinity wanting a burrito at (let's say) 1:30 am; I think it could easily adjust its hours to go later into the night.Transit options: The #77 Belmont bus runs by here _all the time_. One block west is the #53 Pulaski bus, which also runs on this stretch of Pulaski all the time. The #56 Milwaukee bus ceases running at 9:45 pm southbound, 10:55 pm northbound.", "rating": "3", "date": [2010, 8, 20]}, "19": {"description": "I tested out El Gallo Bravo the other day. \u00a0I drove by and realized it was the closest 24/7 Mexican restaurant to my apartment. \u00a0Thus it was critical that I sample the food to find out whether it was the closest good 24/7 Mexican restaurant to my apartment. \u00a0The answer is yes. \u00a0I tested out my standard steak taco dinner. \u00a0I noticed the restaurant to be more Mexican and Americanized. \u00a0Soccer was playing on the tv despite it being Sunday afternoon. \u00a0Sure enough my tacos came with cilantro and onions instead of the lettuce and tomato. \u00a0This is not a problem as I love my tacos both ways. \u00a0I was not disappointed as the tacos were solid, the meat was well cooked and the service and value were good. \u00a0Add to that 24/7 hours and EGB has a new customer.", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 10, 19]}, "2": {"description": "I've found that bad drunk Mexican food is usually hard to find, but for that, this place is a goldmine.

We have yet to try anything other than a few appetizers and the sushi itself. The maki has been very well-made, the fish has been fresh, the flavor combinations have been well-balanced and the rolls have been on the larger side. Prices are very fair for what you get and they have had a yelp deal as well. The spicy tuna is actually spicy, a complaint I have of many sushi establishments. They have a unique take to a sweet potato \u00a0roll that we found delightful. The dynamite roll has been a favorite of ours as well. The nigiri that has been ordered has been fresh and fairly priced as well. The one thing I will say is that their decorating and ambiance seems a bit confused.

The fish was fresh, the temperature of the rolls and cucumber salad were perfect. The maki was delicious. The gyoza wasn't the greatest, but considering it had to travel in a styrofoam container steaming itself for 1.5 miles and probably 15 minutes before I was able to eat it, one can only expect the crunch to fizzle. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone within a two mile radius looking for fresh, flavorful maki delivered!Now my thoughts on dining in: Atmosphere-- nice, a decent place to bring a date. Freshness of fish: excellent. We ordered sashimi when dining in and the pieces are plentiful and delicious. Servers did not, in our experience, point out what each fish on the plate is-- but we order sashimi enough to recognize them ourselves. Presentation: great.

The first \u00a0problem was they put the warm food like miso soup and tempura rolls in the same bag with a sashimi dinner. I don't think I need to explain the problem with that. Secondly, since there were three rolls in one clear container, we had to figure which roll was which since they were sealed in secrecy from the beginning. Third, one of the rolls was not what we ordered. Fourth, the miso soup tasted like plain chicken broth. They either forgot to add the miso or they added so little it had no taste of miso. Its \"miso soup\"! How can you get that wrong? \u00a0I threw it out. Fifth, the ebi shrimp was had a mushy texture and so highly treated with preservative (tasted close to lemon concentrate but not sure what it was) it was uneatable. One shouldn't expect off the boat fresh sashimi when it is purchased on a weekend. Albeit, my \u00a0sashimi dinner was very uneventful. The Hamachi was firmer than I usually have experienced. The remainder of the sashimi again had a trace of a taste I could not identify but definitely there. Not foul, but more on the preservative side. I've had sashimi in other places on the weekends.

About as true to its national heritage as Chinese American restaurants are to theirs, it seeks to satisfy the pallet of its audience with Japanese style rather than focusing on \"authenticity.\"This is perhaps best noted in the makeup of their rolls as well as their focus on unagi, barbecued fresh water eel, which is a favorite in America as it is a good mixture of exotic, vis a vis the eel, and familiar, vis a vis the savory barbecue sauce it is covered in. Their best rolls are thinly coated in tempura and deep fried. Usually they come with cream cheese in the middle.

Cant believe I didn't turn around after taking one step in the door. You walk in the front door and have to pay right away.

However, the person working at the counter was fixated on this baby, giving it a death glare the entire time we stood there. She maybe mumbled one thing at us, and never looked away from the baby. Super creepy. The atmosphere. I stated this while sitting in the restaurant - and this is not an exaggeration - this is the most depressing restaurant I've ever eaten in. It was dingy, dirty, there was a fly buzzing around our table, and the music was exactly what you'd expect - depressing and terrible. What can I say about the food that hasn't already been said by others - it's just bad. I'm really not too hard to please when it comes to food, but nothing I tried here was even close to good.

With countless options, you can make dozens of mistakes all in one sitting, and end up with no one to blame but yourself.To someone who hadn't done the buffet thing in a long long while, the range of this place was staggering. I think buffets are better than they used to be back in the day. Orange chicken, sizzling chicken, pork scallion, \"pizza (no any meat),\" triangular \"onion rings,\" a weird brown liquid labeled \"beef (for the tacos),\" chicken-on-a-stick, a broad array of canned fruits, a wide range of sad-looking fried fish and shrimp, a small sushi bar with a chef ready to make your order, and all the ginger and wasabi you could want. Some of these things actually looked pretty good, but Steven King couldn't have thought of something as horrible as the \"cheese mussel.\" I didn't chance it any more than I would think of cracking open the door of an abandoned house in the dark when there are cellos violently plucking in the background.I chose just about everything else, with some green beans and tasty veggie lo mein, and I have to say, the food was surprisingly satisfying. I had the real second-class experience of tasting what might've been good when it was fresh. The only real disappointment was the packets of yellow mustard, a watered down version of the typical Asian restaurant mustard that I sometimes use to light my face on fire from the nostrils outward, when I'm feeling a bit down. I brought a book to read, but found myself instead reading the faces of a good sized collection of lone wolf diners of all ages, ethnicities, and girths. The diversity warmed my heart.Some buffets are stingy on the fortune cookies, but this place gives a genuine shot at redemption to even the unluckiest soul. I mean, there's nothing to stop you from piling a heap of fortune cookies on your plate and cracking them all open until you finally hit the one that gives you some hope for the future.

Fried Green Beans. A bit greasy but bright green, crisp and tasty.Chinese Meat Roll.

It's an onion flavored mystery meatloaf (not sure what type of meat... maybe pork and chicken) wrapped in puff pastry and baked until golden brown.

I am not proud to say I like this dish; it's unnatural, oily and without veg, but what the heck. Some people like to grease it up with fried chicken from KFC.

The customer can always know exactly what to expect from one. You can be in the middle of Chicago or the middle of nowhere and they'll be exactly the same. Unironic trucker caps. Tights as pants. Funky razored haircuts with names and designs carved in. Loony Toons t-shirts with matching tattoos. Blank stares. And that's just the employees. Now as much as I'm a student of sociology, due to this, I avoid this chain like a big-box of plague. But I'm also a dutiful older brother who bought some sheets my sister wanted online as an early Chrismanunkahfestivusgivings present for pick up here (to spend as little time in the store as possible). The first thing I discovered is the layout of this store is as creepy as some of the customers. Instead of a nice internet pickup in the front of the store (a la Best Buy), it's buried way in the back in LAYAWAY. Now if K-Mart in general is the second or third ring of Hell (I'm still deciding which one), layaway is definitely one level deeper. Nothing is as depressing as watching someone create a payment plan for $60.00 worth of Christmas toys and there were tons (in weight) of those people here. The staff person was nice enough. However, there was only one of her so the line stretched significantly back into the store. Fear gripped me as I toughed it out for 45 minutes. Then I ate pizza. It kills the pain, it does. And the in-store Little Caesars (Detroit-style pizza, represent!) should have been a saving grace. But this turned out to be the most dirty, least cared for, part of the store (in a dirty, uncared for Kmart). The tables were sticky. And not just in spots. The entirety of tables felt like they were layered in caramel. And the three counter staff (maybe one could be trained on layaway to alleviate the lines) didn't seem bothered enough by this to wipe them down. But oh the crowning jewel was security on the way out. Kmart marks their internet pickup boxes quite nicely and yet I was denied an exit visa from the land of Bluelightspecial because my receipt date (the day I ordered it online) didn't match the day I went. I was forced to go back to layaway for another 30 minutes; where I was told they couldn't get me a new receipt. But they did call up to the front to say I was \"legit.\" Really, security? Don't you have better things to do like breaking up knife fights between customers arguing over whether Dale Sr. or Dale Jr. was or is a better NASCAR driver at 3:00 a.m. (yes, this location is open 24 hours a day, but I fear what the late night scene looks like)?

The fillings were juicy but the beef one wasn't as good as the rest. Our server accidentally dropped the beef one but came back with another one along with an extra cup of the aforementioned chimichurri. Our short ribs were cooked as ordered and very tender. We had no problem cutting the meat from the bone. They came with mashed potatoes which were good but nothing remarkable. The chimichurri went well with these as well, notice a trend?

I ordered beef short ribs and it came with two steaks \u00a0and talk about fat on these things, the first one I ate had about 30 percent fat 70 percent meat, the other was the other way around no lie 70 percent fat 30 percent meat.

My favorites: sweet beef, corn, and chicken and cheese. All three were superrrrrrr yummy to the point where I couldn't pick an absolute favorite. The spinach and cheese was the only one I didn't particularly like. Provolone cheese oven baked - Perfectly hot and melted when they bring it over. It's so tasty with the bread.Marinated eggplant (served cold) - A very interesting dish that somehow reminded me of pickled Taiwanese cucumbers. It wasn't something I really enjoyed eating by itself but when you eat it with the bread, it totally changed my perspective. Better yet, put a layer of the provolone cheese on top of the bread, then put the eggplant on top of that. It's like a perfect little bite! \u00a0I wish they brought more bread initially with the provolone and the eggplant because both were medium to large sized appetizers that really needed to have the bread on the side. Also, we were a party of 4 yet the bread was cut into slices of 3. Thankfully, we (awkwardly) asked for more bread several times and the waitresses were very accommodating. I don't believe we were charged extra either!Drinks: \u00a0We each started off with a mojito of different flavors. My favorite was the pineapple juice followed by the mango puree. The La Negra smelled and tasted very berrylicious and the alcohol kicked in at the end of each sip. I personally would stay clear of the Mala vida - it was like drinking alcohol cough syrup and the El Vampiro - cool name but holy smokes I almost choked. \u00a0All in all, it's quite the random place to spend an evening (note: it's also pretty empty in the immediate surrounding vicinity) but I had a wonderful time lounging around and catching up with friends.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 14]}, "18": {"description": "I love the atmosphere for dinner here.

The Choripan was just plain sad and horrifically sub-par. We shined a light on the sausage and saw that it was still pink on the inside. The onions were practically raw and the bread was left untoasted and chewy. It only came with some chimichurri on the side which wouldn't have made the sandwich any better.Maybe that's why it's so dark in here. So you wont notice all your food is undercooked. Neither of us finished our food and didn't even want to take it home. 3/4 of the sandwich was left uneaten and the server wasn't even bright enough to realize something was wrong to ask.Like I said, we wanted to like the place because of the decor and the upbeat music.

The first red flag was the unholy plethora of items they offer - everything from \"thinner than thin\" pizza to seasonal fruit plates to hot ham and cheese to, finally, a modge podge of different Mexican apps and entrees. With such a cacophony of cultures, it was pretty obvious this place was going to be terrible, but we said \"f--k it\" and ordered anyway; how bad can bad Mexican really be? Well, let me tell you...it was horrendous. They completely f--ked up my order, failing to even acknowledge the comments I left dictating how I'd like my food prepared. And I'm not saying I said add a side of ranch and they forgot the ranch. I wanted a jumbo cheese quesadilla with only shrimp and cheese, and I made special mention that I didn't want guac or salsa or sour cream or pico, either on it or the side (I know, picky, but it's not my thing). Of course, not only are all of those things on the side, and the quesadilla literally placed in the sour cream, but it was also on the inside. To me (and again, I know, picky) it was inedible. It was so disheartening after waiting for so long. But even if I had eaten it, it was wet and soggy and carried the rank smell of a chubby kid's underside after forced physical activity. I would have offered it to a homeless man, but I didn't want to offend him...also, he wasn't around. I would have def given it him - I'm not a monster.P.S.

We ordered the Chicken kebab, Hungarian Goulash, and Polish sausage sandwich. The sandwich was awesome and served with fries. The real treat was the Goulash which was prepared with a sweet paprika and red pepper (sweet) sauce. It was not the typical spicy Hungarian Goulash, but the sauce was so good we wiped the plate clean. The chicken kebab came as two large skewers served with potato wedges and a mix of Central European cold salads. The chicken was lightly seasoned and tasted great. The staff were friendly and the little blond woman who runs the place was very helpful. She said they have been open just a little while and that they are not cooking everything they have on the menu. I suggest you ask for the \"specials\" and see what the cook has going on.

NO, I mean I don't know about you but I can't eat when I am smelling sewage.So we decided to try it one last time; again on a Tuesday morning. The second time we walk in and I swear we could still smell that odor but we decided to stay. We all changed up our order and this is no joke but our waitress really smelled. She seemed a bit slow and didn't give us anything that we ordered. 2 of us had to send back our food because it was wrong. I changed what I usually order and ordered a vegetable omelet; it came back with some sauce and when I asked her what this sauce was and what was in it she said \"nothing,\"...Nothing?

It's nice (and strangely comforting...) to see the same people working every time we go. They have a pool table and several small televisions, in case you're not into the karaoke thing. The beer selection is moderate and inexpensive, so it keeps the snobs away. The crowd is a laid-back, fun mix of people who are out to have a good time. You'll probably make a new friend or two every time you go. Things to know1. There is a buzzer by the door, and you have to get buzzed in. Don't get confused about it. Just push the button, and they'll unlock it for you...unless you're a creeper, which is probably the point. 2. If you're going for karaoke (and you probably are), get there early in the evening so you have time to sing a couple songs before it gets really busy. Once there are 40 people in the rotation, it takes a while to get to your song. Be patient. No need to hover over the table giving disapproving glances to Fred. He has a fair system.3. Don't forget to tip! You probably know to tip the bartenders, but tip the karaoke guy, too. It's customary, especially if he's making it fun for you and playing your songs. Don't be surprised when he pulls out props to enhance your performance or sings a little to help you get back on track when you're too drunk to sing the song.

Using the receipt, we've been working \u00a0backward to try to piece together what exactly transpired last night. It's like Memento over here. The only possible conclusion is that we did indeed patron the Golden Nugget in Logan Square at approximately 1:45am this morning. We'll start with what we know. Last night was New Year's Eve. We received free tickets to State & Madison and Local H at The Bottom Lounge. With Local H headlining, we were at least momentarily sure we were ringing in New Year's 1998. There was an open bar. Free cocktails, wine, champagne, and Schlitz beer -- classy all the way around. And that's the last thing we remember.Austin vaguely recalls trying to convince everyone on our CTA blue line bus, including the driver, to join us for late-night breakfast at Golden Nugget. Apparently there was one taker, a drunk guy at the back of the bus, but we must have lost him during transit because we have no recollection of him actually making it to the restaurant. He's likely still wondering down Western trying to find pancakes. We use the term \"restaurant\" loosely. It's pretty dank in the Golden Nugget Pancake House. Imagine an IHOP unbeholden to any sort of national standards, or imagine any regular Denny's. The d\u00e9cor is 70s diner, with wood paneling accents, and what seems to be a thin layer of butter covering the entire establishment. It's surely a fire hazard.According to our receipt, someone ordered biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs sunny side up for $6.50. Austin thinks it might have been his order and says of the meal, \"I think it was probably pretty good.\" Hawley ordered a side of hash browns and one pancake for a total of $4.00. We propose rewording the menu to call it an order of butter with a side of pancake. Alex and Carolina split a side of biscuits and gravy and a \"Pancake Sandwich\" for a total of $10.00. Don't be fooled by the name -- Golden Nugget's \"Pancake Sandwich\" is terribly misleading (the fine print should read: \"some assembly required\"). The \"sandwich\" consisted of a stack of three pancakes, and on a separate plate, 3 eggs cooked to your choosing. Had Alex and Carolina known they were going to be assembling the Pancake Sandwich themselves, they might have ordered something else. Disappointed but resilient as always, Alex scraped the over-easy eggs onto the top of the pancake platter and went to work. At one point during the meal, Alex may have claimed that Golden Nugget's pancakes are the \"best pancakes ever in the world.\" In retrospect, that may have been a bold statement, but we're sure the pancakes were pretty awesome at the time.The service at Golden Nugget is exceptional. With a clientele of mostly drunken college students and prostitutes, the staff manages to treat every customer with attention while keeping Golden Nugget from turning into the hellhole it has every right to be. During a questioning session of our young waitress regarding just \"what makes the pancakes so damn good,\" we learned that she is a single mother working holidays to make some extra money. With a hardworking mom like her, that kid of hers is in good hands. Our one piece of advice to the new mom? Don't ever let her kid grow up to be the kind of person who would willingly eat at Golden Nugget.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 1, 1]}, "29": {"description": "Been here a couple times.

It's been around a long time, and it is directly on the SW corner of Belmont & Kimball, across the street from the Blue Line \"L\" station, but I had not eaten any of its food.I have had the hot dog, and yesterday I had the polish. The sausages here are from 'Red Hot Chicago', which used to be the Samuel Ladany Sausage Company a quarter-century ago. The hot dog is a ten. Toppings for sausages are mustard, relish, diced raw onions, tomatoes, and sport peppers. You will probably get all of them on your sausage, even if you try to specify omitting one or more. (I think yesterday, we had a new grill guy whose comprehension of English was lousy. I am pretty certain that was the venue's owner instructing him. But my request to hold the peppers and the tomatoes went unheeded.) Prices are average. The polish \"meal deal\" (which includes french fries _and_ a soda) was $5.00 [incl. tax]. (\"Combo\"'s here are not beef & sausage sandwiches - they're a sandwich and french fries.) It was not explicitly stated, but I suspect this 'polish' was all-beef.It was an average polish. Not as deeply cooked as the one at Express Grill, but it had some snap. Raw diced onions are not as tasty as grilled onions, in my vista. The fries are institutional. It should change the fryer oil more frequently, because most of them will come out hot (in temperature) and crunchy. Too crunchy. If you order something which does not include french fries, you can buy a small order of them for $1.45, or a large order of them for $1.50.

The difference between this place and other Mexican stores is that they allow you to pick and choose how much barbacoa or carnitas you want. You don't have to wait for the butcher to pick it for you. This is a bonus for me because I like to choose what parts of the barbacoa or carnitas I want. So I got in line and waited patiently until it was my turn. I was there for the barbacoa but next time I'll get some carnitas since they did look good as well. Once I got up to the counter I was happy to see that the barbacoa was mexico city style and I was excited to get some. I got a pound of choice pieces and picked up the house made salsa.

Instead of replacing the couch they had someone come and fix it just in time for Christmas - looks ok now but I thought I was buying a brand new, perfect condition couch for $1400. Oh and when the bed was finally delivered, it arrived completely unassembled in 2 boxes marked Made in China... I thought I was buying custom. If I'd have known I was getting an unassembled bed from China I'd have just bought it online for half the price instead of waiting more than 3 months to get.

Definitely do your homework and look around a bit, but Far Below Retail could be your best bet. Having just moved to Chicago, I was daunted by the prospect of furnishing my 1-bedroom River North apartment. After scouring through Craigslist (including viewings), IKEA.com, and a bunch of other furniture store websites for a couch, I was feeling exasperated. I was even ready to head out to the suburbs to check out a mega furniture store or two (or three). Then I chanced upon FBR through Yelp. Since it was only a short walk away, I thought I'd try my luck. I had been warned about sleazy furniture salespeople in general, so I put on my \"the world is out to screw me but I won't let them\" cap. Bring it on. Thanks to Erin and Tony, I did not end up with battle scars that would stay with me for life. In fact, it was a very pleasant shopping experience altogether! They were willing to help me work within my budget, and did not hover or push sales while my mom and I were going through the catalog and testing out various couches. There had been an Ashley couch that I'd seen online that had looked promising, but it turned out to be uncomfortable. Arghhh... Then I came across a couch that I liked (a gorgeous chocolate brown recliner loveseat). Much to my dismay, it exceeded my price range by quite a bit. When I expressed my concern, Erin/Tony suggested that I take the (2 month old) floor model for a reduced price. Still above my budget so they threw in the pillows too. They also said it could be delivered the next day. Ok, DEAL. My thinking was that if I was going to sit on it for the next few years, I might as well invest... I kept my fingers crossed the next 24 hours awhile I waited for my couch, but it turned out I didn't need to do that. The movers arrived slightly ahead of schedule and I didn't need to lift a finger. Done!Now, a few days later, I absolutely love my couch and am so happy I decided to invest in it!

If they served food like this IN their restaurant they'd be out of business in a week. The food is very over priced for what you receive. I ordered a burger and chicken tenders. The total cost was $32.74. They sent over wings instead of tenders, and the wrong burger as well. Both items were ice cold and looked like they were assembled for an inner-city school lunch program. I called to let them know my order was wrong and was met with a lot of arguing. The woman who answered the phone was annoyed with me before I even started speaking, and argued with me about the mistakes in the order until she eventually said \"How is that my problem?,\" and handed the phone to her manager. The manger was flustered and incompetent, and had me sit on the phone with him for five minutes until he could finally wrap his brain around my issue. He said he would refund me but that it would take a few days. He did not try to correct the order or even ask if I wanted new food. Remember, these isn't a \u00a0\"fast food\" establishment.

Free beer tour, with free beer. Yes, you read that right. Not only was the Revolution tour probably the best brewery tour I've been on in terms of my interest in the information they are sharing, it's also the cheapest (free), and it also gave me a free beer. Literally what more do you want. Tours are at 3, 4, 5, and 6 pm on Saturdays, and on other days but I don't know the times.2. Cheap beer. Ok, so maybe you didn't get on a tour. Well, sucks for you that you didn't get to learn about beer, but that's really all that sucks, because now you can just pretend you came for a tasting. Most beers are available as samples for $2, and the beers range from $4-$8 in price which is incredibly reasonable. Get drunk with your friends.3. BYOF.

Fist City is one of my favorite beers, in general, of all time, say what you will about my tastes. Revolution Rosa is so summery. A Little Crazy was totally wonderful on the tour.Revolution is so Chicago, but I want them to distribute and be amazing so that I can have their beer wherever I am in the US.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 26]}, "13": {"description": "I am having a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. Some aspects of the brewery such as the tour and atmosphere are probably worth four stars since I really enjoyed myself while I was there. Of the nine different beers that I tried there were some that disappointed me and since they are a brewery that could drop them down to three. I think that part of the problem is that a couple beers that I expected to enjoy were the ones that let me down. I won't cover all the beers but I'll talk about the ones that I remember best.My favorite beer was the Chicago Common because it was well balanced and tasted good. It was an easy drinking beer that still had plenty of flavor and convinced me to switch from tasting size to pint and would be a great anytime or everyday beer. I also enjoyed the Bottom Up Wit which was a good version of a Belgian wheat and The Whip which is a wheat IPA. The Citra Hero was also a good IPA and enjoyable beer. Rosa, the hibiscus ale, was okay but the hibiscus flavor was of course noticeable and added a non-hoppy bitterness that I wasn't a big fan of. The beer that surprised me and not for a good reason was the Riot pilsner because I normally like pilsner but this one is quite sweet (really just way too sweet for a pilsner) and did not make me think of any pilsner I have tasted before. I also found the Two Barrel Billy barrel-aged scotch ale too be way too heavy for me. Maybe the style is just not for me but it was just so sweet and overpowering that it was hard to drink. This is definitely a slow sipping beer.The tour gave a nice opportunity to see the production facility which was a lot larger than many of the other craft breweries I have toured. A free full beer was provided during the tour which is awesome! The tour guide was very informative but his attitude made you feel like he really didn't want to be giving us the tour. He even announced at the beginning that it usually lasts 45 minutes but he wanted to finish in a half hour. I understand that he probably has to often deal with drunk people on the tour (especially since they recommend you show up early and drink before the tour) but that doesn't mean that everybody is and I felt that he treated the group as if we were all drunk or children. However, I did enjoy the tour and would still recommend it to other visitors.The taproom is nice and big since it's essentially just part of a warehouse. There is free popcorn! On one side of the room are all the barrels full of aging beer which is neat to see. The bar itself is huge and can seat many people and the rest of the seating is beer hall style seating. There is also one of the nicest shuffleboard tables that I have ever seen which is great since I enjoy playing. We had great time before and after the tour hanging out with people that we met in the taproom.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 29]}, "11": {"description": "It is ridiculously appropriate that the honor of my 500th review would go to a kick-ass brewery.

The bartenders said that their policy was that every member of our party had to be there to show their ID before they'd give out the tickets. It was kind of annoying, but I get it.

I didn't expect her to make a big deal about it, but it would have been nice for her to maybe smile and offer a \"happy birthday!\" She seemed like she couldn't be less impressed. That attitude continued for the entire tour, unfortunately. From snide comments throughout the tour to eventually telling us we could leave if we didn't want to be there, I felt like she completely missed the memo that there should be an element of hospitality as a tour guide. I will take full responsibility in that we were a little tipsy, but if that is a problem, the brewery should perhaps rethink their policy of needing to be present several hours before a tour to reserve their tickets. Overall, we had a great time and will most likely return for a fun afternoon of hanging out and drinking good beer, but I don't think we'll be doing a tour anytime soon.

The space is the only reason this place gets 1 star. \u00a0Its awesome. \u00a0Large open area in the front with a bar shuffleboard table. \u00a0There are some standing tables as well as some bar stools that make it work for groups, and there are a ton of groups here... \u00a0You can see the oak barrels on display. \u00a0You can also see where the tours go down (more on that later).The beer - the beer is good. Im not the biggest Revolution fan but I can drink it.Price - This is where this place starts to really lose me (and then loses me completely, more on that later). This is a brewery right? I mean, your intention is to get the word out about your beer and get people in here to drink and have a good time right? \u00a0Why in the world are you beers 7 and 8 bucks? I dont get it. Why not knock it down so people will try a couple? \u00a0The only thing I could figure is that you dont want young kids in here getting rowdy? \u00a0Instead the \"older kids\" do?Tour- This is where this place loses me even further. \u00a0I dont understand why you cant sign up for a tour ahead of time so you know you have a spot? \u00a0We arrived on Saturday around 145 and the first tour was full. \u00a0The next tour wasnt until 4pm. \u00a0Again, I love beer and I love hanging out but I kinda just wanted to see the brewery and get the hell on. Its not like this place is anywhere near to anything else. So, once you're there, you're drinking $8 beers and waiting... Staff- are the reason I will not go back nor drink revolution beer anymore. \u00a0Reverting to my beer snob diatribe...why does it appear the entire staff are snobby, annoyed, pissed, surely beer snobs? \u00a0Just doesnt make sense. At all. \u00a0 I understand you must hear some really annoying questions about the beer. \u00a0I can imagine you get a ton of ladies asking for the \"lightest thing you have\". I bet the bros order the \"IPA\". Im sure its annoying. BUT YO!! YOU ARE \u00a0BARTENDER IN A \u00a0BREWERY!! \u00a0You are selling and promoting beer that someone who trusts you to be the representation of their life's work and GET THIS, YOU MAKE MONEY FOR IT. \u00a0Put a smile on. \u00a0Answer questions. \u00a0Be approachable. \u00a0Represent the brand... Otherwise, move to another place where beers snobs hang with beer snobs and make this a better place...

I freakin' love how huge this place is, the giant American flag, the plentiful places to sit/stand/eat your BYOF & drink their delicious beers.5. Music.

They also support causes like the American Cancer Society which they offered shirts that I proudly purchased, so even non tattooed friends can enjoy something.

However, I have seen beautiful portraits he has done and speaking from a person who has over 30 tattoos and has been published in tattoo magazines myself, it's hard to find many local tattoo artists that have talent. There is a hand full of them in Chicago and he is one of them. I also know friends have received piercings from there and the placement is spot on. I have worked in the industry myself for years and people don't appreciate what an art piercing is. It's careful jewelry selection, placement and other factors that base on a successful piercing..I would recommend Italo from there.

Mostly because its walking distance for me. Every time I go I like to try something new, even if its just a small baked good. I'm hoping eventually I'll find something that makes me want to come back more. Its like I'm dating someone that sounds great on paper but the chemistry isn't there. But you keep dating them cause you REALLY want it work out. Its nothing that really puts me off per se. Yes, most people (me included) might feel that they're a bit overpriced but, honestly if you go to Starbucks you're going to be spending the same thing. But I'd rather spend my money on something fresh that, in the long run, would benefit my neighborhood then support a huge corporation. Since I already went there (*whispers* Starbucks) I might as well also note; their coffee menu in no way surpasses Starbucks in variety or quality. I like ordering my drink and knowing that I its made just the way I like it (w/o me having to add anything). That's why I go to places like that, otherwise I could do it at home. When I get a coffee, latte or macchiato, from La Farine, I always have to add sweetener to it. Its just never the same. The sugar doesn't always blend well and I'm left with a gooey lava at the bottom of my cup. And that simple syrup seems too watery. I feel like I have to put in half the bottle to get it sweet enough. Then I feel like I've been standing at the counter so long that the other patrons must be thinking \"Is this her first time having coffee?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But I digress..................Their food menu, however, is a better quality and variety then that of Starbucks. \u00a0Better selection of baked goods and their sandwiches are awesome.

I like that its bright but there's something about the place that isn't quite comfortable. Maybe its the table and chairs. Maybe if they added a couple couches. I'm not sure, since I can't put my finger on it. They have wifi, which is great, but I can't imagine wanting to sit there long enough to do work or surf the net. My last issue with La Farine is that every time I do go (which is maybe 2x/month) there always seems to be a different person manning the register. And when I have a question about a particular baked good (i.e. \"What is that? because they aren't always labeled) or the ingredients of something they usually have to call someone from the back to answer. The last time I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother so I just ordered a coffee and a chocolate chip croissant. But when I opened my bag I received a raisin croissant. The new girl couldn't tell the difference between chocolate chips and raisins?! I went back to switch but was told (by the guy she had to call from the back) that they're out of chocolate chip croissants. Frustrated (and hungry) I walked away with it. To be fair I want to stress that THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME THAT HAS HAPPENED. With all that said, none of these are deal beakers.

Really fun and thoughtful decor with intimate little booths. This venue would be great for private events too.The drinks were big hits. I got the Smoking Rose, which puts mezcal front and center with just enough blackberry to balance the flavor without being too sweet. My partner got the Butcher's Mule, which opts for rye instead of vodka and has a strong minty punch to it. Also delicious.Foodwise, she got the Lamb Merguez meatloaf, which from the bite I had, was delicious and complex. I opted for the Ramen, which seems like a little bit of an oddball on this carnivorous menu, but then again, going for the oddball item is not a bad strategy: if the chef thinks it's worth breaking 'theme' for, it must be good. That rationale paid off, because this bowl of ramen, with a rich, meaty broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and the added goodies of hunk of pork belly and a soft boiled egg, goes toe to toe with any dedicated ramen house in the city. Yeah, I said it.We also got to chat with Dave, the manager, at some length about the Cubs, the neighborhood, and New York (where he grew up and we recently moved back from). Talking to him sealed this place for me. It's not all that hard to get a good meal in Chicago.

Food: \u00a0Complimentary ham with a giardiniera right when we were seated. Very delicious and caused an intense craving to try out their brunch on my next visit. Summer squash to start, the beef tongue gyro, and the lamb shank. The only criticism I would give was the summer squash was a little salty. But we still ate all of it. We planned on sharing the two main dishes. We ate about half of the beef tongue gyro and barely made a dent in lamb shank. All the dishes were incredibly flavorful with unique spins on what you might traditionally expect. Although I insisted my friend take the leftovers home, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I 'forgot' (K - if you stumble across this review it really was an accident) to give them to her and I got to relive this delicious meal the next day.

Disappointment was not an option. We were immediately welcomed by very friendly waitstaff and I instantly fell in love with the decor. Think Restoration Hardware meets Something. Basically, just a cool, open space. As with all dining experiences, libations come first. The wine/cocktail/beer selection was extensive so there are definitely plenty options. Without thought, I gravitated towards the Smokin' Rose: a fruity, blackberry smoky mezcal-y concoction that was pure liquid sunshine. After quite the dilemma as there were so many delicious options, we opted for the hummus. Probably the best I have ever had. It was so fresh that you could taste the cumin and coriander and perhaps a slight hint of orange zest. It was accompanied by warm, perfectly charred pita bread and every bite was delectable. The pickled onions were also a good addition to this dish and it was a beautiful presentation. I wish this moment lasted longer.Now for the meat option. I mean, Son of a Butcher has pretty high standards to live up to with a name like that. But no problem. They did it. Get the Lamb Merguez hot dog. It comes with grilled apples, sage and a spicy mustard. Amazing flavors and ingredients that married each other and I was there to witness it. After each bite, something was happening to my heart. It was becoming full, right with my tummy. That is always a good sign. Finally, the chef Frank, is amazing. He introduced himself to us and personally made it his mission to ensure that we were having a great experience. A modest man with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

I had simpler tastes and my idea of a nice dinner was going to Baker's Square. So brunch was one of those terms like aioli or molecular gastronomy that didn't really resonate with me at all. After Son of a Butcher's Cochon Brunch, I'm kinda glad I'm in the know. Sam and I decided to come in on a Saturday morning around noon. It was raining a bit outside so the outdoor seating along Richmond St. were empty. I can imagine it would be a pretty sweet spot to grab some food on a warm night though. On the inside the decor kinda reminded me of steampunk a little bit. I could be way off here but there were a lot of brass and wood finishings. Plus there were these chairs that almost looked like they had gears on the legs. You could tell some thought went into the style of this place. Plus, the murals they have going on outside are pretty neat too. I figure this shot has been taken a hundred times before but this greets you as you walk up. Being the cochon (pig) brunch, I kinda had to go with the Piggie by the pound. Sam went with the Beef Navel Eggs Benedict, classic brunch food. Sam said that her eggs Benedict were good, I tried a bit and the yolks and hollandaise running into the muffin made it a really rich bite. The star though was the Piggie by the pound. You get a serious pile of pulled pork with some corn tortillas and I decided to add-on some almond chimichurri for good measure. The pork was super tender but there was still some pieces with a bit of a crunch to them and then there were some fatty bits mixed in too. Wow is pretty much all I have to say. If you come here for brunch and you don't try this, you're doing it wrong. I will say that it can probably feed 2 people and it was only $11 when I went. That's an awesome deal. Since I was eating at a tavern I also snagged a Goose Island Green Line. There were just a few nits to pick though. Sam came in wanting to try the biscuits and gravy and the spuddies on the side but they weren't ready yet. That was kind of unfortunate since it was already an hour after they opened. Aside from that, I'd say Son of a Butcher was a solid 3.5 out of 5 for me. With Fat Rice across the street and Longman & Eagle a few blocks away, Son of a Butcher has some high profile neighbors, but I think it holds it's own.

I have to say I think this was an EXCELLENT idea to get the residents of Avondale & Logan Square involved and excited about the opening of their restaurant. Really smart marketing on their part, so kudos! Plus the whole event went very smooth and was seamless from what I could see as a customer.I made a reservation through OpenTable and it appears they will continue taking reservations. They have a limited amount of tables so if you plan on going to eat, I would highly recommend making a reservation. Other than the few booths (which are super chic & comfy), it's standing room only at the bar. Interesting approach to not have stools or seating at the bar. Overall though, I loved the decor and atmosphere of SOB (is this okay to write in a review!? I feel dirty!!!)Service was excellent throughout our stay with multiple people checking in on us and making sure our glasses were filled and our bellies were full. I was quite happy with their draft list. Though not huge they had nearly 100% local breweries on tap - Solemn Oath, Off Color, Lagunitas, 5 Rabbit, Half Acre, Revolution, Pipeworks and Marz. I highly appreciate supporting our local breweries and loved that that's the approach they are taking. Not only that, but they don't have the standards from these breweries on tap. Sure we all know Anti Hero, 5 Lizard and Scurry are great...but awesome to be able to try some NEW brews. Beer prices aren't atrocious either ranging from $5-7 for the tap beers. On top of the draught beers, they have bottles of some of the standards plus some unique things like sours! You're after my heart, SOB. And don't worry hipsters, they have PBR, Old Style and Old Milwaukee. Short version of my beer gushing, I'm down with their liqs selection.Hey Sarah! That's all fine and good about drinks...but this place is called Son of a BUTCHER!!! What about the food?!?! Yea, yea, over eager beavers...I'm getting there! The bites I was able to preview last night:Coriander Crusted Goat Cheese Fritter, Apple Compote $8 - These little guys pack a punch and I don't recommend eating them on their own, the goat cheese will overwhelm you. Doused in the apple compote though, it makes for a fun and tasty bite.Rice Cracklings, Salsa Verde, Pickled Vegetables $6 - Not an overly exciting dish but if you need something clean and non-threatening to munch on while sipping suds, this starter may be calling your name. My friend loved all the pickled veggies that came with the dish.Lamb Merguez Hot Dog, Grilled Apples, Sage, Spicy Mustard $13 - Loved the lamb sausage! The chunk of apple was huge so they may need to cut them up a bit more in the future but the flavors went together very well in this dish and I could see myself ordering this on the regular.Chistorra and Fried Oyster Po'boy, Cucumber, Yuzu $13 - I had never had chistorra before and love trying new food items. That little sausage was probably my favorite meat of the entire evening! Hog Wellington, Oyster Mushroom Duxelle, Smoked Lemon Hollandaise $18 - I can see the potential in this and I definitely want to give this another try in the full dish form. The meat in this wellington seemed a bit dried out but I'd like to attribute that to the tiny portion.One thing I really am enjoying about the Son of a Butcher menu is the great balance of flavors. They use strong ingredients but offset them with something more calming paired in the dish. I also was seeing some flavor combinations I haven't before.Official opening is June 18th! Their Cochon brunch menu looks awesome & will be served Saturdays & Sundays from 11am-3pm. I can't wait to try the brunch and some other menu items.

I had simpler tastes and my idea of a nice dinner was going to Baker's Square. So brunch was one of those terms like aioli or molecular gastronomy that didn't really resonate with me at all. After Son of a Butcher's Cochon Brunch, I'm kinda glad I'm in the know. Sam and I decided to come in on a Saturday morning around noon. It was raining a bit outside so the outdoor seating along Richmond St. were empty. I can imagine it would be a pretty sweet spot to grab some food on a warm night though. On the inside the decor kinda reminded me of steampunk a little bit. I could be way off here but there were a lot of brass and wood finishings. Plus there were these chairs that almost looked like they had gears on the legs. You could tell some thought went into the style of this place. Plus, the murals they have going on outside are pretty neat too. I figure this shot has been taken a hundred times before but this greets you as you walk up. Being the cochon (pig) brunch, I kinda had to go with the Piggie by the pound. Sam went with the Beef Navel Eggs Benedict, classic brunch food. Sam said that her eggs Benedict were good, I tried a bit and the yolks and hollandaise running into the muffin made it a really rich bite. The star though was the Piggie by the pound. You get a serious pile of pulled pork with some corn tortillas and I decided to add-on some almond chimichurri for good measure. The pork was super tender but there was still some pieces with a bit of a crunch to them and then there were some fatty bits mixed in too. Wow is pretty much all I have to say. If you come here for brunch and you don't try this, you're doing it wrong. I will say that it can probably feed 2 people and it was only $11 when I went. That's an awesome deal. Since I was eating at a tavern I also snagged a Goose Island Green Line. There were just a few nits to pick though. Sam came in wanting to try the biscuits and gravy and the spuddies on the side but they weren't ready yet. That was kind of unfortunate since it was already an hour after they opened. Aside from that, I'd say Son of a Butcher was a solid 3.5 out of 5 for me.

Basically, just a cool, open space. As with all dining experiences, libations come first. The wine/cocktail/beer selection was extensive so there are definitely plenty options. Without thought, I gravitated towards the Smokin' Rose: a fruity, blackberry smoky mezcal-y concoction that was pure liquid sunshine. After quite the dilemma as there were so many delicious options, we opted for the hummus. Probably the best I have ever had. It was so fresh that you could taste the cumin and coriander and perhaps a slight hint of orange zest. It was accompanied by warm, perfectly charred pita bread and every bite was delectable. The pickled onions were also a good addition to this dish and it was a beautiful presentation. I wish this moment lasted longer.Now for the meat option. I mean, Son of a Butcher has pretty high standards to live up to with a name like that. But no problem. They did it. Get the Lamb Merguez hot dog. It comes with grilled apples, sage and a spicy mustard. Amazing flavors and ingredients that married each other and I was there to witness it. After each bite, something was happening to my heart. It was becoming full, right with my tummy. That is always a good sign. Finally, the chef Frank, is amazing.

I was a little nervous about the menu using 'the odds and ends' of cuts and that the proteins would taste gamey. I was totally wrong. All the food was really good and looked and smelled really appetizing. I also appreciated that the chef and front of the house manager (I think it was FOH or it was just the restaurant manager) came by our table and chatted with us. They were very friendly and welcoming. The food itself was 5 stars but I took off 2 stars for terrible service. I understand that with a new restaurant, the servers are still learning the menu and getting oriented with restaurant/pace of kitchen and tables but this was hands down, one of the most memorable experiences of bad service that I've had.The server got the order of one of my friends wrong. When the runners came by and gave us the food, we noticed that she had gotten the Beef Neck bowl instead of the Beef Tongue sandwich. This happens sometimes and it's ok. It's the follow-up that makes or breaks the experience. Our server never seemed to stop by our table on his accord. We continuously tried to flag him down but he literary never looked in our direction. He did look confused sometimes and was rushing from one room to the other but always looked past our table. We finally flagged him down and told him that the dish was wrong. He looked confused and I got this feeling that he might not know the menu very well. He apologized and said he would get the right dish over. The FOH manager had also stopped to check with us and we said everything was ok (because we didn't realize how bad it was going to get). We didn't eat our meals until our friend received hers and it was about 20 minutes later before it arrived. I thought this was kinda a long time to wait for a dish that was for a mistaken order. I would think that this would be bumped to the first order to be worked on and come out 10-15 minutes. Throughout the rest of the meal, we sat with empty water glasses for half the meal because our server never came by. He also kept forgetting our drink orders. We had to continuously flag him down for water and to remind him if our drinks were still coming (1 diet coke and 4 beers throughout the meal). And to top it off, we kept waiting for the check after all our dishes were cleared and drinks were done. We finally got it after flagging him down and of course, waited a long time again to get the card picked up and processed. I noticed that I was charged for my refill of diet coke which is hilarious because it was like pulling teeth to get that refill. What a bitter experience regarding service.

They bring out a small plate of sliced meat as you sit down, which is a very nice touch. The food was good here. I'm interested to see how the menu evolves over time. I sampled the lamb tartare, which was different than I expected with a nice curry flavor and creamy texture. The bone marrow was good, as you would expect, but nothing unique. I wasn't a huge fan of the goat cheese fritters, not that they were bad but just not notable enough for me to order them again. The Hog Wellington was delicious, but it was served on a tiny plate which was very strange. I had a bite of the \"no beef\" mushroom Italian beef knock-off and thought that was really good, but I'm not a huge fan of the thin fried potatoes. I could see the sandwich menu being a go-to for me here.

I got the Smoking Rose, which puts mezcal front and center with just enough blackberry to balance the flavor without being too sweet. My partner got the Butcher's Mule, which opts for rye instead of vodka and has a strong minty punch to it. Also delicious.Foodwise, she got the Lamb Merguez meatloaf, which from the bite I had, was delicious and complex. I opted for the Ramen, which seems like a little bit of an oddball on this carnivorous menu, but then again, going for the oddball item is not a bad strategy: if the chef thinks it's worth breaking 'theme' for, it must be good. That rationale paid off, because this bowl of ramen, with a rich, meaty broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and the added goodies of hunk of pork belly and a soft boiled egg, goes toe to toe with any dedicated ramen house in the city. Yeah, I said it.We also got to chat with Dave, the manager, at some length about the Cubs, the neighborhood, and New York (where he grew up and we recently moved back from).

The menu is rather small. It would be cute and charming, if the food were good. The bread is awesome. But what's up with the sour cream that comes with it? I love sour cream, but on bread??? Must be a Romanian thing. Greek salad was ok. Generous, actually. Enough for 4 people I'm guessing. For an entree I went with the pork schnitzel. They also have a chicken version. If seated near the kitchen, you can hear the cook pounding the schnitzel which is kind of cool. It was ok. The breading was good. Tasted like Mom would make. The mashed potatoes were awful. I'm fairly certain they were instant potatoes. If not, they were an excellent impostor. This dish was served with no sauce or gravy, so it was unpleasantly dry. I tasted the sausage dish. It was ok, although the sausage was a little rubbery. Their homemade fries are actually good, even when undercooked as they were. Another pisser is the lack of choice in alcoholic beverages, unless our server didn't tell us about everything. She rattled off a few bottled beers, Romanian wine, and half a dozen or so liquors.

It's this amazing sour soup with sausage and egg. It's definitely unique and worth a try. If you like potato pancakes you're in luck, I really love the Hungarian pancakes here. They're just like regular potato pancakes except covered in this meaty stew with peppers and onions. My wife goes with a classic pork cutlet or a breaded tenderloin basically. Covered with a mushroom sauce you can't go wrong. Also notable here are the Pierogi of course. I get the ruskie with potato and cheese while my wife likes the strawberry the best.

Tis our family's belated mother's day celebration and we pinpointed this sweet Polish location. For such inexpensive prices, portions were insanely generous. Our party of us went all out with appetizers, entrees, and dessert! For the hot appetizers, we had the breaded camembert cheese with pineapple and cranberry sauce and the stuffed mushrooms with prosciutto. The cheese was melted and very soft, but it had an odd aroma to it. The stuffed mushrooms were pleasant but I wouldn't know there's prosciutto in them if they weren't stated on the menu.As for entrees, we tried a wide variety: vegetarian platter, beef stragonoff, veal cutlet, white fish, Vienna cutlet, and Swiss cutlet. It was a lot of meat and carbs. I had the Swiss cutlet with a side of potato dumplings. The cutlet was well fried but not as crisp as I would have liked it. The potato dumplings were quite new to me. It came in little white balls and the texture was very sticky on the outside. The inside was very compressed mashed potato. A few of these and you would be too stuffed to proceed with the meal. I gave the veal cutlet a try as well and I would probably order that on my second visit. It isn't as heavy as the cutlet and I liked the mushrooms they served with the entree. In hindsight, I realized I should have taken dessert elsewhere. We tried the cheesecake and blintzes with cheese. We're obviously dairy fans and lactose-tolerant. The cheesecake was very crumbly and each fork would send chunks tumbling onto the plate. It came with a slice of pineapple and I thought the flavors were misfitting. The blintzes were served warm but it was heavily filled with cold cheese. I'm not certain if that's how it is supposed to be served.

The liver was covered in crisp, greasy onion strands and accompanied by buttery, garlic mashed potatoes.

It's usually never that crowded inside but lately I feel like the secret is out. It's definitely worth a visit.  Now if you've never had Polish food before let me tell you what my wife and I tend to get whenever we go. Start with a beer. Zywiec or Tyskie preferably. Start with a bowl of Zurek soup. It's this amazing sour soup with sausage and egg. It's definitely unique and worth a try. If you like potato pancakes you're in luck, I really love the Hungarian pancakes here. They're just like regular potato pancakes except covered in this meaty stew with peppers and onions. My wife goes with a classic pork cutlet or a breaded tenderloin basically. Covered with a mushroom sauce you can't go wrong. Also notable here are the Pierogi of course. I get the ruskie with potato and cheese while my wife likes the strawberry the best. No matter what way you go you'll be happy and full though. A great way to sample is the special for 2. You get to try a polish feast and I bet you'll still be taking food home. Staropolska is a great way to try a cuisine many people might not be familiar with. I didn't even mention that the decor is kinda neat as everything as a nice rustic look to it.

It has an Old World feel. Lots of brick and wooden accents with large, dark wooden tables and chairs. They also have an additional fancy banquet area, but we didn't eat in that part, and I'm glad we didn't. You can find that anywhere.What you can't find everywhere is perfect pierogi. They have it. At least the meat ones were done just right in my eyes. I was particularly fond of the added bacon bits and side of sour cream.Service was great.

Unfortunately, some of the stuff was well-cooked but bland. Mushroom Soup: 4.5/5 -- This might have been the highlight of my night. The soup was very, very good. Filled with flavor. Our Special for Two People: 3.5/5 -- Great choice for non-vegetarians. Well-cooked beef and chicken along with pieroges and pancakes. Vegetarian Plate: 3.5/5 -- This came with spinach and cheese pieroges -- both of which were well-made. Like most of the dishes, I really, really wanted more flavor. Add some spices, some garlic, something! Devolay: 3/5 -- Pretty good fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Nothing spectacular but overall pretty solid. Apple Pie: 2/5 -- I guess Polish apple pies are just not my thing.

I was deprived of this particular entertainment at Staropolska Restaurant because our server was a young Polish woman who brought us the food we ordered and was nice about it to boot! She even affirmed my (Polish) friend's decision to sprinkle sugar on her potato pancake dressed with sour cream and apple sauce. The food was good at Staropolska - the potato pancakes tasted as though they had been made with secret meat (I cannot confirm nor deny the addition of meat), and the veal liver had a nice sear on it. The liver was covered in crisp, greasy onion strands and accompanied by buttery, garlic mashed potatoes. I do have to say the pierogi was disappointing - the skins were somewhat uneven, the sweet cheese filling was grainy, and the fruit filling insufficient.

So much fun.On weekdays, I think you might want to check the calendar (available on their website) because I've been there on rockabilly nights. And it would be kind of weird if you were aching to dance to new wave and you showed up to pompadours and Chuck Berry, right?

I'm usually doing whiskey and beer by the time I get here. They do have some interesting beers available. And the bartenders and door people always seem cool.

We had some friends in town this weekend and I didn't know where to take them post-obligatory-Kuma's-dinner. I was too tired for Wicker Park, too full to sit at a place that also served food, and too easily annoyed for any downtown bars. We decided to go out on a limb and rock out to some new wave tunes in a bar where you can also actually converse without screaming. I usually refuse to pay cover at a bar out of principle, but it was only $5 so I survived. But still. Cover. Ugh.The place is pretty small but has a lovely, dark, dreamy vibe with large white paper spheres dabbling the ceiling, a glowing backlit bar and baroque edged frames adorning the walls. The bar is cash only (woh wohhhh) but we all survived (and didn't spend a TON of money as a result). I was only going to have one cocktail, so I made it a fancy one - the Soda Jerk ($10) which is a shot of delicious coconut (you can choose other flavors too!) liquor poured into a glass of sweet, decadent craft cream soda. It was so rich and delicious tasting that I was able to sip just that one drink during our time here. There are some people dancing, but I admittedly have no idea how to dance to new wave tunes and elected instead to sit at the bar and gaze at my much drinker crew from afar.

She exceeded our expectations and delivered flowers that brought to life the vision I had in mind. The entire process - from initial consultation to final consultation to delivery of personal flowers and set-up/wind-down of the reception flowers was seamless. I took it to be a good sign when I met Lynn that one of the photos I pinned on my Pinterest board was a bouquet that Lynn had done. Anyway, at the initial consultation, we discussed the vision I had in mind, reviewed her past work to clarify the intended style and tone of the arrangements and also considered the potential floral needs for the wedding. One thing that surprised me was all the opportunities to add a floral touch to the event - and how much can change from the initial consultation to the final consultation in terms of floral needs (we ended up adding more flowers to the mix and I flirted with the idea of a floral wreath). After the initial consultation, I was impressed to receive a set of guidelines and anticipated timeframe with expected events/meetings to occur before the wedding. She offered a floral proposal that was spot on but was also willing to consider other flowers and options when I was unsure of a particular bloom. Lynn expertly offered suggestions and adjustments to make sure our vision came alive. To sum it up, my vision was essentially, a bridal bouquet with white flowers and lots of greenery, with the lady slipper orchid as a feature, and all other flowers to be a \"mix and blend of pink and red flowers with lots of greenery and touches of gold, but not anything that looks holiday - oh, and gardeny and organic looking too, but with architectural details and different textures and tones.\" Somehow, some way, she got it completely right, even with that description.

My favorite things about her were that she seemed so excited to work with me to create a palette that would work and she was so into the idea of using some \"non traditional\" flowers and elements to incorporate the autumnal theme I was working on (at least I had that, LOL). We probably met for like 2 hours and she was so patient with me and my utter lack of floral knowledge. I really felt like we were a team trying to figure out the best ideas and it was fun and put me at ease right away. Also, similarly to other brides on Yelp, we did not have a huge budget and Lynn instantly came up with ideas that fit my budget and didn't push it. Love it!The bouquets, boutonierres, and centerpieces at my wedding all were amazing!! She even used Granny Smith apples in the centerpieces which looked great and was so inventive.

Or as my sister said after her wedding \"Lynn for the win!\" If I could turn back time, I would have loved to have worked with Lynn for my wedding. I found that my satisfaction with wedding vendors came down to two elements: 1) experience and 2) results. Lynn has both nailed. As for experience: she is cheerful, organized, resourceful, conscientious, a good listener and communicator, flexible, precise... I could go on and on. She understands that she is an artist, yes, but she really gets that she is a service provider first. As you may have found, this can be a real challenge when hiring creatives. Lynn is a miraculous blend of the best of 'Type A business person' with the best of 'Type B creative.' Plus if you are into being conscientious about the environment, she has that expertise. As for the results? They were perfect. Just perfect. Stunning, a reflection of the brides' wishes, yet somehow even better. She truly exceeded expectations! And I probably don't have to remind you that wedding expectations are HIGH. This was all after the always inevitable conceptual changes, plus budget cuts etc. The flowers were just gorgeous. I should probably note at this time that I am in the design industry and thus a snooty and particular person, so this is a big deal for me to be this impressed and excited. I'll encourage my sister to write a review and share her photos so you can see for yourself. : )To conclude, I should mention how I found Lynn. In an effort to help my sister with planning I reached out to a number of top-rated florists who also had great photos. Of them all, Lynn was one of TWO who were organized enough to get back to me in a timely manner. Yes, you read that right, two. (In case you were wondering, the other florist didn't have much inventory of decor and didn't have nearly as much experience.) You do have to hand it to anyone who runs their own business, it is tough, perhaps sometimes especially so if you have a creative personality. That being said, as a bride or other event organizer, you pay someone to make things easier for you, and to produce something awesome in the end, right? It's just that simple.To find someone who provides both a stellar experience and stunning results and all at a reasonable price?! It is like finding a unicorn.

She didn't harass us to no end, although some people may like being followed around a store...I don't. I think it's annoying and a horrible way to go about trying to sell something. She didn't try to only show us the expensive mattresses she just told us to try what we liked and we'd take it from there. She wasn't overly aware of what the Groupon covered (since we went the morning the Groupon was released and they had been open for maybe 25 minutes) but she said it only covered sets, which we read online wasn't the case. We showed her the app and she read the fine print herself and saw that the manager had been telling me mattresses and sets she apologized and said in the email they were told sets, but she's glad she knows if anyone else comes in so I thought that was really nice. We fell in love with a bed that was $599 and she encouraged us to just lay in the bed and think about the decision instead of trying to rush us into payment. She told us a lot of people find a bed they like and they buy it instantly and end up returning it so she wanted us to avoid that hassle and be sure. She actually encouraged us to lay there for a while and we were talking about how much we all love Groupon. I thought she was really pleasant and offered great service. She covered all the corners and explained in great detail the differences between this and that, fees, etc. We got the bed, it was delivered to us the next day for $79 so all in all with tax I think we still ended up paying $400ish, BUT we've had it for a week and I think it was a great purchase. Normally I regret costly expenses, but I'm glad we jumped in and got it and it was great to get $150 off. Without it we probably would have either never gotten a bed or we would have gotten something cheap. So, if you want a new bed with or without the Groupon I recommend coming here.

I went to look for a queen mattress on Black Friday at this location. Before, i checked their website to see the deals they have. I was looking at Simmons brand Beautyrest.They had a deal queen set for $199 ,king set for $299 and then the Beautyrest Black series which according to the add was \"Save 50% + Save an Extra 20% on our entire collection of Beautyrest Black mattress sets\". LIEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS.FALSE ADVERTISING. First of all in the store no adds, nothing about the sale, nowhere advertised. The queen and king sets that were supposedly 199 and 299 were advertised at 799 and up(guess if you were not checking the website before going in the store how much would they have charged you?). Store manager(Cindy) did not mention anything to me about it until i asked about the sale and then she tried to tell me that those are only for black friday and they don't even carry those in the store everyday(right that's why the price was 799) bulls**t. I was not looking to buy those anyway you can probably find them anytime anywhere at that price, lowest quality in the store. The one i have for 10 years is probably better.I was checking the Beautyrest Black which did not have the prices advertised(they were covered). She showed us the pricing after we asked how come we don't see it advertised like the others. Me and my girlfriend check them out, they were 3 sets ranging from 2199 to 2699.(queen) \u00a0So i mention that i saw on their website 50% +20% off on these. She did not really know what to say so she pulled another price about $8000 saying that maybe it was off from the manufacturer price. If that was true (which is not i checked online and other stores everybody had them in the 2000 price range, went to Macys later that day) then how come they did not advertised the big price crossed out with the 50%+20% off price next to it, i mean that's how you advertise a sale if you really have one. You don't play it by ear hopping you find the idiots you can scam.I went home, printed the add and off to the store on Clybourn to see what do they have. Same thing nothing advertised but this time i knew were to look for the pricing so i showed the guy the add sale from their website puled out the mattress price same as the other store $2199 and ask him for 50+20% off and the guy says:\"Well sir this price is already 50% reduced\" I started laughing and i asked him to show me where does it say that; you are showing one price nothing next to it that says 50% reduced or anywhere in the store, how do i know it's reduced you can say about any price that it's reduced 80% then, you can say anything at this point and he said he's sorry but that's already reduced and that's how they show it. So i \u00a0said thank you and walked away and he was confused why am i leaving the store saying that he has other mattress.Later on i went to Macy's cause they are carrying this brand and i saw the same mattress at same price range; explicit price and then take 10% off of the price.That's how you advertise the sale.So to sum up, some advice:Mattress sale one of the biggest scams.Do your homework before going into a store specially BACK TO BED.Never tell them how much you want to spend they will try to sell you low quality for that price.If you go in to the store today they have the same prices.I am going to write this review on every website where they have reviews and write a letter to BBB and FTC Bureau of consumer protectionI posted a photo of the web add.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 11, 30]}, "4": {"description": "Nick was incredible!
