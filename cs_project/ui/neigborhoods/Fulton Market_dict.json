Liked the \u00a010 choices for cemitas - there is bound to be a meat on the list you are having a craving for (less the veggie and cow foot ones; unless that's your thing). 3 homemade salsas on each table in squeeze bottles; good favors that complemented the food. Overall impressions - good Mexican food (can't comment on the authenticity related to the Puebla region because I have not been to that part of Mexico), really good for lunch, liked the feel of the place, tables were being bussed very attentively, don't care much for the neighborhood (parking is a bitch). \u00a0I'd definitely go back.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 2]}, "56": {"description": "Tried the Cemitas Atomica.

One good thing though was they exchanged something we didnt like for something else with no additional charge which is good because some places dont care.

They put so much cheese on here like if u try to squish the sandwhich all the cheese would be acting like a spring which will make u not be able to squish it.

Go for their namesake, and get Cemitas here. Specifically the Cemita Atomica. That sandwich alone is enough to warrant the 5 stars. So how do they make their sandwiches here? First, start with a sesame bun which is large enough to hold all the meat, while still being soft and flavorful. Next, a layer of fresh avocado, which brightens the sandwich and adds a healthy dose of fat and creaminess. Then your meat. Of course, at this point you've already decided to order the Atomica, which has 3 meats(ham, breaded pork loin, and grilled pork loin). And then top with Oaxaca cheese, the perfect texture between melted and stringy, and another bun.You order at the counter, and then they bring the food out to you and clean up after you as well. They also provide you with 3 house hot sauces, which are all delicious. I like to mix the orange and red one, and spread it generously on my cemita as I scarf it down. The portion is also quite sizeable; you will not be hungry after one of these sandwiches. Next time I come by, I think I'll give the Carne Asada Cemita a try.

Also, the dark red salsa was pretty if you want a smokey and hotter salsa--perhaps guajillo-pepper based. Anyhow, from there the food honestly got bland (2/5).

Sad to say, I will never return again. \u00a0I will still keep the good memory I had about the original location in a safe place in my brain so I can maybe tell my kids about it one day...

First, start with a sesame bun which is large enough to hold all the meat, while still being soft and flavorful. Next, a layer of fresh avocado, which brightens the sandwich and adds a healthy dose of fat and creaminess. Then your meat. Of course, at this point you've already decided to order the Atomica, which has 3 meats(ham, breaded pork loin, and grilled pork loin). And then top with Oaxaca cheese, the perfect texture between melted and stringy, and another bun.You order at the counter, and then they bring the food out to you and clean up after you as well. They also provide you with 3 house hot sauces, which are all delicious. I like to mix the orange and red one, and spread it generously on my cemita as I scarf it down. The portion is also quite sizeable; you will not be hungry after one of these sandwiches. Next time I come by, I think I'll give the Carne Asada Cemita a try.

Well its 11:15 and only 12 of us got in for free while 7 had to pay $10 bucks? What i didnt understand is why anyone had to pay when the website and txt said FREE COVER TIL MIDNIGHT. They couldve said something to me before we got outta the bus :/ & its not like the club was packed cuz it wasnt! It was pretty dead & when i went downstairs to talk to them why 7 of my guest has to pay the bouncers where rude and just pointed me to \"the manager\" & all he had to say was since im doing bottle service and only buying 2 bottles only 12 of could get in because we were a LARGE party and he hoped i have a good time? Really thats not even answering my question but w.e. i went back upstairs to just get even more annoyed to find out that they werent gonna let us go outside to smoke!?! Wtf!

My sister decided to have her birthday celebrations here over the Halloween weekend. She booked a table a few weeks in advanced with the manager Gabriel. Everything was set, she got an email the day of to confirm the table and it looked like everything was good to go. They advised us to get there from 9-11 for a free entry. We got there around 9:30ish and we got in with no problem. We let them know we had reserved a table only to tell us that we had to wait till 11 pm because our table was downstairs and they don't open that section till that time. Okay no biggie, we'll wait till then. So we all pretty much just huddled around the bar area, grabbed some drinks and waited. Here comes 11 and we advise them again that we had reserved a table. So they bring us downstairs and they lead us to the VIP tables only to sit us at the very end corner of the table. We had a group of 9, how were 9 people supposed to sit in a very small corner table? We literally were taking over the empty table next to us. So here comes this guy with a clipboard and a headpiece telling us that we all had to move because there was going to be another party next to us. I advised him we booked a table for 9 how are we all going to be huddled in one corner. He advised me they only ask us how many people per table because that's how many they are going to let in for free but none of there tables fit 9 people. Okay so if that wasn't enough they then told us that they would eventually have to move us from the table they originally gave us because the party next to them would have more people expected. Okay by that time I'm pretty pissed. They had us move to another table right across the room ONLY to tell us that AGAIN. We would have to be moved eventually. My sister was asking them why would you move us around if we paid for a table just like everyone else? Why do we have to sit at the table for only a limited amount of time. After they finally got themselves organized we got moved to ANOTHER table, one that we wouldn't have to be moved from for the rest of night. All the while, the server for the night was explaining to us that the manager ALWAYS books reservations for big parties when they don't even have tables for that size and it makes they're jobs harder. She advised us that he would be showing up later on and that she would tell him to come talk to us. So when we finally settled in, we got our bottles and TRIED to enjoy the rest of the night. Mind you, some of our party still had to stand around the table since our spot was still very small. The only good thing about this club was the music. They had a good variety of music on all the floors. This was our first time going there and it just so happened to be on Halloween day so yes it was pretty packed. I'm not sure how it gets on any other days. So the night was coming to an end, my sister asked our server if the manager ever got there and she told us that he never showed up. Very professional. So all in all, come here to dance and for the music but I don't advise you to book a table for them because they are very disorganized especially for big parties.

I called a week later and asked if my MacBook was ready, the way the person spoke on the phone it was like they were clueless of MacBook even being there. They put me on hold and 5 mins later they find the MacBook and said they haven't had a chance to look at it yet and proceeds to ask me what is wrong with it . I remained calm and explained the issue they said ok we will take a look at it and we'll give you a call in a couple days, I never received a call. I called a week later again and asked about the MacBook, again they told me they had techs look over it, and they didn't see the issue I explained they said the hard drive just needed to be replaced. They told me the amount of the services and when the parts would be in to get my MacBook up and running, again I was told I was going to get a call back, never received that call. So 2 weeks later I call back and asked about the status of my MacBook and they say the part still hasn't come in... A month later I call again and ask the status of my MacBook, they tell me they put the hard drive in and it didn't work still.

So, semi long story- I shattered my iPhone screen (for the second time- I'm a klutz) and took it to uBreakiFix for same day replacement at a lower price than Apple. It was ready promptly in less than an hour and looked great! However, problems arose when I took it home and the screen was occasionally a little \"glitchy\" in a way it hadn't been before (a Google search tells me that this can be known to happen when replacing the iPhone screen). I called uBreakiFix and they were totally nice about me bringing it back in for them to look at it. After some time waiting for it to get glitchy again so they could see what was going on, they agreed to replace the screen. This is where things went downhill for my phone. Apparently, when they tried to swap out screens, my phone flat out refused to work! Ahh! To make matters worse, I was leaving in less than 48 hours for a 5 week trip and desperately needed a working phone. My tight timeline meant that they didn't have enough time to run diagnostics on it and figure out what was going on. So, because they're the best and they stand by their work, they decided to just replace my phone with a brand new one- at no cost to me. AND, because they could only get an appointment at the Apple store after they closed, the manager Eddy stayed late and drove it to me. \u00a0I repeat- HE DROVE THE PHONE TO ME so I wouldn't have to go out of my way. Unbelievable. I honestly have never had better customer service. They took a stressful, potentially disastrous situation and turned it into one that I am constantly raving about to my friends.

The girl that I was working with at this florist in Oak Park told me because I was having an evening wedding church started at (6:30pm) she would have to set up that Friday night before the wedding. My first instinct was that it was okay...... but then after thinking about the whole picture, for my reception I did three cylinder centerpieces that were submerged in water! The flowers would look horrible if I walked in on Saturday evening to see them all ruined.SO I started to freak out. What was were my wedding flowers going to look like with this horrible florist?!? Who was I going to find three weeks prior to my wedding?I couldn't get my deposit back so I ended up just using them for my rehearsal dinner, glad I did only that! The flowers were a joke!LOW AND BEHOLD I was told by a friend of mine that she was using NATURAL BEAUTIES FOR HER UPCOMING WEDDING IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR.She told me she had great things to say about them so far and they had great reviews. So of course I called. Jan called me back right away! I told her my situation and she was very professional about the whole thing. At first she didn't want to step on any ones toes as I'm in sales and I appreciate that. She even guided me on the process of what to do with the other florist.Luckily they were able to do the flowers for my wedding! She was very detailed. We exchanged emails back and forth.

I thought they were going to put a few to make it look really pretty. I will tell you they weren't shy! They made it look AMAZING! They had enough to cover the whole ledge all the way around the entire room. It looked so pretty!I had the three cylinder vases on each table submerged in water with a floating candle on top. The quality of the flowers SHOCKED me! They looked almost fake because they were all so PERFECT! They used such great flowers. They were everything I was hoping for and more!I also had them do two larger arrangements and everyone was STUNNED! They were so pretty!

We have a large family, and were looking for 15 formal pieces, as well as flowers for the tables and altar. We found the people at Natural Beauties were extremely helpful. They worked with the vision my wife had and put together a proposal that was practical and more realistic (they could have sold us hydrangea or something, for example, but suggested a heartier and cheaper alternative which worked wonderfully). We found all of the options available to us to be a bit overwhelming, and the staff made firm but extremely helpful recommendations (otherwise it would have taken us 3 hours for the meeting!). In the end, the quote came back higher than what we wanted to spend. Natural Beauties worked with us to scale back the proposal, and seemed willing and happy to do so. At no point in scaling things back did they make us feel at all uncomfortable; they handled things extremely graciously and professionally. The flowers themselves, were great. I can't really speak intelligently about them (again, I know nothing about flowers). However, my wife and everyone who knows about these sorts of things loved them, and they look great to me.

I liked their products and was happy with the service.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The last 3 times I have stepped in (over the past 5 months) I have been met with staff who were extremely inexperienced and undertrained, or who maybe just don't seem to care.  \u00a0 \u00a0 In February the guy working the counter misheard me and rang me up for an extra donut, and since I had already given him my credit card, didn't realize the over charge until he gave me my receipt. No prob. Except he had no idea how the store's POS worked, there was a line out the door and no manager on site. After trying to figure out what to do and telling me directly that he wasn't really trained, he apologized profusely and then took a piece of receipt paper and wrote \"good for one donut\" on it. This actually happened.  \u00a0 \u00a0The next time I came in, there was a film crew who weren't filming but clearly took prescient over the guy who just wants a coffee and donut. When I was finally waited on, the barista kept asking me repeatedly what kind of milk I wanted in my Americano, until I told him to just put some espresso in some hot water. Then the phone rang and he left my shots just sitting there while he took the call, despite there being two other employees behind the counter who didn't seem to really be doing anything.  \u00a0 \u00a0Today I walked in at 10:30am and there were no donuts. It wasn't even like they had just sold the last donut, there were no signs, no trays, nothing. Just a clean, empty display case. It's like there never were any donuts. Since 3 other people were in line in front of me, I figured there must be more donuts coming. Maybe. I'd have to wait and see since behind the counter were two employees each on separate phone calls and a third making coffee. Another patron came in behind me and asked where all the donuts were, and the woman at the front explained to the group that they were all sold out and she was just waiting for coffee. Then the store cleared out.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I'm not faulting the business for not being able to keep up with the demand of one day or providing a popular product. My bottom line is that their in house staff just doesn't seem to get it. Why are you open when you don't have anything to sell? Why are you allowing customers to come in and line up for nothing? At least you can make a sign saying you're out of donuts, or delegate maybe one employee to deal with disappointed customers.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Their donuts aren't worth $4. Just go to Mariano's.

I was a bit upset about that especially when I'm about to give them my business, but oh well. This won't be a spot I would stop by again. It's kinda of like been there, done that! Although, the neighborhood is pretty industrial and has wanderers so I can understand how they don't allow public bathrooms, but if your're a paying customer, I don't understand why not. Anyways, I got the Maple Bacon Long John. Ever since my friend took a picture, I have been dying to try it. It was good, the sweet and salty mix had a nice flavor to it. The bacon had a hint of spice to it but still enough to give it a kick. That was quite a surprise! I also got the Salted Caramel Dark Chocolate Almond which I actually liked better. The chocolate was very rich and lots of almonds! The only dislike was that the dough is a bit thick for my tasting. I prefer the lightness of D&D better. Lastly, just those two donuts cost me over $6!! I was like WTF! They were good, but not $6 good! The free coffee was okay, but I'm sure they have better coffee options since they probably sampled their regular coffee. They also gave me three free donut holes. I ate the chocolate covered one which had a nice twist than the other plain chocolate and glazed, but they were all good. Overall, I like the creativity of each donut, but \u00a0I'm not sure if I would head out of my way to stop here again. Like I said before, I tried it and that's that. Another thing to note, the location is not the best for drivers. It's located in \u00a0Fulton Market which I'm not too familiar with, but the area is very grungy, industrial, and the parking is hard.

The waitress came promptly and we placed our drink orders and the cheese plate. It took about 15 minutes for the drinks to come, and even longer for the cheese plate. And let me be clear about this \"cheese plate\". There was literally four tiny triangles of cheese. Total. We were literally enjoying \"nibbles\" of cheese. Not quite what we were hoping for. Also, once we had our drinks and the \"cheese plate\" it was very evident that the four of us and our food were not going to fit on the two top. We asked if we could bring up another table, and while we were obliged, the server seemed annoyed.After we ordered our drinks, we noticed that the waitress had also taken our menus away, and we had to ask for them to be returned so we could actually order the meal. The other members of my party ordered a variety of plates, including the beef special, which was supposed to have peaches. No peaches could be found. I ordered the octopus and gnocchi, and while it was okay, it was nothing I would consider returning for.Overall, for a Fulton Market restaurant, I found the Betty to be rather pedestrian and the service to be sub par.

The recommendation was a shinning success! The Betty is a quaint bar with a great cocktail selection and a great, hip atmosphere.

I personally had the Life During War Time made with genever, green tea syrup, aperol, and fennel bitters. It was well balanced and the perfect blend of aroma and spices. I highly recommend this cocktail to those who love anise flavors but want something more subdued.For food we went with a pair of small plates and one large plate that my wife and I shared. We ordered Shishito Peppers, Kampaci Crudo, Pierogi, and Lamb with falafel. The stars of our meal were the Kampaci Credo and Pirogi by far, while the peppers and lamb left us with something to be desired. The peppers just really felt like they were missing something because the dish honestly felt like I was munching on a bowl of green salad. The lamb had a very small portion of falafel served with it, and it was over done and slightly bland.On the other side of the spectrum, our Kampaci Crudo was prepared delightfully. The ceviche was well executed, and I loved the pairing of small bits of watermelon, serrano, cucumber, mango, and beets. The pierogi was spot on, and I loved the addition of sausage under each pirogi. The addition of mushroom was a bit odd, but I couldn't really taste it anyways!For dessert we ordered the peach cobbler. The top was a little burn (too much caramelization!), but it was overall an okay option. I just expected more from what we were paying.The service was on point and attentive. I don't think we felt like the server was hovering either. The music was 70s and 80s rock, which our party loved. The drinks coupled with the soundtrack were the real stars of the night.

No, the description was accurate--it was really cream cheese and jam which everyone has in their fridge. The waldorf salad didn't have any flavor. The server also recommended the cassoulet, so we gave it a shot. But the black eyed peas were not cooked evenly, so some were hard and others were mushy.

The highlight of dessert was the whipped cream which came on the side for the cobbler.Because we were seated at \u00a0a small cocktail table, it could only fit two dishes at a time.

Can you bring us the check? Then she comes back with it, returns 5 mins later, takes the check booklet, doesn't ask us what we want done (split it, all on one etc), runs by without stopping, then returns 2 mins later asking what we wanted to do. Duh. Why don't you slow down and we would have told you what we wanted to do if you actually STOPPED when you picked up the check with our CCs.

We came with a party of 8 for a birthday and the bar gave us some nice shots to toast the birthday boy. When we were seated, the waiter knew everything about the menu and was willing to go line by line explaining what was on the menu to us. He's apparently worked with the chef for many years and understands the ingredients he likes to use and how he likes to prepare food.Ambiance: the place itself is small, it can't seat more than 70 people and I'm being generous. To me, this really speaks to the care involved in preparing the food. It's well seasoned using unique ingredients and was really a special meal. They use real candles for low lighting and it has a rustic type feel to the tables as they're made from refurbished wood. The restaurant is great for groups because their menu is really built for sharing.Parking: No valet but there's street parking you can find for free on both cross streets if you're lucky. You might circle a bit, or take a cab/uber.Food: we ordered basically half the menu and split it for the table. Fried Cauliflower - we ordered one and it was so tasty we had to order a second! A little spicy but barely; the creaminess of the aioli cuts the spice.Kale Salad - very yummy and even those who don't like kale enjoyed it. The creamy dressing was a little heavy for me but I ate it anyway.La Bomba Rice - YUM! Make sure you get some of the crispy leaks on your plate for that crunch.Whole Fried Fish - our waiter let us know that the chef is known for his whole fish preparations. When they bring the fish to the table, they'll let you know how you're supposed to cut your portion. It was light and flaky, some type of fish that's similar to a sea bass. I enjoyed the flavor it was different from any fish I'd had before.Rabbit Coxinha - these croquettes were good especially for my second time trying rabbit. I wasn't sure if I would like it. The meat, spices and cheese are all pureed then fried so if you're weird about texture, you should still be ok eating these. It sits on a bed of the frisee and mustard which was delicious & added a nice sour flavor to the food (but just a touch. It isn't overwhelming)Braised Pork Shank - also, ridiculously good! The meat was falling off the bone, people. I need you to understand that I'm not even a fan of pork shank and I licked all the juice off my fork. If you're a meat eater, try it out.Black Beans & Rice - pretty standard. They were tasty but there's not a lot you can do to make this dish over the top amazing.Empanada - just, wow. SO GOOD. I let out a literal, 'oh my God!' when I bit into this. We got the meat kind and you can't taste the ham, it just has a smokey flavor.

We recently returned from a trip to South America and wanted to try Chicago's version. It was pretty darn good, and I love how creative their menu is! La Sirena Clandestina is located on Fulton Market in the West Loop. The restaurant itself is small and intimate with a bar in the front and high ceilings. Atmosphere is rustic chic. Unfortunately they have a metal ceiling, making acoustics a bit poor. Sound control could have been better, and we were speaking loudly for the first half of our meal until the crowd thinned.We each started with a cocktail. Their pisco sour is to die for. I could drink this all night every night. For dinner, we decided to share all our dishes as a table and we started out with the kale salad. It's a basic salad but the dressing is delicious. Portion size was very generous and there was plenty for the four of us. Afterward, we each ordered an empanada. The flavors of the evening were sweat potato and black bean. I loved the sweet potato, while other members of our group preferred the black bean. We also ordered the cheesy bread. These are really just a small bite each (an order came with 4, one-bite size bread balls), but a nice taste nonetheless.For main courses, we tried the tuna steak, hanger steak, pork shoulder, and the moqueca. We also ordered a side of rice and beans. All the entrees were fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the moqueca, which was a rice and seafood stew with head on praws and clams. The seafood was extremely fresh and portion size was again, very generous. The tuna was served tartare and melted in your mouth. Finally, the pork shoulder was extremely tender and served with some delicious potatoes and greens to top it off. If coming with a group, do keep in mind that portions are quite generous, and you don't necessarily need an entree / person.We finished up with alfajores, and these were delicious.

It's a fairly interesting offering they have, from soups, breakfast plates, to day-old cookies that they sell at a discount ($1).The two times I visited on my trip were mainly for sausages and takeout sandwiches. I tried their \"Da Grinder\", which was a medley of salamis and cheese, on a French baguette. The meats were salty, toned down by the mildness of the cheese, all accented by the crustiness of the bread. Not too shabby. The sandwich came with a bag of Deep River chips and a pickle spear. I also recommend getting the duck prosciutto and the green chile sausage. I wasn't exactly sure how to prepare them, but the cashier/host gave some good recommendations, and it turned out great. One thing I will have to say is that you should avoid the chicken salad. The chicken was a a bit on the dry side, and while they do use quality ingredients (radishes, homemade buttermilk dressing, and black chickpeas), the portion is also pretty small for $15. Overall, the place is great for some specialty meats, or a high quality sandwich.

Thus, I was already destined to enjoy Publican Quality Meats (PQM, for short), Kahan's salumi-slash-sandwich shop and Publican spin-off.The closest proxy to PQM is Cochon Butcher in New Orleans, an ungodly good salumi-slash-sandwich shop that specializes in all things cured between two delicious slices of carb. Cochon Butcher is better than PQM, but I can't hardly think of another place I've liked better than the Butcher. In other words, putting PQM in a second-tier isn't an indictment.My one issue with PQM is what appears to be a lack of communication between the two halves. PQM's sandwiches don't seem to take full advantage of the delightful charcuterie available to them. In fact, PQM's most well-known sandwich, the \"Return of the Gyro,\" stuffs its pita with braised pork belly, something more associated with Publican proper rather than PQM. Again, I'm not hating. This wrap is damn good, ranking amongst the best \"sandwiches\" I've had in Chicago.The remainder of its menu is highly rotational, and maybe I just keep coming at the wrong times, but I'd love to see a muffaletta, a pastrami on rye, an Italian grinder, anything that's just simple meat, cheese, bread, and a couple condiments. Sure, a chicken parm sounds darn good, but that's not why I'm drooling puddles staring at your meat case, PQM.OK, mini-rant over. Everything else about PQM is fantastic. It's a little jarring first walking in, inundated with meat cases with hefty price tags. Here's the tips. If you're getting a sandwich or prepared foods to go, go to the middle cashier directly. If you're picking out sliced meats, head left. If you plan to sit and dine, head right (or to the far end, depending on the door you've entered). Once that moment of zen has passed, you'll feel more relaxed.For salumi orderers, there's plenty to choose from, but try to pick the stuff (labeled with PQM) smoked in-house. PQM has variants of just about everything under the sun, and I've never been disappointed by anything I've taken home. For restaurant-goers, somebody should get the Return of the Gyro, but from there I leave it to you. Like I said, my preference would be to get something with meat available at the butcher, but that's just me. Whatever you get, it will not suck.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 14]}, "13": {"description": "I have been to the Publican thrice for brunch now and I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread... Until last Friday when my friends and I ended up at PQM after being quoted an hour and a half wait time at Little Goat. I say \"ended up\" but I really mean we're soooo lucky to walk in, sit down, and immediately begin stuffing our faces with some of the finest charcuterie I've had in Chicago aside from Hopleaf and Gather. It had big heaping portions so all three of us felt like we had plenty to taste. I started with the Pok Pok Gose cocktail which was a super refreshing summery gin drink. My boyfriend got the Bloody Mary which was similar to the one across the road at the Publican, with a Miller High Life beer back instead of a draft (champagne of beers--way classier). The guys got the pork belly gyros and they must have been amazing because I didn't even get offered a bite, and I'm usually able to steal one! I was able to taste the slaw that came with the gyro and it was amazing--light and vinegar based and crunchy. I ordered the smoked salmon plate which had ridiculously good salmon. The only weird thing was the charcuterie actually took longer than our main dishes to come out so we were awkwardly eating everything at once. But geez louise was it good!!

Because it is a meat shop, we decided to order the three types of charcuterie for an appetizer. We got the coppa di testa, duck rilette, and pate, and the dish came with different types of mustards, pickles, peppers, and bread. The rilette was surprisingly fantastic, and the bread was toasted and drizzled with olive oil. Preparation and care into their food is obviously seen, and this was the perfect start to our meal.For my entree, I got the Butcher's breakfast which includes sausage, bacon, bread, two sunny side up eggs, and chorizo? hash. Everything was a little on the greasy side which is expected as it is bacon and a bunch of meats, but it was amazing. The sausage was so flavorful, and the chorizo hash had soft potatoes and crunchy bits with a hint of meat in the taste. So good. The plate was overall very well structured, and I surprisingly finished everything on there. I also tried my friend's chickpea soup which was good, but nothing extraordinary.This location really does serve quality meats, and it surpassed my expectations!

The go juice is made with coffee, espresso, honey, and angostura bitters. The porchetta sandwich was absolutely phenomenal; it's served only on Saturdays after 12. We saw the butcher bring out the entire roast on a large cutting board. The meat is juicy, succulent, and tender. The sandwich is served red onion, pickles, aioli, mustard on a ciabatta bun. The porchetta portion was huge! We had difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating it. The onions and pickles gave it some acidity to help balance out the fatty delicious meat. Comes served with a side of chips. The charceuterie plate was comprised of 3 types of house-made sausages served on a bed of red peas, pickled cabbage and mustard. They were all delicious; but my favorite was probably the cajun blanc sausage followed closely by the cajun boudin. I forgot what the other one we had was called :/ It all ate quite well with the peas and pickled cabbage and our fried eggs :)I would absolutely recommend PQM to anyone looking for a casual, delicious meal.

Because it is a meat shop, we decided to order the three types of charcuterie for an appetizer. We got the coppa di testa, duck rilette, and pate, and the dish came with different types of mustards, pickles, peppers, and bread. The rilette was surprisingly fantastic, and the bread was toasted and drizzled with olive oil. Preparation and care into their food is obviously seen, and this was the perfect start to our meal.For my entree, I got the Butcher's breakfast which includes sausage, bacon, bread, two sunny side up eggs, and chorizo? hash. Everything was a little on the greasy side which is expected as it is bacon and a bunch of meats, but it was amazing. The sausage was so flavorful, and the chorizo hash had soft potatoes and crunchy bits with a hint of meat in the taste. So good. The plate was overall very well structured, and I surprisingly finished everything on there. I also tried my friend's chickpea soup which was good, but nothing extraordinary.This location really does serve quality meats, and it surpassed my expectations!

When we talked to the girl at the counter, she seemed a bit confused and mentioned that we could sit in the dining area and order.When we ordered in the dining area, I asked for roast beef only with horseradish sauce. She didn't seem very sure about it but then said she could bring a plate of it, no problem. When my daughter ordered a roast beef sandwich that was not on the menu, it seemed to cause some confusion. My daughter, the ever loving negotiator, simply asked that if she went to the deli and ordered a roast beef sandwich, if they could make it and asked why they wouldn't be able to make it for the dining area. Ugh. Eventually all was figured out and she had a plate of roast beef, cheddar wheeze, lettuce, salami, and sourdough bread for a DIY sandwich plate, but it was strange to not be able to order simple things that were clearly in the deli, in the dining area.At this point, my son decided he wasn't going to eat...All of that aside, I would definitely go back for the deli meats and some of the goodies in the refrigerator.

The go juice is made with coffee, espresso, honey, and angostura bitters. The porchetta sandwich was absolutely phenomenal; it's served only on Saturdays after 12. We saw the butcher bring out the entire roast on a large cutting board. The meat is juicy, succulent, and tender. The sandwich is served red onion, pickles, aioli, mustard on a ciabatta bun. The porchetta portion was huge! We had difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating it. The onions and pickles gave it some acidity to help balance out the fatty delicious meat. Comes served with a side of chips. The charceuterie plate was comprised of 3 types of house-made sausages served on a bed of red peas, pickled cabbage and mustard. They were all delicious; but my favorite was probably the cajun blanc sausage followed closely by the cajun boudin. I forgot what the other one we had was called :/ It all ate quite well with the peas and pickled cabbage and our fried eggs :)I would absolutely recommend PQM to anyone looking for a casual, delicious meal.

I wanted them cut. I love how my short nail beds look after I get a mani because the removal of my cuticles just makes my hands look better.

By this time, he had also clasped my hands together while wrapping them in a steaming hot towel, sprayed my nails with alcohol, and buffed again. I was confused about this process. Everything got real clear though when working on my SECOND cuticle, HE CUT ME! I guess he was trying to cut a hang nail (that I didn't know I had; there certainly wasn't one bothering me), and when I squealed in pain, he grabbed a tiny bottle of turquoise stuff and squeezed a glob on me while answering my query with, \"it's antiseptic.\" I just about screamed in pain then, while jumping up to rinse the BLOOD OFF MY FINGER. I went to the sink and washed and rinsed for a while, but it still bled. I told Twon I was done, asked how much I owed, and told him he shouldn't have been cutting so roughly.

I had no idea the Small Bar franchise was soccer centric, but it was a welcomed change especially with World Cup fever in the air. Also, when they say \"Small\" Bar, they mean it. It's not a big space but it doesn't need to be. There is a nice long bar on one side, a few large bench tables on the other side and table-tops in between.

While the food wasn't bad, I'd make a return trip focusing on drinking and not eating. As for the food, we started with a bowl of their \"fabled\" veggie chili. I love chili so I was a little disappointed when the bowl resembled a bean salad more than chili. I love beans, but chili to me is still tomato based with onions, spice and cheese. It also came with a mound of sour cream (to each their own I respect), which kind of defeats the purpose of a vegetarian healthy dish. I enjoyed the beans, flavors and cheese, it just wasn't what I would call veggie chili. We were craving pizza so we browsed the very appealing pizza list and went with the BBQ chicken. The pizza's are 14'', so they serve more than two people, and cost $14. I was impressed with the pizza, but not blown away. Very good for bar food, especially something other than pepperoni or plain. I forgot that BBQ pizza is hard to eat a lot of, and we should have ordered something simpler for our own tastes. I would be curious to try their other pies, especially vegetarian focused options. The beer was great, the service attentive and friendly, and the food above average for bar standards. I think the value is only mediocre. I'm also very surprised that there are no daily food specials, something that cash strapped Chicago bar goers seek.

Before people load up on the bus, they get loaded at the bar and all meet up there. Small Bar is a very good soccer bar since they will open up early to let us addicted soccer fans come watch soccer early in the morning. 6:45am beer is not usually everyone's first choice, so they have plenty of coffee ready!With two 65\" TVs mounted on the wall, it's hard to miss any details of the big game should you choose to watch it there. But let's say you're hungry, well then it's time to dig into brunch! I've always rocked the Countrymen's skillet and like it well done because it's loaded up with egg, taters, veggies and will do the trick so early in the morning. Not in the mood for eggs and potato so early in the morning? They'll even let you bite into the rest of the menu. As for me, I've taken a shot at the Bacon and Egger, which is a fierce burger ready to knock your socks off. Oh, so now you are looking for a drink in this venue? I'd have to say my favorite beer in here's the Half Acre Daisy Cutter on tap, but I've also had some wicked Spaten Octoberfest in liter steins enough to knock your socks off.

The difference in power between my left and right lens in the monotype vision lenses was too severe for me to see well, so Dr. Ortiz sent them back for 're-tooling.'

I accidently scratched my eye and knew it would need some attention. Not my first rodeo so I knew I probably needed drops. Being a new resident in the area, I needed to find a new optometrist. I chose this practice since it was conveniently down the street from my apartment and had stellar reviews. First off, the receptionist was probably not the right fit for the job. I guess its my job to initiate the conversation. No greeting, half fake-smile, blank stare, sorry to say- seemed a little stuck up like she was too good for the job. She wasn't rude, just unapproachable. All around received bad vibes from her. I told her that I was checking in. I did the whole process of being a new patient, paid, and waited. BTW, just to test her, I was extremely nice and smiled (plenty) hoping I'd get a better attitude or even a genuine smile out of her. Maybe she was having a bad day? Still not an excuse. Don't remember the optometrist I had. He was an older gentlemen. He confirmed I had a corneal abrasion and would prescribe eye drops. Quick and easy. However, the part I was confused about was him needing me to come in 1-3 more times so he can check my eye to make sure it doesn't get worse ... uh .. never, in the past did I ever had to do that even with a more severe eye abrasions ( I usually RECEIVE a call from an optician checking on me) and drops usually does the job. I am a busy person and I would like to avoid additionally visits if it wasn't necessary. Whatever, 1-3 days seemed major for a \u00a0scratch so maybe it was something he noticed that I never experienced. Although it didn't seem to be getting worse, I went in for a second appointment anyway. Same receptionist, same attitude. I paid my $35 co-pay and saw the dr. However, I didn't even go to the back room .. the Dr. took one look- said it was healing. Gave me a sales pitch on glasses over contacts. Which I declined since I already had glasses. I was with him for maybe 1 minute. He then told me to make another appointment to come back for another check up! Are you serious, dude? So I can pay another $35 and see you less than a minute. No, thanks! He didn't even need to use his special equipment to examine my eye. I don't think another appointment was necessary. It is a BIG waste of my time and money! I told the receptionist I would just call and give them an update on the progress. But she insist that I should make an appointment. I get why they hired her on .. she doesn't take no for an answer. Told her I'd call in to make an appointment because I didn't know my schedule. I didn't. I also never received a call from them about the healing of my eye. If my family eye practice needed me to physically come in-and I didn't, I would have at least gotten a phone call. If I have the option, I'd give them .5 a star.

Maybe the most incredible thing about Chris is his pricing-framing can be a very expensive service, and because of this I sought cheap alternatives, like Target frames, for my art. But even if you don't have a Groupon or Gilt City voucher for CMM, Chris will work with you on the price until it is a manageable number that you're happy with. What's more, he always gets the work done in the timeframe he quotes, and the one instance he was behind by a couple days, he called to apologize and explain. As far as I can tell Chris does all the work himself, and he is accountable and dependable. I can't recommend Chris at CMM Framing highly enough.

The addition of stores has caused pricing to become a bit more competitive. Additionally, if I am not finding the prices I want, I have options for my order. I now have stores that sell groceries with no markup. Pretty fantastic! I have found that some stores, that do markup, have items at less than shelf price.

I place exact substitutes for every item. I expect NO ONE to be a mind reader or guess what I would choose. I don't leave it up to chance. If they don't have what I want, don't purchase anything.

Instacart lets you select replacements for items that might be out of stock, and you can request that they call you to discuss replacements.

The shoppers have always been extremely pleasant with both services.Areas where Instacart falls a little short: prices and sales. Peapod has an extensive list of specials and sale items. Instacart has nothing of the sort. No sales, no specials, and it can occasionally be a touch more expensive than in-store prices. And that's really the only shortfall that I've found with Instacart.

However, my no chip mani was done by a nice lady who seemed to have little experience doing nails. She did a wonderful job filing and buffing, and was kind enough to ask if the shape was fine and if there was anything I'd like her to fix. But when it came to the painting, things started to fall apart. First off, she did just the pinky and ring finger to start -- so this meant 1 layer on the left pinky + ring finger, then UV lamp, then 1 layer on the right pinky + ring finger, then UV lamp, 2nd layer on the left then UV lamp, 2nd layer on right then UV lamp, etc. Only after 3 layers did she move on to the middle and index finger for each hand -- rinse and repeat the process described earlier. And then finally moved on to the thumbs. So as you can imagine, this meant \u00a018 rounds of the UV lamp since it was for 3 layers, two nails a time. (If she had done all fingers together, it would've simply been 6 rounds of UV for 3 layers.)Moving on, when all nails were colored, she did the top coat in one go (thank God), only to take on the color again to GO OVER the top coat with another layer of color to fill in any spots she missed. She then proceed to layer on another top coat. All in all, I had my hands under the UV lamp at least 24 times. Not to mention she then did the edges, which asked for another round of UV. That makes 26. At least she was thorough.If you've been counting, that's SIX coats of thick no chip, and of course, my nails came out looking like marshmallows. Not to mention this took me 1.5 hours. They didn't have a drying station and so I was asked to wait another 30 minutes for my toes to dry naturally. In sum, it was 2 hours for a no chip mani + pedi.*Not to mention the strange booking policy. I had a Gilt City voucher and this was the third time I had tried to make an appointment at least a week in advance. The first two times they were fully booked.

They offered me a cold diet coke during my cut! What a delight on this 95 degree day.

After recently moving to the West Loop, I read reviews for FM Hair and decided I would give it a try. I booked an appointment with Marco (male, early 50's) based on the receptionist's advice. It was a WONDERFUL experience. They have a very polished salon and a cute waiting area. Parking was a breeze! The receptionist was super friendly along with everyone else who worked there. I was offered something to drink as soon as I walked in. There was a selection of up to date magazines laid out. It was the perfect combination of a stylish salon without any of the pretentiousness that you often find in bit city salons. Marco, my stylist was SO great. Full of energy but also down to earth. He asked me all about how I wear my hair on a regular basis and what I wanted to do differently. He made suggestions for what he thought would work best while keeping in mind what my personal preferences were. He explained to me what he wanted to do and what products he thought would work best. He made sure I was comfortable with everything he did! The shampoo session was amazing! I received a scalp massage while at the shampoo bowl-so relaxing and a wonderful added bonus. Marco took a lot of time while cutting my hair making sure it was just as he (and I) wanted it to be. He also paid close attention while styling my hair. The blowout was FABULOUS! I rarely like how anyone but me styles my hair, but he did a great job!Marco told me about each product that he used (which I loved-but didn't buy...YET), but he also asked me about the products that I currently used. And he actually complimented me on them rather than suggesting immediately that I buy the ones he used-I appreciated not being pushed! It was the best Chicago Salon experience I have had to date!

I purchased a $25 rack of ribs along with some other items like bacon and sausage. This purchase was on a Tuesday. On Sunday I decided to make the ribs. As soon as I opened the package there was a foul smell. Not to mention the slimy feel fo the ribs. Ugh! They were super spoiled. I was pretty upset so I decided to call Paulina, but guess what, they're closed on Sundays. Go figure. On Monday I was ready to bring the ribs back to the store, but I decided to call first. I asked for the manager and the guy who answered said I could talk to him. Perhaps I should have insisted on a manager, but I decided to plead my case anyway. Basically this guy said that their meat only last 2 days tops. What??? He went on to say that I should have asked about how long it would last. Who on earth would do that? I actually told the butcher that helped me in the store that this was my first time there you'd think he would have said something if spoiling is an issue. In any case, this guys said NO REFUNDS.

Beyond disappointing meat, overpriced, and underwhelming service. I looked through everything they had and not having any filet mignon, which is what I was looking for, and everything being pre-cut should have been a giveaway to their lack of quality. I figured out what I wanted and took a number.Let me preempt this with something to stop you from even walking in the door. They do not have most cuts of beef you probably want when thinking \"I'm going to grill a steak\". They didn't even have my top 3, so I should have walked out the door. If you want something other than beef or low quality beef at high prices then this is the place for you. You can get the same quality meat at half the price at Jewel and honestly better quality at the same price at Whole Foods. Otherwise, there are much better butchers in the city.They had a lot of people working behind the counter and half of them weren't checking ticket numbers, they were just taking the person in front of them so I ended up waiting longer by not being rude. Then when they call your number they do it twice and if you don't immediately tell them what you want they move on to the next person, which I had to scream out \"excuse me I'm right here trying to talk to you\".Once I finally got help, I asked a very simple question for someone who should be a butcher. \"What is the difference between YOUR choice and prime\". Because we were talking a $12/lb difference, which is drastic for a ribeye. Now a real butcher should be able to give me specifics, where it came from, the specific cut, fat content, and so on. His answer and only answer was \"well a lot\". I asked if he could tell me anything about the meat and he told me \"we're very busy so what do you want\". I should have walked out.From my point of view their \"choice\" cuts and \"prime\" cuts looked exactly the same. No difference in redness or fat content. I opted for the prime as I would assume it's higher quality and I paid over $50 for two pieces. Which is completely insane after tasting it.When I got it home and put on a dry rub I noticed it was very very firm. Before I cooked it, it was a 3/4 inch steak. After, it was like a pancake. I cooked it medium rare and did a somewhat perfect job along with the same preparation I do every time I cook steak. Hard to perfect cook a steak when it deflates to half the size. It was slightly chewy and not very soft. The flavor was horrible. It tasted kind of like skirt steak, but really cheap skirt. It was honestly the worst steak I've made and I've purchased from Jewel. I always do very minimal spices so I can taste the meat... I had to smother it with spices to even enjoy it.All of their prices are extremely high and their food does not look good. It all looks overly prepared and low quality. I didn't see a single thing in there that made my mouth water. My go-to butcher has meat cuts that look beautiful, but they are on the other side of the city. They put this place to shame in quality, price, and service. A butcher should be able to tell you every detail about a cut, how to prepare it, and cut the meat fresh based on what you're looking to do with it.

I stopped in to make an appt and it turned out they weren't yet set up to accept my vision insurance. However, their sister store - Eye Care Center (located only two blocks away) did in fact accept it so they directed me there. Vision Boutique is what you'd expect from any indy eye place - nice selection of frames, boutique atmosphere, etc - the staff was really friendly and helpful even though I wasn't going to be utilizing them directly so I had good expectations for Eye Care Center. I made an appt for a few days later and one for Amy as well who decided after all these years to finally have her eyes checked. (insert joke here...) Anyway, ECC was a complete 180 from VB. It was located on the 3rd floor of an office building and shared office space with a dental practice (weird). It also had the appearance of what I would expect gov't subsidized health care for illegal immigrants to look like. The selection of glasses were decent (definitely on the lower end but they did have an ok selection of designer frames for Amy to check out while waiting for the Dr). The Dr himself deserves 5 stars. He was friendly, knowledgeable, etc and even seemed out of place in his own store. Both of our exams were standard, quick, and efficient and then it was time to move on to one of the sales associates for my contacts and Amy's glasses ... The girl who \"helped us\" was probably one of the worst sales people I have ever had the displeasure of working with. Maybe she's used to working with a different kind of clientele - one that is uneducated or unfamiliar but after 30 seconds of me giving her background (been wearing contacts for 15+ years, able to get them online, etc, etc) - she should have gotten the hint and shut down her bs. Instead, she tried to railroad me into spending money over and above my insurance plan which was completely unnecessary. I know how many fk'n boxes I need to last me a year and I also know that I can pay $19 online for the same thing you're trying to rob me for $31 for. Long story short - I left with 2 boxes of contact vs 6 boxes as she claimed my insurance didn't cover anything else (which I knew was completely false). Went home, spoke to my insurance company - called her back livid, and sure enough 4 more boxes were going to be available to me in a few days. She tried to roll me for $200+ and the whole thing ended up costing me $6. It's pretty pointless to try to scam someone who is clearly knowledgeable and although I truly liked the Dr/owner - I wonder if this is a reflection on him as well. (I'll give him the benefit of the doubt).Amy's glasses were less of an issue but took over two weeks to make which seemed excessive. Although I liked the Dr - there's just too many options in the eye care world to be a repeat customer at a place that left such a bad taste in my mouth for something that should have been clear cut and dry.

Definitely order it with your chicken, and it comes with a take-home cup. They have Louisiana hot sauce, which you don't even really need since the chicken was delicious on its own.Chicken gets five stars. Everything was so fresh and came out piping hot, the skin a golden brown crisp - like it was breaded and fried upon ordering. Since they cook to order, your chicken will take a little longer to be ready than say, KFC, but Gus' cannot be compared to a fast food chain.

There are no words to know how ecstatic I am that there is another fantastic fried chicken joint in Chicago and that I have discovered it. Between Harold's and Gus's WFFC, I can sleep at night knowing that whenever I need a taste of the south, all I need is to hop on the 66 bus and within 20 minutes I am home again. Figuratively.Location/Decor - tucked away on a strip on Fulton Market, Gus's WFFC is strategically placed out of the way of touristy destinations. This feat I particularly LOVE. You have to have done your research to know about this place because one does not simply \"stumble upon\" Gus's. I LOVE this neighborhood. Don't really know what the technical name is called (West Loop or West Town) but the industrial aesthetic I get from all the lofts and warehouses...it is goals. I would love to move here. The inside of Gus's matches its surrounding as well. Exposed piping in the ceiling, brick and wood planks against the walls. Rustic bars and bar tables and stools. I love it. Service - I had to dock a half star for the service. There were simply way too many patrons for the amount of wait/bar staff at Gus's. It took 10 minutes just for my waiter to ask for my drink. And 15 minutes after that before he got around to asking what we wanted to order. The food came out with haste, but the process just took entirely too long. It took even longer before he came to give our check and return our cards. It was only because it was super busy. That is a good thing and a bad thing. For the reasons I just wrote.Drinks - There is a full bar here. Unless someone buys me drinks however, I choose not to imbibe. I settled with a sweet tea (yum!) and my friend settled with a fountain drink. Standard.Food - im crying thinking about how amazing this chicken is.*2 piece white (one breast/one wing): This is the juiciest chicken with the crispiest skin. These people truly know how to brine! The flavor was ALL the way through the chicken! SO many times I have eaten fried chicken and people neglect to brine and the only flavor rests within the skin alone. For huge pieces of breasts - such as the ones at Gus's - this is problematic. But Gus's did it right! I drenched mine in hot sauce although there was just enough kick without it. But the hot sauce set it right over the top. 5 stars.*Mac and Cheese: SUPERB!!! Its not the traditional mac and cheese of the south but it is definitely still fantastic! I am used to having mac and cheese baked and crispy topping. Not sure if they do this here, but the topping wasnt crispy but had gooey melted cheese sprinkled over. NO processed cheese! All quality. 5 stars.*Cole Slaw. wonderful! No complaints. Standard. 3 stars.*bread: I wish places like this would either choose yeast rolls or biscuits. This slice of toast ruined the bread portion of the dinner. 1 star. *Chocolate Chess Pie - warm, gooey, creamy. A brownie in a pie. The crust was flavorless - which sucks - but the filling mixed with the ice cream provided for a great treat. The ice cream was hard as a brick but because the pie was hot, it melted easily.Price - less than twenty dollars with tip. superb.I will definitely return.", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 2, 9]}, "35": {"description": "Just a bit spicy, crispy and fried up to order, Gus's is the new place in Chicago to sample us some Tennessee-an fried chicken.

Ordered 3 piece dark with fries and M&C as the side. Now every one who has ever had my fried chicken say it's probably the best they ever had. I am ashamed to say I would gladly take Gus's over mine ANY day. This shit was juicy, salty, had a nice spicy kick without being too spicy where it impedes in stuffing your face. The crust was thin and crackling. There is not a single thing I can complain about regarding the chicken.Even the sides had a level of execution that could only come from a true passion in the cuisine and process. The mac and cheese had noodles that were still toothsome, fries hand cut and fluffy, greens tender and flavorful. Compare this to a hipster hellhole like HBFC where they distinguish their food through gimmicks and naming it a particular way. You don't need honey butter on chicken that already has tremendous flavor. You don't need pimento in your M&C if the cheese flavor comes through.I wish there was a little more value built into the food, but it's to be expected for the area.

I should clarify this is because of what happened with the hostess, not the assistant manager or other service, and that the food is probably about 4.5 stars if I rated that separately. I usually dont like to be unpleasant for fear of getting spit in my food but this one bothered me a lot.TL;DR food good, waiting experience badWe put our names down on the waitling list for 4 for dinner (no reservations) and was told the wait would be about 30 minutes. We also had to wait outside because it's a small place and was told it was a fire code violation. That is fine no problem, mind you it is the first day that it started snowing. When we were walking outside we see a few other couples come in and a family of 4 and also put their names on the waiting list. While we were waiting outside in the cold, we see that the family gets to wait inside for 20 minutes. That is annoying since it is a fire code but understandable because they have 2 kids, whatever this is no problem. We decide to stand closer to the door and begin to walk inside, the hostess begins to seat the family of four, and this is where we are like what the heck. We were definitely here before the family and we have the same party size so I ask the hostess what's going on. She tells me, oh yea oops, we have space over there at the community table if you want.What the heck, first of all, you didn't tell us our table was ready. Second of all this family has been given a standalone table which would have been nice for us. No one came out to tell us even though we were standing outside for 20 minutes and what the freak is the point of your waiting list if you're not going to use it. And then when I was trying to ask her for her name for this review, she told me i was threatening her so I was like wtf and we walked to our seats at the community table. Later while we were sitting at the community table, the assistant manager came to apologize and was very nice and I appreciate that which redeemed some of the night. But I wish the hostess had owned up to her mistake, but she was just so dodgy, even trying to put the blame on us for either not having a complete party even though she was the one who didn't even bother to check on us or let us know. I wish I could get her name but I know they were trying to protect her from this rage review. she had short hair and looked young and probably never had to be an adult before.Food:we had brussel sprouts and fried chicken appetizers. A little salty but who knew I could like brussel sproutsTakoyaki octopus balls were good, a little soft but each place makes it differently so nothing wrong here.Shrimp and Fried chicken buns, Shrimp was amazing can't go wrong with this, I didn't get to try the chicken.Ramen was good, we had spicy chicken something and oshioka something but they were both really good. I really really love the soft boiled egg, my girlfriends spicy chicken ramen was missing the egg but whatever I was tired of starting shit. The egg is probably the trademark of this place if I were to coin it. The pork belly I got was also not all fat and was delicious.Green tea mochi and Black sesame mochi were both amazing treats.This ramen place is a much needed improvement over all the other ramen places in the chicago area.

So now i always buy a day early , because fresh chicken like that needs to sit on ice for at least 3 hours before you cook it or else it will be tough to chew . I gave alliance 5 stars based on there great friendly atmosphere , there product of course , and of course healthy Amish chicken , Also , on the Jewish holiday they have a rabbi come in and butcher the chickens because they don't sell pork . And Jews don't eat pork , so it works out for them . Also for Muslims there is a Muslim butcher always on duty there . And of course for Christians there's always a christian butcher there also .

So I was a chain store grocery shopper. After finally getting fed up with the quality and price of Jewel, the hunt began for better meat. This place was close, promised high quality, had low prices and most importantly wasn't Jewel. I rolled over on Sunday and found easy parking on Chicago Ave. Street parking is free on Sunday, so I felt like today was going to be my day.

The chickens are in cages stacked against a very visible wall.Okay, time to put my big girl pants on. I walk to the counter and the man asked me what I wanted. At that moment a chicken clucked and my big girl pants fell off. I humblely told him this was my first visit. He asked if I wanted \" big or small.\" I said small. He then disappeared into the chicken wall and returned with a bird squawking and squirming beneath his grip. He weighed the bird and told me the price.He asked if I wanted the head and feet. I nearly tripped over my big girl pants in terror. I said no. He I nodded in agreement and the next time I saw the bird it was in a plastic bag. That's right. He gutted, plucked, and diced the bird into pieces within minutes. The entire experience took no more than 15 minutes and cost me 8.60.

I should first make the disclaimer that I have not actually eaten the chicken from this place, so my review is not based on the food itself. \u00a0The one time we went in, it was just to inquire about the prices ($1.69 a pound), and they only had one butchered chicken available. \u00a0The second time, my boyfriend actually went to purchase one because we were having guests over for dinner, and they didn't have *any* available. So, I guess staying stocked is not their strong point?There is, however, an abundance of live chickens which presumably eventually get butchered and sold, though not on demand. This is where I'm feeling kind of torn. \u00a0My understanding is that a freshly butchered chicken is orders of magnitude better than what you can get at the supermarket. \u00a0On top of that, I'd sooner eat one butchered here in a small local business using old fashioned methods rather than in some massive scary processing plant hundreds of miles away. \u00a0At the same time, the store touts that they sell poultry that is both \"organic\" and \"Amish.\" \u00a0If you've seen an Amish farm, you know that the animals are generally raised quite humanely in farms that look like picture book farms, and not in giant mechanized facilities. And of course, everyone loves organic, right? \u00a0So this is why it troubles me that the live chickens here are crowded into stacks and stacks of cages with the chickens practically on top of each other (think lobster tank) behind the counter. \u00a0There certainly isn't outdoor access or sunlight or anything you would associate with a humanely raised animal. \u00a0And just because the animals might have been sourced from an organic farm doesn't necessarily mean that they're receiving organic feed once or humane conditions in the store. Are they still organic then? \u00a0Do they arrive at the store as chicks or full-grown? How long are they in these conditions? \u00a0Anyway, like I said, I'm torn because organic, Amish chicken butchered locally is better than commercially produced poultry for so many reasons, and yet somehow the store doesn't seem to be living up to its promises.If I get the opportunity to purchase from there, I'll write an update.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 6, 18]}, "6": {"description": "I live in the near west suburbs but made the trip here to have my 3 backyard egg laying hens \"readied\" for the stock pot.
