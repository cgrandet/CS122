So it was recommended that I start going for massages at least once a month. I learned of Kimm and Infinite Touch from Groupon. The location was not too far from where I live in Hyde Park and I knew that parking would not be too difficult unlike if the location was downtown or on the North side. I really liked the fact that I was able to schedule my appointment online. It was extremely easy and convenient and I immediately received confirmation via email. Two days later, I received a confirmation call from Kimm. If you are looking for a very high end, frou-frou spa experience, then Infinite Touch is not for you. I am from the south side of Chicago, so I was not phased by the location on 79th St. If you're nervous about venturing into the south side (let's be honest, some people are) don't worry, Infinite Touch is located just a few blocks off the the expressway- it is very easy to get to (although you can easily miss it as there is not a sign that says \"Infinite Touch\" rather just the business logo) and there is ample street parking. I was immediately greeted by the receptionist upon entering. He took my coat and offered me something to drink. Again, it's a no-frills place however it was clean and modestly decorated. The new age music that was playing was a nice, relaxing touch. \u00a0By no means am I a massage therapy connoisseur, however I can't imagine a massage being any better than Kimm's. Kimm seemed to instinctively know where my trouble spots were without me even going into much detail other than a few questions answered on the first time client questionnaire. I have experienced less than stellar service from companies once they found out I was patronizing their establishment because of a Groupon deal. However, that was not the case at all with Kimm. I did not feel rushed or short changed in the least bit. Matter of fact, once my massage was over, Kimm went the extra mile by giving me a cupcake and mini bottle of champagne for my birthday which was that day! I highly recommend Kimm based on the actual massage and customer service. I have already scheduled my next massage and I look forward to being a long time client of Infinite Touch!", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 1, 1]}, "6": {"description": "Where do I begin.

However, \u00a0I must give accolades for the fact that extractions weren't that bad.

Make sure to wash your hair the night before if not you have to pay extra to have your hair washed. Straighten it if that's what you usually do (if you have curly hair).

This is the least irritating wax I've ever had and both women I've had wax my brows were very professional and ensured that that the end result was the best possible.I had a haircut here once (and by haircut, I mean trim) and I was really unimpressed. No shampoo, only a spritz which ended up backfiring because I have curly thick hair (which was straightened at the time) so bits and pieces started curling again so each strand was a different length which seemed to confuse her. The fact that she didn't see that coming doesn't speak well to her skill as a stylist. The price is what I'm used to when a shampoo is included. For the fact that she just trimmed by dry hair it was too much. Won't be doing that again.I've also had a massage here on one occasion and I would go back again.
