I would have given them 4 stars but you'll understand why.In my opinion, Margarita Pizza Makers/Chefs give me the feeling that they once worked at Italian Fiesta. If I were blind-folded and had to choose which one was from \u00a0I.F., I couldn't guess. The XL Pizza's are TRULY EXTRA LARGE. They're ingredients were fresh. I ordered a sausage/pepperoni for the kids and a sausage/mushroom/black olive for myself. EXCELLENT!!! I also ordered a 4 wing dinner that included fries and mostacholi and garlic bread. \u00a0If you're a fan of BIG/Full Figured Chicken wings this is the place for you. I prefer smaller wings however they could be seasoned a little better. The mostacholi was decent with plenty of meat in the sauce. Delivery was within an hour yet the Pizza wasn't piping hot. (I like to see steam). The only drawback is the pricing. While I am willing to pay for quality food, I spent $61.73 for 2 XL Pizzas, a 4 wing dinner, and delivery.", "rating": "3", "date": [2012, 2, 24]}, "3": {"description": "if you love Italian Fiesta, you will definitely love here! great Mexican food also.

I wanted to write about my favorite Chinese delivery place near my home. It is HUA'S Open Kitchen. \u00a0Located right next door to Gomez Tacos in near South Chicago. One of my favorite delivery options is Chinese takeout and Hua' s gives you a FREE egg roll or soda with $10.00 or more or \u00a0a FREE Small Shrimp Fried Rice with $20.00 or more purchase. The portions are large and I save mine for lunch the next day. I always order from their special combination plate section on the back of the menu. Almost all combos are $5.50 or less! They include 2 pc Crab Rangoon or 1 Egg Roll and a Shrimp Fried Rice or White rice with any of the following entrees: Vegetable Delight, Szechwan Beef or Chicken, Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pepper Steak, Shrimp Chop Suey, General Tso's Chicken. Kung Po Chicken, Mongolian Beef/Chicken, Shrimp Egg Foo Young (2), Fried Chicken Wings (6 pc) and my favorite Chicken with Cashew Nuts!The Chicken with Cashews was great. The gravy was not too thick and had a very light taste of soy. \u00a0It was more vegetable stock and plum sauce. It had a good mix of nuts to veggies which I like. Over all a good dish with lots of zucchini and carrots!I bet you to try and compare HUA's with Kwan's and you will see the difference.

The prices are right and the food is delicious and the portions are huge! I have yet to be disappointed from this place and I do hope that I never will be. Today I ordered the crab ragoon, which was a lot that I shocked myself when I couldn't finish it all. That's a sad day in my eating history. I always finish my crab ragoon but not today I guess. I also had the fried shrimp, which I come to realize that I am not a fan of. It was good, but it was more of a medium size shrimp that had been overly breaded took fool the eye into thinking that your eating a large or extra large shrimp when your not. So that was disappointing, it was good but not as good as I thought it would be. I also had the shrimp fried rice which was cooked to perfection and the shrimp and broccoli dish which was also good, However my only complaint is that the broccoli could have been cooked more. It was just a little too under done.I am going through a no meat phase in my life so this is why you see all of these seafood dishes plus I am a true fan of seafood so its ok.

Once inside of the gated parking lot the smell of Mexican cuisine hits you urging you to walk faster.  \u00a0 Walking into the restaurant it is a sight to see. Large wooden tables on one end and vibrant colorful tables on the other, traditional Mexican music coming from the juke box, and the smiling faces of everyone inside seemed so unreal. The art pieces hanging off the walls intrigued my eyes as I scanned the large room. The drastic contrast between inside and outside made it take a while to settle in and find a table. Decisions, decisions \u00a0 Once I made my seating decision, my smiling waitress then approached me with a menu and chips with salsa. The menu is well organized and filled with many authentic Mexican cuisines. Adding pictures of their cooked meals menu does a great job at accommodating non-Spanish speakers. With over fifty reasonably priced items to choose from I was not at all ready to place my order in a timely fashion.

Eventually I was drawn to their Cocula dinner meal, which offered one tamale, taco, and a tostada with a side of rice and beans.More please! \u00a0 As I glanced around at the wall paintings, my waitress reappeared to fill my drink without me having to call her over, and had a brief conversation with me. Unlike many big restaurants, my waitress was able to focus on my needs as a customer. After a short waiting time my food was ready. My waitress approached my table with my steaming hot meal. I took no time to dig into my delicious meal. The steak was hot and well seasoned to my likings. So much food on one plate was delightful to see especially for only $9.95. Is there room for nine more? \u00a0 While I enjoyed my meal I couldn't help but notice the large family sitting across from me ordering their food with three small children running around the table. \u00a0At one point one of the waitresses even encouraged the young girl to run faster. It was interesting to see this because in most restaurants families are encouraged to keep their children seated, but because this is a family restaurant the behavior was encouraged. Fant\u00e1stica! \u00a0 My experience at Cocula's Restaurant was one of the best I have had in a long time. Between family warmth, Mexican culture, tasty food, inexpensive prices, and the warm customer service I am not sure which I enjoy most. \u00a0Overall Cocula's Restaurant gets 5 out of 5 stars because they made sure to integrate Mexican culture in the customers dinning experience.

Commercial strip. There were few options up the strip, granted it was a Sunday evening. We passed Cocula + it's Chile's exterior a few times but were eventually won over by it's parking lot option + overall slim pickens elsewhere. First couple of thoughts upon entering Cocula: \"Did this used to be a Wendy's?\" + \"It's packed!\". A mix of good/bad signs, depending how you look at it. We found a booth + were soon handed our menus (their menus resemble that of a Mexican Denny's) + a basket of chips/salsa. The chips were a lot like Tostidos + the salsa was a standard red w/ a lot of cilantro thrown in perhaps to cover up the store bought flavor. I gave Cocula an extra star due to the fact that they not only had horchata but they had it by the PITCHER. I was sold! Sure, it wasn't the best horchata I've had but the pitcher option was a big selling point in my starved state. While we waited for our order, I noticed a girl no older than 9 eat an entire vat dressed in a goblet of dark red shrimp cocktail. She managed to pick out the tempting slices of avocado + left them to the side. I then looked behind Mike to see the couple seated behind us who I'm assuming had ordered a pitcher of Bloody Mary but it resembled Heinz 57, more so. I had ordered my usual veggie burrito w/ avocado (which they forgot). It arrived with a side of pasty beans + rice, which had three kernals of corn + two green peas. I was hungry so overlooked the redundancy of the rice/bean mix. The burrito was ok, no flavors really jumped out at me. Mike had ordered a steak burrito + was pleased with it's medium/well-done texture. I could have gone with more spice, something more memorable but my burrito definitely left me feeling full + I had to pass on the last cupful of horchata left in the pitcher.

They may need to add a little more inventory to so it looks more inviting, but if they are going for a gallery look, then they are right on the money.I did have a chance to talk to the owners (or a couple who worked there) and they seemed pretty stuck up when I asked about the difference between their store and the Kidrobot store in SF. Looks like they are very protective of their store. This store is way bigger than the Kidrobot store in SF and has the same items and more. I bought the Street Fighter and Futurama blind boxes. The prices were reasonable. Less than ten bucks for both. I can see the appeal of the blind box. You hate it, yet love it at the same time. The anticipation and excitement gets you. Once you open the box, you will either be extremely happy or disappointed. It's all in fun.

My last recent visit I got a No Chip Manicure and a Pedicure. \u00a0I noticed in less than 48hrs 2 of my nails started chipping. \u00a0I was very shock to experience this so I decided to send the salon a message, along with a picture of my nails. \u00a0Less than 2hrs later, a few more nails started to lift up and I was able to literally pull all of the No Chip off my hands without soaking them. \u00a0I also messaged the salon about this as well, in hopes they would reach out to me. It has been 2days so far and I have not recieved a response regarding my issue.  I read a review here on yelp from a recent customer who seemed to have had the same issue. \u00a0I'm not sure if something was done different than in the past, but my nails have never came off unless I soaked them in acetone. I was told that I probaly won't get a response back or get my nails fixed by previous customers (one being a friend I referred), because they have had the same problems. At this moment I'm more so hurt than upset that no one has reached out to me, seeing that I was becoming a loyal customer (so I thought). Before I decided to visit this salon, I read all the not so satisfying reviews here on yelp, but it didnt deter me from trying out the salon. \u00a0I figured everyone experience is different and I needed to see for myself. \u00a0I was very pleased with their services, but not so much with their customer service skills now. \u00a0Acknowledging the problem and being willing to resolve it, is what I would have appreciated. Despite my current feelings, I still think that the ladies at this salon are talented. The biggest issue I have is them STANDING BEHIND THEIR WORK. \u00a0Anything that you specialize in and are confident about you should be able to guarantee.

I can't always find unsliced whole grain bread, but that may be my fault for tending to shop late in the day. My guess is that they ship everything in daily, rather than having some items finish-baked on site like some stores.Deli is your standard Boar's Head slice-o-mat. If you want grab-and-eat, you can get a better sandwich a few blocks away at Jimmy John's or Potbelly for about the same price.Fish selection is minimal and shrinkwrapped, which is the biggest drawback for me.

Sweetthangs Bakery by far EXCEEDED my expectations in a cheesecake. Lets be honest you don't get cheesecake because its healthy for you. This is the criteria in which I judge my cheesecake: decadence, richness, creaminess,sweetness and most of all important the crust. They hit the nail on the head satisfying all of my tastebuds and sending them into a frenzy at the same dam time. and I loved it!!!! The ordering was easy I placed my order the turnaround time was a day, I paid and had my cheesecake. Simple. The have exceptionally stellar customer service. Its a in house bakery and all the orders are custom. \u00a0The minute these guys get into a retail facility they will be a extreme force to be reckoned with within the baking community. If I could I would give these guys 20 stars. The holidays are around the corner.

I mean... day...) and cheesy \"truly outrageous\" storylines. I couldn't help myself. She went home with me along with some quirky Farrah Fawcett and 60's kitsch Batgirl refrigerator magnets. I outspent my boyfriend... again... and he made fun of me. Looks like Jem is gonna beatdown G.I. Joe, Mr, T and Luke Skywalker tonight!
