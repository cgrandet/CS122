My mom is the sweetest woman in all the land. Truly. Just right down the middle, she's the best. So naturally, she does nice things for me on her birthday...being that I am her favorite oldest daughter. (and only daughter, but pay no mind). She actually did some research on Yelp, came up with Sweet Miss Givings...and ordered a dozen (yeah, luckily I have some people to share with, or I'd have a cupcake gut for my 27th year of life.), and had them delivered to my abode on the day of my birth. And then, someone stole them. Yes, some cupcake thief STOLE MY MOTHERF'in cupcakes that my sweet mother sent me for my birthday right out of the lobby. So, as Sharon (my mom) called me several times throughout the day expecting \"yeeeeeeeeeeee!\" and \"thank youuuuuuuuuuuu!\" she was met with idle chit chat, like a normal day. So finally, by the end she just told me she had sent them, and we figured out that the infamous package stealer had preyed upon my box of goodies. (it's a chronic problem in my building, bastard). As she'd been in touch with SMG, she let them know the super depressing dealio. Then I got a call from their business manager.Him: Hi! Your cupcakes got stolen? Me: (sad face) yes. Him: Why don't you come in for a bakery tour, and we'll unveil our holiday menu to you? Me: (ears perk up), oooooo, ok!So, this past week I stopped in with my Little Sister (yelp.com/biz/big-brother\u2026) for a bakery tour. AND, we got to try the most marvelous punkin cheesecake (seriously) AND some stellar Molasses cookies, with real ginger, and um....REAL superiority.

Yeah, you've gotten away with some other random stuff of mine, but cupcakes from my mother? Your klepto-ass is going down.

Many of us Yelpers are smitten with our favorite dens of sugary bliss, and covet their delectables until we're frothing with frosting. And some of us have had enough of the craze, to whom I say, \"How can you be serious?\"Boutique cupcakes are beautiful baubles to be sure. But I've found a bakery that doesn't just satiate sugar cravings. Rather, Sweet Miss Giving's gives back to the community. . . in a major way.SWG is a bakery and jobs program that donates 50 percent of its profits to the formerly homeless and HIV/AIDS-affected men, women and children of Chicago House. In its five-year existence, more than 250 participants have benefited from the job training and placement services. SWG teaches employable skills in baking, packaging, customer service and delivery, all under the tutelage of master bakers. Cupcakes just got so much sweeter. My first experience with SWG couldn't have been better. They don't have a store front, rather any of their yum yums are delivered right to your door. That's right. You can eat cupcakes in your pajamas. Fresh cupcakes. Without lifting a finger. To quote Jim Gaffigan, \"I guess I'm not showering today.\"I chose to pick a dozen minis up for a recent trip to Michigan. I fumbled with the directions and wound up going in the wrong entrance which turned out to be a saccharine surprise, as I got escorted through the high-tech, stainless steel kitchen where bakers and students alike were hard at work on all sorts of concoctions: praline brownies, banana cream pie muffins, gingered pear scones.Yeah, it ain't just cupcakes. Understanding Chicago's collective cupcake mania shows no signs of slowing down, I implore to give into your cravings. . . and give back. Now you can. No excuses. Just do it.TIP: Don't just stop by. . . to my knowledge, there's no ready-to-eat treats. You have to pre-order through the Web site, and I'm going to try delivery next time.

The person after me got catfish. I asked him if it was good and he said that everyone he knows loves it. I added 3/4 pound of that to my order and asked him to throw in two Goose Island sauces ($1 each) for the heck of it.I stood around for long, long, long minutes. I texted M, \"I'm getting us dinner now. :-) get excited!\" I watched people order and pick up their food. I noticed that they all paid with cash. I wondered if it was a cash only place? I wouldn't put it past a hole in the wall joint to be a cash only place. Then again, there weren't any signs ANYWHERE that indicated such. Besides, cash only places usually have an ATM and this place only had those two arcade games. I walked to the opposite side of the room to see if I could possibly see the kitchen. I couldn't.Then they brought my order to the counter and I timidly started to hand over my debit card. Cash only. I asked where I could get cash. He said at the gas station over the bridge and to the left. Scrap that idea! I drove a half mile to a free ATM (free for me, at least) inside of K-Mart and then drove back. I paid $20.27. I got my food and brought it to M's.Up until this point, I believe that I would have given this place four or five stars if the food was nearly as amazing as what was described to me. But HECK NO. Both the shrimp and the catfish were both breaded and were indistinguishable from one another by a quick once over. The shrimp still had the shells on the ends and the catfish had bones in it. M called it a day after only a few bites but I wanted to power through.The breading was pretty thick and heavy. I think it might have been made with cornmeal. It had good flavor, but was too much. Eventually I started dissecting it by removing the breading to expose the shells and bones so that I could remove them before they poked my tongue and crunched in my teeth. M watched me sympathetically. She offered to make something else for me and tried her hardest to get me to give up on it.All I can say now is that those people who recommended Goose Island Shrimp House to me must have different tastes that me. I wonder if they knew that shells were on the shrimp or that bones were in the catfish?

She applied for a tourist visa with her husband but they refused to let him travel with her because they feared they wouldn't return.The Berlin Wall was still up in 1988 and times were tough. If you complained about meat being overcooked, my grandpa, who fought in WWII would say, \"It's tougher where there isn't any!\" Well, as a satellite state of the Soviet Union, there really wasn't jack shit in the GDR. They were supposedly a Demokratische Republik but communism had them in an iron curtain chokehold.It was abundantly apparent how cut off they were from the rest of the civilized world if you took a tour of their grocery stores. Shortages of what we'd consider easily accessible goods were the norm and there was little to no variety because of the government's refusal to import. After standing in long lines, you pretty much had to take what you could get, and that was assuming there was anything left to be given.While my cousin was in town, my aunt showed her around. A regular grocery store wasn't on the list of American attractions to familiarize her with, but it's one place they happened to stop and she wept when she saw all the choices. My mom joked it was a good thing she hadn't taken her to Byerly's because she probably would have completely lost it in an upscale supermarket that boasts live lobsters and carpeted floors.I'm here to say that it's a far better thing we didn't have an \"in\" with Restaurant Depot / Jetro Cash & Carry at the time because Jutta most definitely would have had a \"Moscow on the Hudson\" style breakdown of epic proportions (myspace.com/youremembert\u2026).Granted, there might not be as many brands as you'd find in conventional shops, but just about everything is sold in bulk and the place is packed with row after row of top to bottom shelving stocked with candies, canned goods, whole animals, jugs of cooking oils and spices, giant containers of condiments, and perhaps the epitome of capitalism, Coca-Cola by the case. This is pretty much where savvy restaurateurs in the Chicagoland area come to get almost all of their cooking needs met.This is a giant wholesale warehouse and you can only get in if you're associated with the restaurant/catering/foodservice industry and have their membership card. It's meant to be a place away from the public eye where owners and employees can come to purchase items they use in their places of business. \u00a0It puts Sam's Club and Costco to shame in the food department. Tell me where else you can get a dressed lamb for $80 or a laundry hamper sized bag of green peppers for a couple bucks. My most memorable purchase was a 10lb slab of beef Ribeye for about $40.By no stretch of the imagination is this store pretty, but it is practical. Items are relatively easy to locate, but the checkout line can be a hassle. The cashiers ring everything up and often times there's some type of pricing error that needs to be fixed and/or they make you wait for a security person to count out the items individually. The time it takes is annoying mostly because many of the products are perishable and waiting around in line doesn't do them any good.

They give two whole chicken legs, which is rare to be seen..most places will give only one leg that skimps out on the meat, and it's also served with fresh naan and the raita mentioned above and a side of salad. All that for only 10 bucks. It's neat how they have a different menu each day with some of the more popular items available everyday. I've been there twice and saw chicken biryani and the tikka available but saw different items I could order each time. They have specials for each day as well. The second time I went, I took my friend along with me. He loves to munch down on food even though he may not have the most eclectic appetite. Quantity is always an issue for him, however I can say that Flaming Wok 'n Grill surely filled him up. We took two appetizers -- two samosas and an order of pakora, and for the main course we had two naans with one order of chicken tikka and one order of chicken biryani (it was a little dry) but delicious nonetheless, and of course it came with raita and salad. All of this cost about 27 dollars. It was well worth our money and time. The restaurant may look shady from the exterior and the seating or decoration isn't too great inside. It is however open 365 24/7 and you'll see a lot of taxi cabs standing outside all the time. But please do step inside to have their food because it'll be a shame if you don't give it a try. Sure you can go to Devon to have Indian-Pakistani foods but there you won't get the friendly, one-to-one easy-going, homely vibe from their owners and/or staff there. The manager of the restaurant came to my table personally and was very polite and asked if we needed anything and told us to let him know if we had any questions.

I really love butter chicken, and want something similar, and 2. not too spicy, were not fulfilled. \u00a0Plus the free extras were just two pita pieces of bread, an odd assortment of veggies as if for a sandwich, and a tiny container of green sauce. \u00a0My boyfriend and I poked at the veggies for a few moments, in confusion, like \"what the heck is this for?\", it didn't stand alone, and it didn't seem to go with either the chicken in tomato or the chicken and rice dish.I think the owner knew he didn't provide his best foods, which is what I was expecting when I let him pick for me, because when I told him I'd leave a Yelp review, he hollered out the car that next time it would be better or something like that.I don't know if I am going to risk more money seeing if that is the case, though. \u00a0I was pretty disappointed with my midnight Indian food fix. \u00a0My boyfriend ate a little bit of the chicken and rice dish, but I could tell he was wondering what the heck I was thinking when I ordered from here. \u00a0He absolutely refused to even try the chicken in tomato sauce dish that had come super cold. \u00a0(When I say tomato sauce, I do NOT mean delectable creamy tomato curry sauce, just plain, jane tomato sauce. \u00a0Or stew.) \u00a0Maybe another late midnight evening I will give them another chance, but only if they have butter chicken on the menu.Reading some of the other reviews on here, I don't know if they offer everything on their menu all of the time, so they might need to be more clear on that concept... which isn't a bad concept if it is understood correctly!", "rating": "2", "date": [2010, 11, 14]}, "48": {"description": "The smells lured me in.

I went from around 3-4AM on a Sunday morning to see the place pleasantly packed. Yes, there is no menu on display, but as my roommate and I looked lost, the owner beckoned us over to the counter. Yes he showed us the area where the food sat out, warming and did ask if we've had Indian food before (more polite than not, if you ask me - how's he to know?). He pointed out what was what, and suggested a few. We didn't know how much anything would cost, but I'm sure if you asked he wouldn't have lied. If you didn't care to ask, I don't see anyone getting indignant over $7-8 food that comes in heaping portions. The naan is indeed amazing, and whatever two things we pointed to were also delicious. At the end of our meal he asked if we wanted some salad, brought it over, and told us he'd be right back with something he thought we'd like. This was after he'd brought us our check. He returned with what the place calls \"Frontier Chicken\" that, despite our stuffed bellies, was really great. I told my friend that all the chicken in our dishes was probably the most tender and moist for its price that I had ever had. Really - everything has been cooking for so long it falls right off the bone.The man actually also served us himself, telling us to sit down when I got up to get some glasses of water.What I really loved about the place: The fact that the sort of uncomfortable smell of spices and maybe even a little grime just hits you in the face as you walk in. The place was crowded with people you could tell visited the place often. Why? most of the patrons reached over the counter with their plates and served themselves. The table next to me was full of four men eating with their hands (how it's done in the motherland) - always amazes me how well they can clean up their plates! A man next to us told us he hadn't seen us around before, and then urged us to take a delivery menu home with us.So, you may have to serve yourself with your own utensils, napkins, and water glasses (who hasn't done that before).

You could imagine my dismay when I lacked my order, 1.5 hours after I ordered it.So I called the store, and the person on the other end only seemed vaguely aware of my order. He told me that he'd have to switch out the chicken puffs for samosas in order to save time - I was okay with this. 10 minutes later the driver calls asking me for directions, apparently google maps isn't standard issue for the delivery industry these days.The driver leaves the food in THE LOBBY, we were only informed by our nice doorman. We open the packages, only to find that they stiffed us on our replacement samosas, they FORGOT THE NAANS, and our food was cold and stale. Overall my experience was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

Sometimes they will call us to say \"we are out of butter chicken. we are sending you frontier instead\". but sometimes, they dont even tell us and change the order!! I find this so odd that I don't even know what to say. Yesterday, instead of 3 orders of pakodas, we received 3 samosas. When I asked the person he said \"oh if we run out, we send samosas\". First, I would have ordered samosas if that is what I wanted and 2nd, how about freakin letting your customer know that you are sending something different?

The day's curries and food are placed in metal trays behind the counter and customers peek over to see what they have that day and place their orders. The lady then scoops them onto a plate (or box, for take out). For those who complained about \"food already sitting out\" on the counter, well, this is how it's done in many parts of Asia and even in Turkey. It's a very common concept where vendors or restaurants cook pot loads of dishes and put them in metal trays for customers to pick what they'd like to have for their meal.
