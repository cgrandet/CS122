Though I do not care much for thighs, it was missing the thigh.I went back to inform them that I did not get 4 pieces as should be with a halfchicken slate & the door was locked because it had closed. \u00a0So I took themeal I had not eaten at that point & myreceipt to the bakery in front or next door that seemed to be open late if not24 hours. \u00a0The cashier there was puzzled and could not help me thoughshe did start to give me the phone number for Uncle John's but then I realizedI had the \u00a0receipt in my hand w/ the phone number on it.I went back to my car to call Uncle John's several times as it was only about12:02 AM Thursday, June 5th & I thought someone would answer the phones asthey were closing. I called may be 3 times & no one answered & therewas no voicemail to accept any messages.I thought there was nothing more I could do so I acquiesced & proceededto just eat the meal since I could not save it until the morning to dispute & I hada major project to work on Thursday and no time to go back anyway.About another 10 minutes after that, I saw one of the cooks or the personwho took my money approaching her vehicle. \u00a0So I asked her whyI was not given a half chicken with 4 pieces as I only got 3 pieces asthe thigh was missing. \u00a0She argued with me saying I was wrong and thatthe chicken is cut in half and yadda yadda... She could not understandfor herself how the chicken could have been cut so in half that it wouldnot have the thigh piece as maybe the chicken could have beendefective? \u00a0She was very insulting toa customer who paid and said to some other male there that I had too muchdrama or something to that effect. \u00a0I asked her before that could I talk to her management and she saidshe was the manager ...

Don't get me wrong - in the abstract, I might give this place 4 stars had I never visited their old location. Unfortunately, I have. The new location makes gives me new respect for what the old location achieved despite its own limitations - just like the 2011 remake of 'Conan the Barbarian' gave me new respect for the original, despite the original being what film critic Vincent Canby described as 'a long, incoherent, ineptly staged adventure-fantasy'. [RIP Vince.]My main issues include:1) Prices have increased - and there is no longer a Monday/Tuesday special. While I imagine the new place may have slightly higher rent, it's farther for anyone who doesn't live on the far south side and the traffic much worse on local roads since there is no easy access off the highway. So it's more expensive in cash and your time.2) Despite increased prices, the food quality is less consistent. You'd think with the larger kitchen, that shouldn't be the case. You'd also think with higher prices that shouldn't be the case. You'd be wrong on both counts. Never had an issue at the old spot even during the Monday / Tuesday specials.3) The 'sauce on the side' charge. I'm beginning to think that they drench the ribs / fries in sauce to mask ribs/fries that have been done long enough to begin to dry out. By requesting the ribs without sauce, they are forced to give you the fresher ribs, so they want to discourage that by adding a charge. Here's the thing - bbq sauce costs about as much as ketchup. Would anyone accept paying extra for ketchup just to be able to avoid a hot dog or fries that are past their prime? I guess the new Uncle John's management hopes so.That being said I still like the ribs. I just didn't like them nearly as much as I feel I should given the increased cost and inconvenience.

Nowmy order was a total of $109.00 this young man brings out 2 items when Iordered about 7 or 8. I ask him is this all you having out of my entire order?he says yes this is all they can locate in the store, imagine my confusion. Itell him I thought that was the reason Walmart asks you to choose a location sothey can ensure the items are here? he reply and says that is\"walmart.com\" not walmart ( as he stands in front of a walmart.comsign). I truly did not want to argue I ask him if he can cancel my complete order.he says yes. I personally grab a cart and go through the ales and find everyitem I ordered online to begin with...... Imagine how upset I am I go to theregister and re purchase all items for $146.00, I left the store with other badcustomer service at the register and at the door checking my receipt.. I getonline to walmart.com the next day just to double check everything wascanceled, I go to my cart and see that there is still 3 items shipping to thestore huh?????? I log on and chat with a representative whom I gave the abovestory to who felt really bad. His words to me were \"WE FAILED YOU\" heensured me that he will escalate my refund. I let things go for a few days goback online the orders are still in my cart ( at this point I am on fire)because I still have a total of $246.00 holding on my debit card in Walmartcharges... I get back on the chat and explain myself again she tells me thatnothing has been escalated smh and that I have 2 options 1. I can go back tothe store to cancel the items or 2. wait 7 days if the items are not picked upthey are automatically canceled?????? I instantly asked her for the number tocorporate which she claims she does not have. She states if I call walmart.comthey will transfer me. I call walmart.com and asked to speak to corporate theytransferred me and I was on hold for about 30 min. I grab my house phone andcall walmart.com and speak to a supervisor named \" Samantha\", I explainedto her my detailed situation and she calls \"Theresa\" at 83rd andstewart location on 3 way and they both decide the only way still that they cancancel the items that should have already be canceled is for me to go all theway back to the store?? I literally just disconnected the phone call becausethis is more time wasted. I go to the location to cancel my items again anotherunnecessary mistake. Their were 2 gentleman at the counter whom tried to tellme they couldn't cancel them from here (I had to remind them that I was givenno choice) after switching registers and gaining the help of another lady thecanceled the rest of my order. No no that's not it lol. Today Is Feb, 1st so asI had some free time I go back onto walmart.com to make sure everything iscanceled again. Imagine my surprise when everything says canceled but I stillsee a balance of 19.78??? I have to call walmart.com again because this isunclear I speak to a pleasant gentleman by the name of \"Victor\" whomtried his hardest to help but really couldn't figure it out either and againstates he will escalate my matter to refund me this difference now ( if youhave read my entire review you will know why I am not confident this willhappen). This has been going on for about a week now and I am still missingmoney from this order, I am calling out walmart corporate to make it right withme which I know may not happen because apparently service is not a priority atthis company. Honestly this experience makes me want to NEVER shop at walmartagain. I hope this helps at least one person... walmart if you get a chance to read this look up my order and contactme.

I visited a Walmart location a few days ago and used a self checkout kiosk. I mistakenly asked for cash back from the kiosk (which does not dispense cash) and left the store without realizing I never received my change. \u00a0I called in to customer service, and was advised over the phone by one customer service associate (Ronidqua) to bring in my receipt to receive the cash back from my transaction. I came into the store, and waited 45-minutes in line to get assistance. Once at the customer service counter, I explained my situation, to which the associate, Candice, takes my receipt and tells me to have a seat because my issue will take a while. \u00a0After 20-minutes of waiting, I follow up with Candice to make sure someone is handling my issue. \u00a0She says that she just followed up with someone about my issue and walks off to handle returned items. After ANOTHER 45-minutes of waiting patiently, I ask to speak to a manager (Rolando). After explaining my issue to him, he tells me that I should first contact my banking institution to handle this matter and if they can't do anything, then to come back to the store. \u00a0I ask him if it would be possible to at least get my original receipt back, to which he responds no member of his staff would have taken a receipt and given it to a member of security to rectify an issue. \u00a0He then proceeds to tell me that if my financial institution is unable to resolve the issue, then I should come back and they can re-print me a copy of my receipt. \u00a0He made ZERO attempt to recover my original receipt or even acknowledge the fact that one of his associates DID execute such an act. \u00a0After multiple requests to get my original receipt returned to me, I asked if he could get the associate that took my receipt from me. He responded that she had left for the evening. \u00a0The level of complete and utter lack of adequate customer service at this location is very disturbing. There have been several instances with similar outcomes where I leave highly frustrated at the lack of care associates take in fulfilling even their basic responsibilities. There is obviously a lack of training present, both in basic customer service and in problem solving. Instances like these make it increasingly daunting to patron these locations because of the EXPECTATION of poor customer service and lack of care by almost ALL employed associates. \u00a0This type of quality is not indicative of the Walmart mission or vision and needs to be addressed immediately. \u00a0No one should ever be subjected to the blatant disregard for people or their time that I experienced.This was the final straw for me spending my money with a company that could clearly care less about quality customer satisfaction or even basic customer service. \u00a0I will no longer shop here and fully intend to spread the word about the poor service I received today.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 2, 22]}, "23": {"description": "If I could, I would give this location 0 stars.

I went to purchase a TV and was looking for a 32 inch. I wanted a 32 inch Samsung. I saw a 32 inch at Walmart but it was high. I went to Target, got a 40 inch Samsung Television for a cheaper price than the Walmart 32 inch television. Walmart was once the store I loved to come to, however these days it is getting worse. The women's clothing department looks like an Elderly person is the buyer. Nothing that makes a mature woman want to wear it because it is no style but a bunch of colors. You can find elastic waist pants all day. Other than that nothing jumps out.In addition, get some pizza's in there that are not pepperoni and sausage.

The entire thing is covered so, rain or shine, you can enjoy not matter the weather but the sides/windows are open-air so you don't feel like you're trapped inside. There are a bunch of tables and also a decent amount of room to stand (if you so choose). We had a table in the corner, which was nice as it kept us out of a traffic area. Everything there is relatively clean as well... well, except for a VERY LARGE spider that decided to try and spin a web right above our heads... luckily we took him out without issue.Staff: Our waiter was just ok... He was rather attentive although there were a few mishaps. He wasn't the most speedy and, even delivering drinks, didn't have the most steady of a hand (he ended up spilling a beer down my leg). But, no major harm. And he did give us a round of free shots for taking care of, and not completely freaking out about, the spider.Drinks/Food: We were there for happy hour so we only had drinks. But they were tasty and served nice and cold. After everyone else left, I stayed to give their wings a try. I went with 20 of them, half Buffalo and half \"friggin' hot!\" I must say that I really enjoyed the buffalo but did not feel the same about the \"FH\" flavor. The buffalo was classic with a \u00a0little bit of heat. The FH was not as flavorful and really not that much hotter than the buffalo. Rather disappointing. However, the wings themselves were very good and are rather good-sized.Value: The drinks prices, for happy hour, are a solid deal and the food is not outrageously priced.I really liked this rooftop and cannot wait to return in the future!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 8, 31]}, "59": {"description": "I can't say enough good things about Plymouth--the food is excellent, the service is fast, and the drink specials are phenomenal.First, the food.

Beyond all this, the waffle fries are excellent. Also, on Fridays they have a $3 fish taco special where you get a huge serving of delicious fish tacos for only $3!! Can't be beat!Next, the drinks. Plymouth has a $5 martini special every night of the week! I especially love the pomegranate martinis on Fridays! The martinis are delicious and everyone I've taken here has been impressed by them. Your best bet is to get the fish taco special & the martini special.

After reading reviews of all the colonic treatment centers in the city of Chicago or close by, I chose this one. I was received by Kimberley. At first I was very nervous because Kimberley was very \"in my face\" and excited about meeting me and bringing me into the room. I'm not sure it was her personality or just my own nervousness about sharing this personal experience with her, who i didn't know at all. Once I got myself set up, invited her back in to help with the process, and we began the flow of water into my rectum, I just decided to relax and let it be. Then I felt more comfortable with her, and maybe she relaxed too, seeing I had relaxed. She was very sensitive to how personal and intimate the experience was for me, verbally and in body language. She was supportive and also knew when to leave the room and give me my space. I had waves of nausea coming and going, and once I got the hang of the occasional intensity, I could look over at the tube to my side with all the stuff coming out of my body from the flush. I felt I was actually learning spiritual lessons of sticking through something scary with myself. As the most intense waves of nausea rushed at me, I worked to keep my heart open and be present, rather than squirm and try to resist the unpleasant feelings. And every time I released the water - what a relief! At the end of the treatment I paid (a very fair price by the way) and took the probiotics they offer freely after the treatment. Walking to the train to ride home (it was evening), I immediately noticed my groundedness and centeredness and sense of peace within. i genuinely felt different, with all these toxins having been removed. I felt AMAZING!! This was last night. I am still feeling quite cleansed. Also, i think I released a lot my first time (bile and solids and who knows what else) because I am currently on a week long liver/gallbladder cleansing diet which basically consists of simple, unprocessed foods, without fried food, excess sugar, or animal products.

This experience has motivated me to live a healthier life. I can't wait to go back Saturday for my second cleanse. Edita stated the first cleanse normally doesn't release a lot of toxins, it isn't until your second cleanse where you start to see some real release. But for my first session I released a lot of toxins and she said I did very well for my first time.A little about the details, I did a closed system, which basically means the hydrotherapist is in the room with you the entire time. Open system you perform the colonic yourself. Edita talked to me the whole time and she also massaged my stomach to help the flow of water through my colon.There is slight discomfort because you have the feeling of wanting to poo when she fills your colon with water, but this is a good thing because the warm water is flowing through your colon and breaking up all those years of toxins building up in the pockets of your colon. You get to see the stuff come out of you in that machine on the wall. It's kind of gross but it's a lesson to learn what stuff we hold in our bodies and possibly could motivate you to eat healthier foods.After 30 mins I couldn't take it anymore and needed to go to the toilet and handle business if you know what I mean.

I know this is gross but for those who want to know I am letting you know, when you get on that toilet you are letting out whatever water that was left in your colon including the other crap your colon has. After you are done releasing, you put your undies and pants back on and go speak with the hydrotherapist. She gave me a probiotic and also suggested I eat light for the rest of the day. Something like soup or a light salad. Since my colon has been cleaned I want to NOT eat any rich or heavy foods.I would highly recommend this facility for a comfortable experience and a great feeling afterwards :-)", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 11, 4]}, "13": {"description": "Kimberly at Chicago Internal Cleansing was fantastic!! For my first session, I signed up for the \"assisted cleanse\" and Kimberly was with me from the second I walked into the clinic to the minute I left. She completely calmed my nerves (I was pretty terrified about doing this), and made me feel totally comfortable. After my first session, I spent about 30 minutes on the toilet- I released more waste than I could of ever imagined I would! I went back for my second session yesterday and did the Libbe system. It's a machine that you lay down on and it's less assisted- you basically do everything on your own, but Kimberly explained how to work the machine and came in to check on me throughout the treatment to make sure I was A-Okay. Also, there is a doorbell on the machine that you can ring if anything is wrong and she will come right in and help you. It's definitely a process- I am doing 5 sessions to break up all the gunk in my system that has accumulated over the last 27 years, but I'm happy to report that I can already see a huge difference after only 2 sessions.

Here goes! Or in this case, \"there it goes\"... Going to a new colonics place is always, for me, a bit worrisome. Usually the procedure is only mildly uncomfortable during the initial... ...ummmm.... ...shall I just say the \"beginning\", although I once had one that reminded me to avoid prison at all costs. Not here! Chicago Internal Cleansing, or \"C.I.C.\" is one of the finer medical spas in the city. It is not thankfully, a new-agey place where you hold crystals and chant, and listen to plinky-plinky music while your butt is hosed out. Thankfully there is no \"hard sell\" of various products or other services. (That's for you, Ruby Room!)Located on the fourth floor of the north end of the Carbide Building that also houses the Hard Rock Hotel \u00a0 \u00a0(insert irony here) \u00a0 \u00a0the offices are soothing and most importantly, immaculate. CIC offers both the closed and the open system of internal cleansing, along with an oxygen sauna thingy that I am not too familiar with. Frankly, I have not had a colonic using the \"open system\" because it sounded too scary, but after seeing the actual device and hearing the explanation of how it works, I'd give it a try next time. So, yeah, I try to do this whenever I am in town. Ideally, a series of them. Conveniently, CIC offers a package where you get a discount. Five for $360. Money well spent, and after four I still have one in the well. The equipment is state of the art, and anything that you come in contact with is disposable and \"single use\" only. Both ladies that work there, Edita and Kimberly, are professional, GENTLE, and both literally radiate good heath. I've seen this healthy glow before in other colon hydrotherapists. You don't need to convince me that removing the toxins that build up in your ass has a lot to do with that look. It may have something to do with your liver super-purifying itself once your colon is completely empty, as opposed to a slower release of the nasties your liver is supposed to get rid off. (I suppose its like flushing your radiator or something.) Disclaimer; The following part of this review may not be suitable for younger audiences. Still here?-OK.!Colonic #1 with Edita. Punctual. The \"delicate\" part of the procedure was fast and painless. The results were good, but I knew that we were only scratching the surface. Colonic #2 with Edita. Three days later. I know for a fact that I did NOT eat that much in the last few days. Where is this shit coming from? Colonic #3 with Edita. An obvious change in what floats through the glass tube. During the fill and massage, I actually felt something inside me spasm (not painfully, just surprisingly) and the result was pretty impressive. But in my heart, or in my colon perhaps, I knew that there was something else lurking in there. And whatever it was, perhaps the gum I swallowed in grade school, or my sister's Barbie doll's head from 40 years ago, was becoming aware of it's inevitable fate. But it was stubborn. It was evil. The demon refused to leave. Colonic #4 with Kimberly. If there is such a thing as the \"break through colonic\", this was it. I almost wanted to shout \"THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!!!!\" as what appeared to be a combination as asphalt and old bicycle tires blasted out of my system.Kim told me that this had been in there for a very, very long time.I have no idea what that was, but I am sure glad it is GONE!

That was a month ago. I wish I could say that one session and I was cured, but that's not the way my condition works. I felt great afterward, but eventually, the symptoms reappear.

All in all, this place is not as upscale as some others in the city. But it is clean and quiet and feels very cozy. They do not offer a great many services, just hydrotheapy and oxygen sauna (which I mean to try). They also do not try to up sell a bunch of supplements or services that you don't need.

It was sort of grayish in color. After inspecting several fillets, I could not find one flake of fish. It was really disgusting.

So it was recommended that I start going for massages at least once a month. I learned of Kimm and Infinite Touch from Groupon. The location was not too far from where I live in Hyde Park and I knew that parking would not be too difficult unlike if the location was downtown or on the North side. I really liked the fact that I was able to schedule my appointment online. It was extremely easy and convenient and I immediately received confirmation via email. Two days later, I received a confirmation call from Kimm. If you are looking for a very high end, frou-frou spa experience, then Infinite Touch is not for you. I am from the south side of Chicago, so I was not phased by the location on 79th St. If you're nervous about venturing into the south side (let's be honest, some people are) don't worry, Infinite Touch is located just a few blocks off the the expressway- it is very easy to get to (although you can easily miss it as there is not a sign that says \"Infinite Touch\" rather just the business logo) and there is ample street parking. I was immediately greeted by the receptionist upon entering. He took my coat and offered me something to drink. Again, it's a no-frills place however it was clean and modestly decorated. The new age music that was playing was a nice, relaxing touch. \u00a0By no means am I a massage therapy connoisseur, however I can't imagine a massage being any better than Kimm's. Kimm seemed to instinctively know where my trouble spots were without me even going into much detail other than a few questions answered on the first time client questionnaire. I have experienced less than stellar service from companies once they found out I was patronizing their establishment because of a Groupon deal. However, that was not the case at all with Kimm. I did not feel rushed or short changed in the least bit. Matter of fact, once my massage was over, Kimm went the extra mile by giving me a cupcake and mini bottle of champagne for my birthday which was that day! I highly recommend Kimm based on the actual massage and customer service.

I tried on pair after pair in the men's section but didn't find anything that worked. I did however find a pair of 2013 Hyperdunks in my size on super sale! I like the fit of the 2013s better than the 2014s and wasn't pressed enough to wait and see what the 2015s look like. They were on clearance at a cheap price already plus I got another 20% off! Moving on to the women's section, I really hoped I could find my workout shoes because those were my immediate need. Again, I tried on shoe after shoe and in what seemed like the last row I finally found them. There were also on sale... not clearance... but still, half the price I had expected to pay. For my basketball and workout shoes combined, I paid less than I expected for just one pair. I didn't come here looking for this exact shoe in this exact color... I would assume it would be much harder to shop here if that were the case, but if you're looking for a deal on great pair of Nikes I'd definitely check it out.

Lauren?\" Like I didn't just get off the phone with her or she wasn't referring to herself.

After she blow dry my hair she asked another stylist (Shaynah) to braid and prep me for a sew-in.

The meeting was well over an hour. I was ready to get up and walk out of the salon. Which now, I regret that I did not do it. Lauren does okay hair but she did my sew-in too tight.

Well I haven't been to a shop where everyone in their can do hair and do it very well when you come out the chair looking like a natural star I looooove getting sew ins here, as for the other reviews I never received any bad service here but my advice for any complaints of a business is to let the person who is doing your hair know she is doing something that you don't like and if that don't work let the manager know nicely. But I love my hair it's soft bouncy and natural looking people kept asking me how I grew my hair that long I said Bobbi boss remi! Deja vu always have my hair looking fly!!! Now a few lessons in salon etiquette:1. Make an appointment, remember who you spoke to when you made the appointment and show up. If you can't make the appointment or you are going to be late give the stylist the courtesy of a phone call at least a day before or 2 hrs before you know u aren't coming or goof to be late. The stylist is taking her time out to wait a provide a service for u respect the stylist.2. Tipping- tip your stylist and shampoo girl why the shampoo girl because she made your hair feel good massaging the shampoo into your scalp, taking down the braids and extensions come on show your appreciation and tip. Tip your stylist because she did a nice ass job your not cheap with other things so why be cheap with your hair?3. Come in with an idea or picture of how you want your hair, stylist are artist but not mind readers!!! Before the stylist cut make sure that's what you want if something hurts or is too tight let them know, advice with extensions if your used to a brand you like get it but if you don't know about extensions or want to try something new call the stylist before your appointment because the quality of hair is important in achieving a beautiful style if you need to know where to get good hair online message me.Other then that I had my hair done by toccara the owner and Tara they are cold in what they do check them out cause they do it all 4 real!", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 4, 17]}, "4": {"description": "I only go here if I am ass out..

The woman then took the time to walk down to the aisle the brand was located and inspect the shelves until she found the product I was looking for. Woohoo!

Still over salty.And then the biggest disappointed ever - the mac and cheese! Texture was still great.. flavor would liokely have been great too if it weren't for the fact that it, too, was soooooooo salty! I ended up rinsing (gross, I know) my mac n cheese, as well, in hopes that I could save it. Nope :( \u00a0Ate around it some, but ultimately threw it out as well because much too salty.My siste r- who loves salt and has a much higher tolerance than me - even said it was way too salty.

This restaurant chain is also an award winning franchise. My only reason for the three stars is the fact that they only accept cash payments and no credit or debit cards. They do need to get in touch with technology as to how things are paid for since not everyone carries a lot of cash on them. It's easier for them to use a debit or credit card to pay for things instead of having to hunt down an ATM. They would be better off if they accepted credit cards as a form of payment. Im also not impressed with the excessive panhandling that seems to be the norm around the neighborhood and having customers getting harassed by homeless people and general idiots begging for change. Overall the food is very delicious and be sure to ask for NO MSG because many people have food allergies and that stuff can really mess up your sinuses if you're not careful and have an allergy to certain seasonings. The restaurant can be a little cleaner and maybe invest in a bug zapper to handle all the flies that congregate inside the restaurant. I know it gets warm during the summer but something has to give with the flies being all over the place. It's better to do a call in and pick \u00a0up and not really eating there to save yourself from being harassed by bums and hoodies.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 8, 12]}, "0": {"description": "Delivery was great, Orange chicken was nasty and the customer service is horrible, I would never go here again", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 2, 12]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Chatham"], "latitude": 41.7422714, "longitude": -87.6045914, "rating": "3.0", "times": {"Mon": ["10:00 am", "11:00 pm"], "Thu": ["10:00 am", "11:00 pm"], "Sat": ["11:00 am", "10:30 pm"], "Wed": ["10:00 am", "11:00 pm"], "Tue": ["10:00 am", "11:00 pm"], "Sun": ["11:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Fri": ["10:00 am", "11:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Chinese", "chinese"]], "address": ["8357 S Cottage Grove"], "attributes": {"Take-out": "Yes", "Has TV": "No", "Wi-Fi": "No", "Accepts Credit Cards": "No", "Noise Level": "Average", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "No", "Delivery": "Yes", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Attire": "Casual", "Waiter Service": "No", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Good for Kids": "Yes"}, "category": "Restaurants", "number_of_reviews": "4"}, "beauty-plus-chicago": {"comments": {"1": {"description": "It looks a little iffy from the outside, but the inside has everything you could need and the employees were super nice!

Of course, that diet does have consequences down the road, but we all make choices - it's just a matter of whether we feel the costs outweigh the benefits. In the case of Harold's, I would say its worth losing a few months of your life to enjoy some of their ridiculously good chicken in the present. I really think the key is in frying to order - this really makes a big difference. This Harold's itself was a nice environment and is easily accessible for those on the go. They even have a picture of Bernie Mac (RIP) with someone who I assume is the owner. I went with the 1/2 chicken dinner with hot sauce (which isn't all that hot). The mild sauce has a more bbq type taste and I like getting both because there's inevitably way more chicken than sauce with the standard order for my liking. However, I really think Harold's is the kind of meal where if you go its got to be your only meal for the day. Also, this stuff is entirely too unhealthy to be eating for more than say once a month (unless you're exercising and consuming copious amounts of vegetables \u00a0on top) because your body knows you're killing it softly with this stuff.

I should have walked but thought there had to be something to this place since there is so many of them. Nope. Ordered the 4 piece wings with mild sauce. For whatever meat was on those wings, which I'm still debating if there was any, was \u00a0greasy and flavorless. I was like eating dirty grease. And the \"mild sauce\".....that was simply ketchup. Even the fries were terrible. I felt nauseous the whole trip home and immediately had to shower when I did get home to get that smell off. I was thankful however for the two pieces of bread put in the bottom of the tray....without, I would have had that grease all over my car.
