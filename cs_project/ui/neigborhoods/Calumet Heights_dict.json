Seriously, I mean. . . c'mon, son!-My mac &cheese: Velveeta/American cheese-ish. Noooooo! In the words of Martin Lawerence, \"Don't nobody put pasteurized cheesein macaroni and cheese. You got to use cheddar. Cheddar's what you use. My mama taught me that. ...\"-My cornbread muffin: Was absolutely delicious. :-/-My peach cobbler: Was soupy and I hate soupy peach cobbler. The peach cobbler was flooded while the greens were in a drought. As with too many people who cook soul food, basic cooking principles aren't used when making this dessert. Cooking the peaches briefly before you assemble the cobbler. Simple as that. The peaches weren't tender, still on the crisper side. I was thoroughly not pleased. -Caramel cake I got to-go: That frosting was just not right. The cake was way too dense to be a layer cake and tasted terribly buttery. That's just the food. The cushions in the bench seats were coming apart from the frame. There was't much lighting in there, even on a bright sunny day which gave such a dank atmosphere. Only one, I say one, of the people working there was friendly, helpful and welcoming. The rest just seemed unconcerned about anything that wasn't their direct task. C'mon, son!

After today I would never step foot in this establishment again.

Once I bit into them it was like chewing a potato chip. I then called to speak with the manager he wasn't there. So the person who answered asked how can I help. I began to explain he interrupted to say \"he knew so he told\" that's where I stopped him to explain let me finish. I explained I'm not looking for a refund and no I don't want any more food. So apparently I may have cursed in my explanation and he acted as if I cursed at him and began to get louder. Now I may have said a word or two I really don't recall but in no way did I direct this at him I was simply giving my discretion of the food. As well as letting him know I understand you can't pick the size of the wing and I realized they tried to put in more. But the cook should know better than to cook wings of that size the same amount of time as larger ones. When the meat on the outside is just as hard as the inside there's a problem. \u00a0So he began to talk as if I had completely cursed him out and speak I'll of him which at $18 for wings that were garbage maybe u should have been. I let him know ofcourse if i used a curse in my description and he was offended I'm sorry. But there was no need for him to say anything defensive my call was to inform them of my disappointment in what had been served.
