Las pupusas de loroco \u00a0y las de revuelta (had to bust out the Spanish here!) were perfect and not greasy at all. \u00a0Loroco is a Salvadoran flower bud that tastes kind of like spinach when cooked. Revuelta is a mixture of minced pork, beans and cheese- the trifecta of tastiness. As I said, both were excellent and reminded me a lot of how my grandma and aunts make them.In addition to the pupusas, we orderd yuca frita (fried yucca root) and sweet plantains. The yuca frita came with fried pork chunks that were killer! The only thing I would add is perhaps a side of mojo for dipping. Instead, I used the complimentary salsas and was perfectly happy. Not everyone likes to dip their yuca, I happen to be a dipper. The sweet plantains (platanos maduros) were just how I like them- lightly fried and not soaking in oil. You also get a healthy portion for the price. At the end of the night, my husband and I ate like kings and still had food left over to take home. This feast cost us the hefty price of.... $27. Yep, just $27 total for the BOTH of us for six pupusas, yuca frita, platanos, and soft drinks. You can't beat the price! Need I mention that this place is BYOB? Yes. Hell yes. So not only is the food tasty and cheap, but you can also bring your own booze which makes the deal even better. Looking over the menu I noticed they had virgin margaritas. Perhaps they will let you bring your own tequila? I know most BYOB places only allow beer and wine, but it couldn't hurt to ask next time! They also have michelada mixers- all you have to do is bring your own beer!In summary, this place is great.

When I called to make the appointment, I was offered the optional free stress assessment as well. Since it was free, I figured, why not? Even though I already felt pretty sure what my stress level was . . . like, maybe, off the charts?Anyway, the office is located just west of Pulaski on Lawrence. I found free street parking a block away on Leland, near the police station on Pulaski. There is metered parking available on the main streets, of course, but I'm a long-time Chicagoan, and that means - you don't pay to park!The office looks like a medical clinic. Which it is. It's a chiropracty office with massage. A very nice young lady was the receptionist. She did the optional stress test in a back room.The decor is pretty sparse. But frankly, I'm not Oprah's favorite designer, I want good services in a clean space, and that's what this place offers.The stress assessment consisted of blood pressure checks, while seated and while standing. Depending on the difference between the two readings, you can apparently tell if the adrenal glands are working overtime. The young lady also did an eyeball test - she briefly flashed a penlight's beam into each eye, checking to see the rate of the eyeball's contraction. Because I actually eat very healthy and exercise, I was deemed to be on the very low end of stressed.The massage was in the front room, which was pretty chilly and small. However, there was a blanket on the table, so I was not cold after disrobing or during the massage. The massage therapist, Jen, took a moment to ask me about my concerns, and what I wanted from the hour-long massage. And God love her, she actually did what I wanted. Jen's technique was excellent - thorough, good pace, and deep enough so that I really felt like I had good bodywork. She checked in with me about the pressure occasionally. And I totally zoned out - I looked at the clock in the room, before and after, and she did a full hour. But, from la-la land, where I was, it seemed like it was a lot less time. It's Einstein's example of relativity: when you sit on a hot stove, a minute seems like an hour. When you spend an hour kissing your significant other, an hour seems like a minute.Jen did take a moment to go over the Wellness Club membership for massage, and gave me a description to take home.

The bag everything came in was very neatly organized, intelligently so, order stapled to the outside. The hummus: a giant serving, came with 3 pitas complimentary. Quality of both was excellent and hummus was nicely garnished. The kibbe: a mincemeat fried thing with sauce made mostly from lamb: this was good but not amazing. Perhaps I expected more flavor. I'd probably salt it next time because the quality of the meat was good and it was delicately fried not super heavy. Came on a bed of lettuce with an interesting tahini sauce.Beef Schwarma: a healthy large cup portion with tomato based sauce and a tahini-like sauce (may have had yogurt in it). Different than the tahini for the kibbe. Quality excellent, size, excellent.The chicken kabob sandwich was the highlight of the meal. Perfectly marinated with just the right amount of sauce to make it smooth, but fresh crisp vegetables in a light pita wrap, this was like butter but with more taste contrasts and highlights.I have 2 meals left over from this and it all cost $30.

They execute all of the essential elements of a Middle Eastern feast perfectly -- especially the hummus, baba ghannouj, tabbouli, fattoush, and falafel, all of which are consistently prepared the way I'd expect on a trip back to Beirut.

Given my family background, I had high standards, but Joseph and his staff were more than up to the task and exceeded our expectations in every respect. Throughout the process, Joseph was easy to work with and available to discuss our menu planning and coordinate logistical issues with our planner and catering staff. On the day of, Joseph made sure that all of the food arrived in perfect, \"restaurant-quality\" condition - especially the lamb and chicken kebabs, which were cooked perfectly. My extended family - including some who flew in from Lebanon and have very discerning taste when it comes to Mediterranean cuisine - were uniformly impressed, which I can assure you is no small accomplishment!I would recommend Semiramis to anyone who is looking for an authentic, affordable Middle Eastern feast.

It's run by a young immigrant family. The owner is the cook and therefore always in the place, so you can count on it being consistent and attentive. His wife helps supervise and organize, and their children are helpful, buzzing around the dining room, serving water, helping translate, taking orders too, learning the business and being cute.The manager/major domo/head waiter (whom I originally thought was the owner) is a very friendly and helpful man. He is quick to suggest dishes if need be and has a good memory for returning customers (even if it's only their second visit). He is welcoming and sets a great tone for new visitors. All of the staff are eager to please and very nice. If they appear shy, it is probably due to the fact some have a limited command of English.This restaurant's environment is very basic: colorful walls and some decorations and a large TV for watching American football or other shows (with no sound so not annoying). Most important: it's clean. Very clean. Each table is already well stocked with utensils, napkins and sauces, so it's well organized too. It has an open air kitchen so you can see everything that happens in the \"back of the house\" which promotes honesty, cleanliness, and cooperation among staff. They're busy, working to make our food, and you can tell that they are doing a good job.LD Pho's menu is lengthy but not exhausting. It has plenty of appetizers, multiple variations of pho, plus many other Vietnamese dishes, and a little to my surprise, it also has a few other cuisines' dishes such as pad thai and udon noodles -- both of which are excellent. Everything I've ordered from this restaurant has come out hot, fresh, and delicious. Prices are right for the type and location of restaurant. There is also a daily specials board that changes regularly. A bonus is the fact that you can order a \"baby pho\" (like a baby cone at an ice cream store) so that if you want pho but not as your only food (because their regular sized pho is enormous like most Pho restuarants), you can pay $5 for a smaller portion. Now, let's realize that this would be a very large bowl of soup at any other style cuisine, and you realize you're getting a bargain.I would recommend this place to both the new-to-Vietnamese-cuisine eater as well as someone looking for a neighborhood spot that serves Vietnamese food. Patrons are fortunately a mix of all ethnicities including Vietnamese, so it's evident that all are welcome and that the food is appreciated by not just the newly introduced, but also those who want and know authentic Vietnamese cooking. For example my friend who is quite knowledgeable about Vietnamese cooking mentioned that this place serves bun mam (a spicy seafood soup) not often found in our Chicago Vietnamese restaurants.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 23]}, "26": {"description": "Finally made it back here after they moved from the old location.

The only thing I was iffy about was that she parted my hair to match the photo which is the opposite side to how I wear it, but that's a fairly easy home fix.It was a very Hispanic heavy salon with Telemundo on the TV and no other English speaking customers so I felt a little out of my element, but the atmosphere was friendly and the price was right for me so I might go back if my regular girl at my usual salon is booked up or out of town.", "rating": "3", "date": [2012, 5, 10]}, "10": {"description": "When I go to a salon I expect to see name brand products.

The owners are new, and the lady who does the henna is different. The previous artist was awesome. The current artist does great designs, but I think the tip of the bag was cut off too much, it was very thick. While I was waiting for the first half to dry, I sent a photo to my girlfriends, they thought it was cool and asked what color it was. I was expecting brown, as it should be, but I asked the artist, and she said it was black. I'm very white and was a little concerned at that point. I also recalled hearing before that some black henna was bad. So before bed, I went online to see when I could wash my skin. I found a few pages saying no black henna is good. Natural henna is brown, and the only way it can be black, is if it has a bunch of chemicals in it. I saw photos of people's skin scarring and breaking out from it. I went into panic mode and scrubbed for about 20 mins in the shower. Luckily, I haven't had a reaction. The black is terrible though, it was put on so thick, that it looks like somebody drew on me with a sharpie. The only way I would return, is if it was natural brown, and was able to be applied much thinner. If you are going to risk it and go for black henna, I would suggest shaving the area.

The reason is quite simply this: whoever owns or manages this store has NO SOUL! Why, you ask? Well, on your way out, turn your head to your right and you will see a wall of shame.

These are clearly hungry people! Half the photos are of crying mothers with babies in their arms and small children at their side (and the food items they tried to take laid out in front of them). It is sickening that they would treat people like that. I'm not saying those people had a right to walk in at take what they want, but they don't deserve that kind of treatment. You got your items back. Ban them from the store if you want. Even, have them arrested... if you feel it's necessary (which I don't), but this is out of line. And don't get me wrong. I'm the farthest thing from someone soft on crime. I believe rapist, murders, terrorist, and child abusers should all have public (and painful) executions. They deserve no less.

Located in a small storefront half-block east of Pulaski, this is a real Mexican's Mexican restaurant.Remarkably affordable with plentiful servings of great food sums it up best. The walls, painted red in swirly, stucco-like fashion, display Mexican art. Since the dining area is pretty small, it almost feels like coming over to eat at someone's home. When we arrived, there was a large family with children eating lunch. Spanish country music from WOJO FM played in the background. For the duration of my 45-minute stay at the restaurant, I think I was the only non-Hispanic customer in the place but I felt right at home anyway.The waitress didn't speak much English, so both of my co-workers ordered in Spanish. I said \"Carne asada burrito\" instead of steak burrito to do my benchmark burrito test on the place. I also got a side of rice and beans and a tall glass of horchata. Despite her limited English, she got my order correct.The guys ordered their favorite, as this is the home of the $3 tortas. Not a lame torta served on a hamburger bun, but a massive sammich loaded with meat, thick slices of avocado and other toppings, covering the entire plate! The bread looked home-baked, not mass produced. My steak burrito was excellent too. So big, in fact, that it was cut in half. We also shared a bowl of chips and 2 dishes of salsa: red and green. The red was the hotter of the two but a bit too oily for my liking. The green salsa was perfect: just the right amount of kick balanced with the perfect flavor enhancement for the burrito.In the end, I paid less than $8 for a massive burrito, 2 sides and the horchata drink. You can't easily top that at any nearby places I know.Besides your lunch & dinner items, they also have an extensive breakfast menu with eggs, Mexican sausage or omelette.

The outside skin was extremely crispy, while the inside was juicy and tender. The two flavors we got were spicy Korean, and sweet garlic. I enjoyed the sweet garlic, it tasted like a mixture of honey and garlic. I wasn't a huge fan of the spicy Korean. The sauce isn't very spicy, and it tasted a little weird. I wasn't sure if it was made from soy sauce, or something else. It was unique, and I just couldn't figure out if I liked it or not. There are other sauces, but we just didn't order them. 2.) I wouldn't recommend the calamari. It's squid tempura, and it's just nothing special. The tempura batter and quality of the squid weren't memorable.3.)

The lady greeted us with a genuine smile and seated us immediately. Water and the menus followed right after. I told her about the free small hummus with a check-in and she acknowledged it and brought it out. Something else she did was allow my sister to also get another free hummus with her check-in too! We were very thankful for her kindness. Not only was the hummus free, it was probably the best hummus I've ever had. It was so nicely blended and seasoned and served with pita bread. This hummus also had some lemon and olive oil mixed into it - nicely and perfectly executed. I ordered the combo platter which had chicken kebab, chicken shawarma, beef, and yellow rice with it. Delicious! Wow, I almost ordered one to go. It was seasoned so brilliantly. The meats were so tender and flavorful. My bro ordered the stuffed grapes leaves too. I've never had that so it was nice to try it for the first time. Very simple yet yummy! Also, best falafel I've ever had! Service was excellent here! She was so nice and did a great job. She kept getting us more water, bringing out pita bread, asked us if we needed anything else, etc. She even went back and gave us separate checks when we asked.

What that means is that you are not attending an authentic Korean BBQ when visiting Chicago Kalbi but an amazing Japanese fusion instead.Upon entering the restaurant a flood of delightfully pungent smoke billows into the vestibule. You hear the sizzling of grills all around the restaurant; plenty of laughter and a great deal of Japanese. If you were wondering, yes, this is in fact heaven. The restaurant is always staffed by an older Japanese couple (owners), two young Japanese servers (one male and one female), and several Hispanic men who bus. Each one of these individuals is very good at their job and has a certain level of enthusiasm about their fare that is nothing short of adorable and endearing.The tables in the restaurant are all separated by partitions, giving you a very private experience in a typically bustling restaurant. Sometimes you might have to wait 30 minutes but DO IT! You will regret it if you do not. The tables are wood constructed with a covered, hollow metal core. You can choose to have BBQ where they will fill the interior with a charcoal filled dutch oven with a grill rack atop or simply order menu items. The latter is inexcusable - because I said so.Every time I go, I go with one other person. I recommend no more than four, otherwise you might have to wait much longer than I stated, particularly on a Friday or Saturday. I see larger parties though so please don't let this deter you.The combo set is the way to go. It comes in three different options with varying meats. I always opt for the kalbi, bulgogi and chicken. The set comes with those meats, many delicious small salads, miso soup and green tea ice cream for dessert. In addition to that I get the veggies, one other a la carte meat and an occasional appetizer. This is the ideal amount of food for two people. You will feel so pleasantly full at the end of the experience but not heavy or lethargic in the least. Other meats I've tried and enjoyed are: the squid; shrimp; short rib; kobe beef (wagyu); heart; and tongue. I've also tried the yukke which is delicious though I strongly advise against ordering it. The only reason being I do not know the source of the meat and if it comes from one of the 13 large meat processing facilities in the US the likelihood of it containing e coli is significant. I have never been sick from it but if you have children they should not be eating raw, ground beef. The impact of the e coli on their systems is completely different from adults and cases of those infections are beyond tragic. If you are concerned about the meat, ask them if they know the source. If the meat comes from a small packaging facility that adheres to sanitation requirements the likelihood of that pathogen is significantly reduced. Regardless, eat that one dish with caution, though if you do get it I will say it's one of my favorite items. It's so silky with a great balance of sweet, salty and savory flavors.In addition to my meal, I also order a large Sapporo, and a small bottle of jumai ginjo sake. While one person cooks the meat, the other prepares a shot of sake for us to toast in appreciation of the bountiful fare and excellent service we receive. The sake washes down the well marinated and perfectly cooked (I'm a master!) meat with nostalgic delight.

What is the point of collecting these coupons when all they are going to do is swear at customers and refuse service. I used to love this pizza place but I don't anymore.

I have tried a few different things--pretzels and garlic bread apps (nothing special)--but my partner and I are creatures of habit. I adore their stuffed pizza, we almost always get pepperoni and pineapple. I don't have a snooty palette, and I think poor pizza is still, at least, pizza. This pizza is my favorite. I love the gooeyness of the massive amounts of cheese and the sometimes flimsy, sometimes crispy crust. (More often, the crust is flimsy under the weigh of the pizza's innards; the softness complements the gooey cheese, IMO. The crispier crust made the pizza easier to hold. Although there was a variety, this place is still pretty consistent. Plus, consistency is boring and bespeaks of taking the humanity out of food production.)SERVICE: The servers and bartenders are always friendly, and there tends to be only one server, sometimes that server is also the bartender (at least at the early evening weekday hour I go). Sure, sometimes that means the service isn't Johnny-on-the-spot, but they are always super nice and very eager to serve you (and they keep a good watch on my emptying cup of beer). Since I'm not an asshole who thinks the world and every customer service worker should revolve around my whims, the sort of service I find at Golden Crust means a lot to me. I don't know his name, but the bartender there most Monday nights is an incredibly friendly guy with some great tatts--I always love it when he is there.ATMOSPHERE: I generally go early Monday evenings to dine in, otherwise I'll do take out. I don't like crowded and loud places. Since Golden Crust is a bar, you would expect it to be both of those things. In the summer, the place tends to be more crowded, because their patio is nearly the same size as their dining area. Sometimes the music is a bit loud; it's a bar, they get a pass on that. However, they sometimes don't turn the music on until the evening progresses. This past week, they had no music on, but I could hear just enough of Con Air on the TVs that I could follow the movie. Like most bars, the TVs show people sportsing in various manners.

Aprox yr ago Order pizza for 7 kids. Pretty simple. XL Thin Crust Cheese and Sausage only. Pizza arrives with all kinds of veggies and call GC asap. The girl at the time (which is the same girl that has given me trouble last 4 orders) proceeds to tell me that the best she could do is give me $10 off on my next order wtf?? Manager explains the same. \u00a0\"There is a $37 order in front of me that 7 kids will not eat because you guys screwed up and now you want me to spend another $26+ to correct the problem?\" both said yes. Unacceptable. Run to Little caesars pick up a couple to feed the kids asap!! This also happened during a bears game last year. 2 XL THIN CRUST and sides we're talking $70+ order.. pizzas were screwed up somehow and all they could do at the time was give us a measly credit of $10 towards our next order. What kind of policy is this? If I order A and you give me B, why should I pay extra to correct this?? on that order we tried so hard to get the manager to understand how wrong this was that he just hung up on us. 2. About 4 yrs ago a buddy suggested we have them bake the Crushed pepper into our pizza. Wow was that a good Idea. GC has done this on many occasions for us ever since. It's only when this girl answers that THIS is not possible. \"It's not how we make our pizza's sir\" \"It's not an ingredient sir\" \"The cooks wont do it sir\" BS this has been done many times before. Charge me extra if you want just make this happen please. \"Sorry sir, I can't\" ok Thanks!!3.

It's 4 adults and a 6yo \u00a0that freaks out if there's anything else on his cheese pizza. \"Sorry sir that's not possible\" She tells me that they can do 1/3 cheese and how that will be cheaper for me. I tell her that I don't care what it costs, charge me DELUXE for the whole pizza and just make 1/4 or few end slices JUST CHEESE. \"Sorry sir our system doesn't work that way\" It got me thinking that maybe there is only the option of 1/3 in the computer so I ask her If she could kindly go ask the guys in the back, as they are loading pizza with toppings, to not add toppings to the end of it, aprox 3 slices. \"Sorry sir that isn't possible\" HOW THE HELL IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE? once again this has been done in the past but getting her to understand that is not happening. This girl can not think outside the box to help a loyal customer of over 20 years now. She had no answer for me.

However, the leftovers are great and reheat very well. I will say that the crust remains deliciously crispy even with delivery, which is not always the case. I can't comment on many other items on the menu, although the fried veggie appetizer is always good (and also filling)! I've only had this dine-in though so can't comment on it from delivery. Delivery service has always been prompt (early!) and spot on quality. Dine-in experience has been good as well. There is a nice patio that is weatherized so allowed for some nice fall patio meals. Also, they have a FANTASTIC selection of craft beers. The decor is warm and welcoming, particularly the lighting and Blackhawks wall. It does double as a sports bar though, so during big games gets a bit loud (just in case that's NOT what you're looking for during big games).

The owner was friendly and we talked for a bit afterwards. I could not help but notice how new everything looked and how clean this place was. The crowd at nicks is very diverse and It was a good sign to see everyone enjoying themselves and laughing. There was music playing that gave this place a cool atmosphere. It ranged from EDM to billboards top 50. Which was okay by me. The tables played great. I Guess because they were new. No dead rails and weird rolls.

The people who work there are super cool. We changed what we wanted like 10 times and the guy was super patient about it. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a 1/2 pound of the cod. The guy rang us up and told us to give him 12 minutes. No problemo with all the magazines laying around the place we kept ourselves busy.While we were waiting I read the signage which said they weigh the fish BEFORE they batter and cook it. I find that extremely fair considering the great prices they have in there. I wanted the crab cakes but they were out. He said that they make 8 or 9 of them every day so that they are always fresh.We got our food and yessss oh yessss it was delicious.

When I saw the old fashion barber pole outside, I knew I had found the place! Mind you, the haircuts are over twice the other places in the neighborhood but Frank is a \"barber\" and not a \"hair stylist\". What's the difference? A barber is to a hair stylist as a violin is to a fiddle. It's the same thing executed differently. Frank is a kind man who has been cutting hair for around 50 years. He will remind you that he worked at a barber shop in the Music Box Theater building on Southport a long time ago. Recently he moved to his current location from across the street when a developer at his old location thought that this filthy urban intersection was the new Lincoln Park. I've seen a lot of people at Frank's since I've been going here. It's very popular w/ the police and fathers w/ their sons. However, I've never seen a woman in Frank's. This is a man's place! Of the many magazines on the table here, you won't see a Vogue or Us Magi zine, it's Car and Driver here. The haircuts are a lot more than just Frank using the clippers.

The shop is in Albany Park. The product is superior to that of a major neighboring bakery, but it is still not that good.I purchased a tray of assorted baklava type Middle Eastern pastries. Having tasted one of each of the six types of pastry, I find all of them to be so-so in flavor. The ingredients need an upgrade. The pastries themselves are well put together: good handling of the pastry dough.These are two of the ingredients that are absent from Jaafer's baklava: butter and honey. There might be others, but these two are pretty fundamental components to standard baklava. The overall effect of their absence creates a flavor-dead filo dough drenched in sugar syrup.Perhaps there are no bakeries in Chicago that produce genuine baklava. Jaafer does not. However, Jaafer's product is superior to that of a major, well-known bakery down the street.In short, Jaafer Sweets is a disappointment.10-2-11 (update)Having read the other reviews, I should let Yelpers know that I have a high regard for the hospitality of the shop owners and workers that I met during my visit. The woman was welcoming and extremely enthusiastic. She was also genuinely interested in getting feedback regarding Jaafer's product. The man offered us both a complimentary drink. We had to decline because we were in a hurry, so I'm not sure what it was he was offering to us.My experience with Jaafer was entirely consistent with meeting small business owners, ones who are actually running the business and greeting customers. To me, they seemed genuinely interested in growing their business and working with customers. I don't know if this is entirely \"good service\", but it is good business practice, and their attitude was genuinely hospitable.

You can mix and match most varieties of sweets for $9.99 a pound with 1 or 2 types being a little more expensive.

Perhaps they should think about assigning two guides per tour group to ensure all \"basic\" questions can answered. I gave our tour guide a benefit of the doubt and thought maybe their newer, so I asked the individual refilling our beers, but they didn't know either.

I've been on many brewery tours and this one was my favorite. 1) The advertise unlimited samples. They really do give you unlimited samples. I believe the expression they used was: \"We aren't in school.\" If you wanted to stand at the table the whole time and drink, they really wouldn't care. 2) They specifically tell you why they don't have signage. They can't sell beer from that location. I read a few reviews that were all jazzed up about that point. Look up the address and go to that address. Not that hard. 3) I will say that our tour guide, specifically, was awesome and extremely knowledgeable. I understand that this can vary, so for those who didn't have Frank, I'm so so sorry for you.4) Some of the other complaints I saw were that of \"there's no seating\" or \"the tour is too short\", etc etc. I mean, you're paying $10 for unlimited beer, (generous samples too), a free pint glass, and a little info. I think if you're paying more, you can complain about things, but this is clearly not going to be anything more than a $10 operation, and it was an awesome one! Have some more beer and chill out. 5) Hopefully they open up a tap room where you can just hang out and actually buy merch, because while it wasn't a huge deal not to be able to buy their product after the tour, that certainly is a fun part of many brewery tours.

I've been on so many beer tours now, the information is of course repetitive and unless a tour does something exciting to spice it up (a la Argus Brewery), it gets monotonous. Prior to the tour starting, you can immediately start getting samples of their brews. Generous samples. I'm talking they basically fill up your entire pint glass sample. If you haven't been on a brewery tour before, you will find it very informative. They take you around their brewery while going through the brew process. I picked up some bits and pieces as I do with each brewery tour but I didn't find anything overly unique about the Finch tour. Once the tour finishes, they give you a completely reasonable time limit to hang out and have more 'samples' (ie their really full pint pours). They had all their signature brews on tap (Threadless IPA, Facist Pig & Cut Throat Pale Ale) + one cool new one (Wet Hot American Wheat) + some bottled brews to try. If your goal is to drink on a tour, they will go above & beyond your goal. The downside is there isn't a single chair in sight so you have to stand the entire time you're drinking. Personally I'm not a fan of standing & drinking and could have stayed longer to sip more drinks, but jetted after the tour due to this.

Having lived in NYC, I have trouble finding places where the look, style, and range of desirable clothing I want gets close to what SOHO or Brooklyn can offer, so I was very skeptical to say the least, but sometimes, your expectations are blown out of the water. In short...this place really really thoroughly impressed me for the following reasons:1) The range of selection is incredible..any size, a wide price range, any type of dye, any style of denim...you name it, this place has got it.2) Whoever merchandises has got a great eye. No...not everything in there will fancy your interest, but it'll be absurd for any store to be that way. But every item I picked up was reasonably priced relative to its quality and design. Someone here clearly hand picks each item and thinks about not just the style but the fit, quality, and value of an item...very impressed overall. This is such a hard thing to do right...finding an agreeable point of value and quality/design that offers maximum value for the customer and store.3) Service...yes, the service is fantastic. Having worked very closely with a lot of retail clients, service is soooooo tough in a retail environment. It's not just that the service is very knowledgeable and genuinely helpful, but the it's consistently very excellent. That's hard to accomplish in any retail environment (clothing, food, cafes, etc.). Rain or shine, there's always someone knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to help you out. And if you don't want to be bothered, they give you your space too. But if you're serious about picking up the perfect pair of jeans, listen to these folks. They know their stuff in and out.4) I know this place is known for their denim...but everything else is pretty fantastic too. Mildblend doesn't have quite the range of tops relative to their expansive collection of denim, but it's still a very solid offering. And guess what, they know their strength and specialty is denim, and they are hands down the best in that department. With regards to tops, footwear, accessories, etc., perhaps not the biggest selection, but as stated earlier, someone's got a great eye for style, quality, and value.Truth of the matter is...if you're the type that goes to the store, tries everything on, and then goes online to find the same thing at the cheapest place possible, I'm confident that these guys will still provide incredible service and expose you to new brands, styles, fits, etc. to make sure you find what you're looking for or didn't know worked well for you. But I value everything these guys offer outside of just the product. I will walk out with not just exactly what I had in mind but something better, because of the experience and knowledge of the people who work here. They don't care about selling you what's most expensive or in stock or hip...they genuinely care about what works for you. That is the biggest hallmark of an excellent store. If that means paying a little extra...and I mean very very little, I'm totally fine. Their pricing is very competitive for the stuff they offer. Not only that, they take really good care of you after the sale and also hem your jeans...try doing that with an online place. Truth of the matter is, the pricing for most of these goods are controlled anyway, so you wouldn't even find a better deal online.I'm thoroughly impressed.

Her bedside manner was nonexistant and she really made no effort to impart any sense of hope to us.The optometrist said that she was not comfortable treating his eye because the prognosis was so poor, so she would prefer to refer us to a cornea specialist, an actual M.D. with a concentration in opthalmology. Unfortunately, since it was Saturday, there was no specialist available to come and we were given the options of going to the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial, who has an opthalmologist available, or for the optometrist at Lawrence Vision Center to perform \"the procedure\" (what exactly she planned to do was still a mystery). Terrified but definitely sure we wanted a second opinion, we opted to go to Northwestern Memorial, where we were stunned that our confident and articulate doctors told us that my boyfriend's prognosis was great! Aside from being painful and light sensitive, the cornea should heal within 48-72 hours with the antibiotic drops given. After doing the exact same basic tests that the optometrist at Lawrence Vision Center did, they confirmed that the scratch was not in his field of vision and his vision would not be affected at all. We were stunned that we received such drastic diagnoses and prognoses at the two different clinics, but it seemed that the Northwestern Memorial doctors were not necessarily surprised, considering optometrists do not receive significan opthalmology training.

The chicken tacos here are the best and the most authentic tasting. I say that meaning that I feel the chicken taco had the most dimensional layers of everything family-owned little Mexican restaurants bring to the table in the way of flavor and spices. The aroma of the warm corn tortilla fused beautifully with the marinated chicken, cilantro, and onions.

I just found the fish bland like it needed more spices or something to jazz it up. The steak taco was definitely dry, and I wouldn't come back for these a second time. I was definitely taken with the creamier side salsas they offer to pour over the tacos. The green was my favorite, but it still wasn't enough for the fish tacos.You don't come here for the atmosphere, but I definitely feel like the restaurant is too bright inside. I'd try to make the place look a little more inviting by using candles on the table or just dimmer lights. Otherwise I feel like El Gallo Bravo is par for the Mexican genre of 24-hour restaurants. They don't have to be fancy. All they need to do is keep on delivering the same quality of amazing service I received while I was there and that takes you far in the restaurant industry.

The cherry pie is kind of amazing, with a lattice crust and juicy, tart cherries. They also make a good pecan pie, which is one of my favorite types of pie. The red wine poached pear pie is scrumptious. But the blueberry pie...oh, the blueberry pie is the stuff that dreams are made of. That is, of course, if you are lucky enough to stop by on the rare occasions that they have blueberry pie. There are a few tried and true classic pies that are always available, but then there are a few rotating flavors in their repertoire, as well.Everything that I have had to eat, not just the pie, has been delicious. The duck and mozzarella sandwich is a personal favorite, with mounds of duck meat piled high on crusty bread and topped with mozzarella, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms.

It was surprisingly amazing, especially after being warmed up in the oven.Meat Pie - a pita with meat and spices baked on top. The meat has a nice nutmegy flavor, but needs a bit more zing. I suggest finding a sauce you like to eat it with, or maybe heating it up with some cheese on top.Pita Bread - a HUGE stack of fresh, tasty pitas for just a few dollars. Just like what they would give you at a restaurant with some hummus.Oregano & Sesame spiced pita - Definitely different, but also quite good.Pistachio Baklava/Cookie- They actually have pistachio only treats, which is great for me since I'm allergic to walnuts and can't usually enjoy baklava. It is crispy and has the distinct flavor of honey and nuts. The texture and taste is just perfect.Overall, I think Tannourine is a great new place in the Albany Park hood, especially since they have great, friendly staff as well as really low prices.

But, to the best of my knowledge, there are only two unwritten rules: The first rule is that you never wear jeans to a strip club. Always slacks or (if you're a lady or a gentlemen who doesn't care) a skirt or dress. This has nothing to do with being classy. Once you've been to one, you know the reason why so I won't discuss it here. The second rule, imparted to me by a wise bro is \"no dude wants to roll into a strip club alone.\" This just looks kind of creepy. \"Sitting in the waiting room...\" Well the 240 Lounge has solved this problem for the Admiral Theater. Located a few doors down, the 240 literally serves as that particular strip club's waiting room. It's a low key bar where patrons of the other establishment can meet up, pre-lube, and, well, if you've been to the Admiral, sometimes decide not to leave. I mean, this bar plays the same kind of songs as you'd hear at the strip club and there are photos of the Admiral's strippers on the wall. \u00a0So it's almost the same.Since the Admiral is a dry strip club, this is also the place to get sauced using the in/out privileges at the Theater. Though drinks, for how divey this bar is, are a bit pricey - especially considering this is Albany Park. There are some good specials, though, including $3 redheaded sluts! I'm not much of a shot drinker, but I do love a good redheaded slut. They also serve a blue balls shot for the same price, but I didn't want to try that. It didn't seem enjoyable. \"Sitting in the waiting room...\" Maybe needless to say, the one and only time I've been here, the group of guys next to me as I was waiting for my two peeps (maybe I shouldn't use that word for a bar next to a strip club) were downing jagerbombs (yeah, it's that sort of clientele). But the bartenders are chill and friendly no matter what drink you get. \"Because they can't get up!\" They also have karaoke, just in case you're looking for an \"excuse\" to be here that doesn't involve the building next door (or does and you're just looking for a reason to lie about your whereabouts). \u00a0Maybe that's the unwritten third rule of a strip club...plausible deniability.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 12, 8]}, "10": {"description": "Blacked out windows greet you from outside, I could tell why once I stepped inside.Having been summoned to this bar for an old friend's birthday, I got to this bar before my friends had finished Korean BBQ down the street at Chicago Kalbi.

Unfortunately, that still doesn't mean it's so great. For some unfathomable reason, although the neighborhood is packed with Mexican people, there are no particularly good Mexican restaurants here - just a few that are cheap-ish and not too terrible. \u00a0CASH ONLY too, so be prepared. OK, the food - The meat is flavorful (you never find chicken-skin in the tacos, unlike so many places) the coffee is tasty when it's good, but too often obviously stale, sometimes it's brewed too weak. Spotty quality of something not-too-difficult to get right like coffee kind of makes me wonder if the effort spent on sanitation is similarly uneven or lackadaisical. OTOH, the tomatoes are always RED and plump, not those pointless translucent little cubes of wet nothing you get so many other places. Cilantro is always well washed and onions always chopped neatly and tiny. They know how to make vegetarian items, unlike some places that don't seem to know what the word \"vegetarian\" means. Avocado torta & an order of veg. quesidillas (with savory grilled peppers & onion) make a nice & affordable veg meal big enough for 2 to share. Maybe unsurprisingly the quality of the avocados is sometimes good sometimes less than good. It's understandable that sometimes an item of produce is just not great, but if avocados suck this week, I'd rather have them off the menu than be served a brown stringy avocado like it's no big deal. To me it's a big-ish deal enough deal that I don't want to pay for an only semi-edible avocado. Food made to order generally comes the WAY you ordered it, especially if you can order in Spanish. In English it's hit-or-miss. (I've lived here 10 years now, some of the waitresses have been working here the whole time and their English - even just food on their own menu related English - has not improved one iota in that decade, so I'm assuming it's not any kind of priority, which is kind of lame.) The tables and bathroom do always seem clean, and the sink is low enough that my 3 year old can reach it wash her own hands, which makes her very happy. The staff are generally friendly and basically competent. (As mentioned, their English isn't anywhere near 100%, or even 50% so be prepared to be patient. If you get frozen salsa as one reviewer claimed to, by all means send it back. They are nice enough people, if they make a mistake they will fix it, I'm sure. Also FYI the cheese is a burrito isn't supposed to be melted, if you order a burrito, expect the cheese inside to be cold and unmelted, if it was hot enough to melt cheese in there, the veg. ingredients would be wilted, and the sour cream would be nasty.)Don't waste your time looking for cheap tacos anywhere else, you won't find better in the immediate neighborhood. You can definitely find some better ones in Andersonville & Lincoln Square, maybe Ravenswood, but not in Albany Park. These are the ONLY tacos in the neighborhood half as good as the ones I make at home. \u00a0:)Stop by on your way to Ronan & River Park, watch the geese swim in the river, and feel happy you live in wonderful Albany Park. I've lowered my rating although the food is generally decent, and the staff is nice, if unskilled in English speaking, I am super tired of the TVs playing loud, violent soap operas & loud, sadistic, sexist Mexican westerns, and the plastic everything, and in the last 6 months I've gotten nothing but weak stale coffee.

One thing I didn't like is that the sauces are extra and the service wasn't too friendly. I had to ask for sauce 3 times before they brought it and they weren't nice about it.

As I kept cutting off chunks with my spoon, I noticed that the chicken was not cooked so I tried the second piece and that wasn't cooked either. I told the waitress and she came back to the table with a spoon and plate. She shoved me to the side so she can take the chicken off my plate. So the cook put my chicken that I had touched with my silverware on the grill that they put everyone else's food. Yes so you might have ate my left over chicken friends. 10 minutes later I received my burnt boneless chickens with oil dripping from it. I was so disgusted I told the owner and he said that the heat kills everything so it was ok to put my food back on the grill. That is absolutely disgusting and I have never been to a restaurant that does that. So be aware the next time you eat there because you might be eating someone else's food too.

Right off the bat, they forgot to include the pita bread, which is pretty essential. They did deliver it to us in a relatively timely manner, but just check your to go orders. It was an honest mistake and if the food had been edible, I would have given them a pass on that. Unfortunately, the food was hardly edible. Maybe I just have high standards living close enough to frequent Olive Mediterranean Grill, Naf Naf Grill, and Pita Inn. Or maybe this food was just gross. The dolmades were fine, nothing special. The falafel had the strangest texture. It was really spongey, dry, and lackluster in the flavor department. Honestly, it reminded me of a vaginal sea sponge. They were edible though. The hummus and Jerusalem salad were edible as well, but they're both pretty difficult to f*** up. The baba ganoush, however, was easily the most inedible food I've ever encountered. It was sour, tasted nothing like eggplant, and I couldn't stomach more than one bite. At this point the pita bread arrived and I was sure they couldn't f*** that up. How is it that Trader Joe's pitas taste better than this cardboard from a traditional Mediterranean restaurant?! Your guess is as good as mine.

I had an extremely \"meh\" experienceI went here with two other people. Nice spot with the open windows and high ceilings, but weird tables that don't fit the space, leaving it to be very cramped and awkward.Poor service, as we had to ask a couple of times for water, napkins, and silverware, and eventually ended up just getting most of those items ourselves, which the waitress then seemed irritated by.One person ordered Maust Museer, a creamy dill yogurt with pita bread which was delicious. She also ordered a bowl of their vegetable soup, which was so oily (we all tried it), it was basically inedible. No flavor, just oil. We shared an order of falafel, which was different than any falafel I have ever had. It was fluffy, almost bread like. It's possible the chick peas were ground to a more fine flour, but I did not prefer these at all. They did not taste very fresh and had little flavor compared to the dozens of other times I've had falafel. Then they brought another order of falafel, and that's when the confusion began. One of the people with me said \"You already brought us our falafel.\" The waitress panicked and said \"That's ok- we'll give it to someone else\" and took it away. I told her we were waiting for our entrees and she looked totally confused. I and the other person who had not already had the soup waited for our entrees, and the owner (?) came over to tell us that the orders had been duplicated in the system so we would simply get double our food. We didn't get double our food. They just brought us two of the same entree- not the one I had actually ordered, but doubles of what my dining partner had ordered. At this point, we were short on time and frustrated by the weirdness and lack of service, so I just ate a little of my entree and brought it home for later. The reason for two stars?

Slightly overrated. Presented as a \"higher-end\" taco but many street taco counterparts are better. Seems as if care went into the preparation. Fat was trimmed off of the meat nicely (or meat was nicely chosen). Too much sauce. Barely any cabbage. Very, very, skimpy on the meat. Concept not very unique. Simple (although simple isn't bad). Would be worth it if portions were fair and sauce was not heavy. All protiens were cooked nicely. Food was seasoned well. Price compared to portion is shameful (especially in that neighborhood & in Illinois). Tortillas nice and fresh but small. Guacamole was good but overpriced. Fresh (like all other good taco spots). Creative but mimics an overdone food truck concept. Overall, should have more of a humble approach to what is offered. When it comes to tacos it just comes to freshness, great meat, and flavor... This being said, you can find great and \"fairly\" priced tacos in Chicago and T&b Grill is not that spot. There are many other places that offer tacos that are not skimpy, of quality meat, complimented by great salsas, and made with fresh ingredients.

There are several rooms that could accommodate small to large groups of people. Staff were friendly but some could be a little more knowledgable about the dishes on the menu, like hotness. I was told to try Arun's specials. He makes them daily but does change the specials out dependent on the season. Would highly recommend this place especially if you like Thai food.

We picked a variety of cocktails, tacos, guacs, and a few other treats. Everything was good, and a few things are great.

Green Curry Shrimp tacos are fire. The Baja tacos are on point, but the sleeper hit for me is the butternut squash and cotija cheese taco. Fantastic! The caramelized sweetness of the squash goes perfectly with the earthiness of the cheese. My husband raves about the chorizo tacos and pork shank, although I've never personally ordered them. The guacamole is tasty and comes with crispy tortillas that you break into pieces for dipping. I love the churros and chocolate dipping sauce. Honestly, I've never met a churro I didn't like, but these babies are freshly fried and almost melt in your mouth- really, really good. Drinks:I wasn't a huge fan of mezcal before, but this place has converted me. Their margaritas are the best I've had in the city. The mezcal's earthiness shines and is balanced by the sour sweetness of the lime, not drowned out by it. Many of the other places I've been to in Chicago that are known for their margaritas drown their drinks in syrup and go light on the tequila. Not here. I can have several of the Fulano Margaritas without getting sugar shock, plus you get a mini shot on the side. One drink and you can start to feel the effects of the mezcal- hooray for saving money!

Then I order one cheese pupusa which was truly authentic. Then I had some \"empanadas (or pastelitos) de leche\", this is made out of fried plantains and it was really good...In addition I also tried the \"yuca frita\" (cassava fries) which was just good.

When I think Hooka bar I think lots of couches or even pillows on the floor for congregation. This place had uncomfortable chairs which resemble that of a hospital waiting room. The couches, which we snagged immediately walking in, were at least comfortable, however, the cleanliness of them leaves a disturbing thought in my head.My friend and I got a hooka with apple tabaco which tasted more like licorice... odd, yes. The other oddity was that they only brought us a hooka with one hitter (I dunno the actual terminolgoy of it) instead of two. I had to keep placing and removing my mouth guard so as to not share germs with my friend. I would have loved a glass of wine or a beer to sip with the hooka but they didn't offer alcohol which was definately a bummer. I'm not sure if it's a BYOB establishment - if I find out that it is I will give this place a second chance. However, they did have cappacinos and other beverages like soda and I believe some foreign drinks. I\"m not brave enough to try those so I'll have to wait to review that until a brave or familiar friend goes with me LOL. The other annoyance I had was with a group of 4 men who were playing rummy and getting so worked up that they sounded as if they'd get in a fist fight. Granted I laughed at the time but that was merely to not look annoyed and risk getting yelled at myself. The staff did nothing to settle the men down out of respect for the other patrons.

To say the least, it was a hair raising experience as I hadn't expected it and I was holding my breath as the razor went across my skin and neatening my hairline. After a quick fifteen minute haircut I paid my $5 and tipped the guy $15 since I enjoyed the place so much.As compared to We Care Hair down the street, Vanessa's and Wendy's is more geared towards the entire family.

She helped me navigate through charts unknown.I never knew there could be so much in the selection of the winter cap. Maybe that's why all my life I've avoided trying to shop for one. She helped me steer away from a plain knit with a masculine and functional look to one that was more delicate and feminine. Who knew?! Since I bought it, I love wearing my cap. And it sure solves the cold head problem as well.Secretly, I go around gloating the joys of being a girl who can wear a femme cap.

Everything arrived well-packaged with ample sides of salsa, table settings, napkins, etc.My dining buddy got the nachos with meat.

My tacos? Fantastic. As other reviewers have noted, the quality of the meat at Roy y Moy's is out of the world. And to hit that $15 order miminum? I tried pretty much every one on the menu. Chorizo, as mentioned prior, was deliciously spicy, greasy, and exactly what it should be. Carne asada had beautiful grill marks and wasn't dried out from too much time on the griddle. Picadillo was lean but still retained its moisture and was perfectly spiced. And the al pastor? I think Roy y Moy's just stole my heart for best pastor in Albany Park. Sweet, tender, and without a piece of gristle in sight, I even talked my pork-wary dining companion into nibbling a piece. ...And gushing over it.Oh. And the beans. Order a side. Or two.

Everything arrived well-packaged with ample sides of salsa, table settings, napkins, etc.My dining buddy got the nachos with meat. A steal at $6.50, these were very lightly salted crispy chips topped with marvelously spicy, oily, crumbly chorizo, a heavy-handed topping of mild white cheese, lettuce, tomato, and several dollops of sour cream. My tacos? Fantastic. As other reviewers have noted, the quality of the meat at Roy y Moy's is out of the world. And to hit that $15 order miminum? I tried pretty much every one on the menu. Chorizo, as mentioned prior, was deliciously spicy, greasy, and exactly what it should be. Carne asada had beautiful grill marks and wasn't dried out from too much time on the griddle. Picadillo was lean but still retained its moisture and was perfectly spiced. And the al pastor? I think Roy y Moy's just stole my heart for best pastor in Albany Park. Sweet, tender, and without a piece of gristle in sight, I even talked my pork-wary dining companion into nibbling a piece. ...And gushing over it.Oh. And the beans. Order a side. Or two. Roy y Moy's beans are hit with a heavy dose of chicken stock, rendering them rich, filling, and far more flavorful than any other Mexican restaurant's I've been to.

I have the innate ability of detecting the teeniest piece of dark meat even if it's mixed with white meat chicken. The carne asada was nothing less than outstanding.

Their similar sesame chicken has never disappointed. The soups are all great. They make smoothies in a variety of fruit flavors.The tastiness and quality of food is comparable to what you'd get at a casual dining Chinese restaurant.

I had been reluctant for three whole years to go to the Good Morning Clinic because I was frightened by the thought of getting an accidental colonic. And, on a side note, I'm the worst person ever to give a gift card to. I never use them.I finally decided to make an appointment because I've really been in need of a massage. I figured I would brave it out and give Good Morning Clinic a try. When I called to make my appointment, I clearly stated to the receptionist that I wanted to make an appointment for a massage. Three times she replied, \"So, that's a colonic at 11? Or, \"so a colonic and a massage at 11?\" Or, \"I'll see you at 11 for the colonic.\" And, after reiterating three separate times that I'd like ONLY a massage, this receptionist called the day before my appointment to remind me that my 11:00 appointment for my colonic was tomorrow. YIKES!!! I arrived at the Good Morning Clinic, still a bit nervous that I might be receiving a colonic, at 11:00 sharp. The office was empty, aside from the small space heater and me. And, it was FREEZING. I began to dread what might come next. I waited, next to the small space heater, just the two of us, for about 15 minutes until I was called back to my \"massage\" room. It was FREEZING. A couple of minutes later, after I was instructed to undress, the receptionist back in with the same mall space heater from the waiting room. Ok, I'm not going to give you a play by play from here but this is the basic just of it...the masseuse was 45 minutes late. The music was Frank Sinatra soft rock-style, no words, just piano. It was so cold in the room, the masseuse had to get another space heater and some warm packs to put on my back so I wasn't shivering. The electricity went out three times, I assume from the excessive use of space heaters. Hence, I listed to the same Frank Sinatra soft rock-style song three times before I actually heard another song.

The place itself seems to have had a recent make-over from a few years back. It's not a complete overhaul, just a few additions of reproduced artwork and their menu posted over their walls which is a nice upgrade from their barren picnic checkered pattern table cloths they had back then. Another nice little treat, as a result of their change, is the addition of an appetizer. Along with your expected chips and salsa, they now serve you Frijoles Rancheros right before your dish comes out.As you sit, you are welcomed by a very friendly lady who brings you your menu and chips with salsa before asking you what you would like to drink. The chips are nicely sliced and appropriately seasoned with salt, which makes me think they may be store-bought. Their taste and texture allows me to overlook this speculation. On the table, a small bowl of green avocado based salsa, a small bowl of slices of jalapenos and carrots, and the small bowl with red salsa which goes very well with the aforementioned chips. It seems to have a hint of ketchup, but with the right amount of flavor and spiciness, it is a great match out of the three bowls for the chips that lay before you. The horchata is delicious and appears to be natural and not made from store bough instant powder as other restaurants tend to serve. As you indulge in your beverage and chips, a steaming hot bowl of frijoles rancheros is brought for you to enjoy. Although they are not the best they can potentially be when it comes to their seasoning, the frijoles are a nice touch that separates this place from other local restaurants. The taco dinner plate, although it may seem a generic plate, is a great menu item to choose as it allows you to sample up to three of their meats. Their carne asada is diced a bit too small, but its taste makes up for it as it doesn't require salt or seasoning when eaten on its own. The carne pastor is not as great as in other places, but considering only a few places are known for their carne pastor, they do an adequate job.

I do things like cure my own lox and being able to talk to the monger about that is a huge plus in my book. The types of fish are indeed rare to the average consumer and usually bought up by restaurants such as wild-caught Scottish salmon or big-eye blue fin tuna (a good reason for their slightly higher prices). On the level of wholesale sale of whole tuna, blue fin can fetch $2500 for a fish and yellow fin (ahi) might only be $800. Really, anyone who knows their sushi can attest to the beauty and wonder that is the blue fin tuna in all it's rarity in landlocked Chicago with its ahi enthusiasts. Don't get me wrong, I dig on ahi, but blue fin tuna is like trying to compare a grass fed cut of delmonico to a cafeteria's chopped steak. Speaking of steak... this place also carries kobe beef and grass-fed beef at reasonable prices. If you like steak, or any part of a cow, then you probably noticed the sharp decline in the taste of beef in the past 10 years or so as cows were shot up with hormones and feed corn instead of grass.

The husband was quite worried that the place would have that very stand-off-ish fish smell to it... like some other place most people know about... not naming any names though. But to his surprise, we strolled through the front door... and it smelled, clean. Not bleachy or fishy... but like slight ocean spray clean... it was quite refreshing.Towards the front of this small shop is a line up of a few two tops... maybe four small tables... to the left is a retail/cooler area and to the right is a small open kitchen and a neat bar top set up.... Neat white subway tiles and cool clean colors brighten up this small space.I got business done first, a gift certificate for a certain someone... not naming any names... and then we decided to have lunch... and then we went shopping. We were told that we should make reso's, since the place is so small... they serve lunch Monday thru Thursday (Maybe Friday) and they have dinner service on the weekend only.

It was served with a side of an \"Asian\" inspired slaw. So good... and chips on the side. Geez Louise! Simply wonderful. On all counts. Some people on Yelp have said that they are expensive, but you pay for what you get.... The pasta dish was about $16 and the Lobster Roll ran for $19, let me tell you... I would pay $19 over and over again for that Roll. So after filling our tummies with great seafood, we went shopping.... their selection is surely smaller than other places ie Whole Foods, Supreme Lobster... BUT.... Their selection was way more different than any place I have been too... and it didn't smell. They had Sturgeon, whole lobsters taken out their shell (being sold as \"naked\" lobsters \u00a0:), Langostinos from Chile, Scallops.... A few house made soups...

The seafood of the day was lemon fish -- I think that's the name of the fish I recall -- with vegetarian couscous. Again, I was completely wowed with this dish.At most seafood restaurants, lobster rolls seem to be the one item that everyone rushes to buy.

I had heard good things about the food and mixed things about the service. But being that this place is practically a stone's throw away, I had to check it out. We were a party of five (cues Closer to Free) with a 5PM reservation. No, there is no early bird special at Ixcateco. That's all that was available, ya jerks. Our party started with guacamole, grilled octopus salad and roasted beet salad. All were pretty tasty. The guac had a bit of a kick to it. The beets had great flavor. But the octopus... I am still dreaming of that dish. It was so tender, flavorful and spicy. I wish I had gotten an order just for myself. You are also given complimentary chips and tomatillo salsa which is also good. Entrees at our table included chicken mole, grilled pork w/pumpkin mole and veggie enchiladas. I had the chicken mole. This is an usual choice for me but to be honest.. I wanted garlic mashed potatoes which is what this dish is served with. It was also pretty chilly out and this dish sounded hearty and warming. I made the right choice. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The mole sauce was divine and the mashed potatoes were just right. My belly was happy. Of course no birthday dinner is complete with out cake. Tres leches cake, that is. I have to say, I think Ixcateco has the best tres leches cake I've ever had. It's not super heavy. It manages to be light, yet still have that super moist quality of a traditional tres leches cake. Again, I found myself wishing I had ordered a slice just for me. Now, the service. Honestly the service was not great. It was not horrible, but clearly this place is still trying to find its flow. Two of our appetizers came out pretty fast, by the time we were finished with those our third app came out. But then it took foooooorever to get our entrees. Then we got our cake, but we didn't get our coffee until after we finished said cake. That was sort of a bummer. It also took a while to get our check. So yea.... my head says this should be a 3 star review but the food bumped it up to a star. I really want this place to succeed. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

This little place takes mole to a new level. Mole is good, really good, and they serve it and several different ways. Best is the salmon with a red mole that you can lick to the last drop. Next is the dark mole chicken- the mole hear is deep, smokey, sweet, and spicy. Then the pumpkin mole was good too with hints of thanksgiving and smokeless. In terms of food to call out that's where it ends. Overall the meat was way undercooked. The chicken for example was just underdone and made the skin especially rubbery. The Pork was especially fatty - in didn't mind the fact that it was pink but had way too much fat. It was chewy and a bit gross which took away from the mole it was on. \u00a0Apps were also just ok. Tried the fried corn dough with meat and veggies on top but was a bit dry and didn't really make sense. Guacamole was good but nothing special. \u00a0Also, prices are in the high side for what u get - so be prepared to spend around $25 per person. I have to say that service and atmosphere was really attentive and nice. Bonus that right now it's a BYOB too.

Pretty sure the fifth star will come.This place has gotten a lot of good press -- richly deserved -- but it's not impossible to get into. Yet. Which is saying a lot, because it's tiny. That works for it, because it has the feel of a small family business, with the food of, well, Frontera Grill. Which is not a surprise, since the chef/owner made his bones working at Frontera and Topolobampo.The menu is as tiny as the space. Rather than trying to a little bit of everything, Ixcateco has a menu of about a dozen items. The flavors are all bright and fresh. The chef was Bayless's \"Master of Mole,\" and the restaurant opened with a lot of mole dishes. When I went, there were only one. My companion ordered the traditional black mole, which had the complexity that comes of a three-day process. I had the adobo-marinated carne asada, wood grilled and served with a fresh tomato sauce and black beans. Simple, but delicious.Service was delightful. Our server was a young man who was NOT related to owner, contrary to my prediction, but who was visibly proud of the food he was serving. There's an older gentleman, who apparently was a maitre d' at Topolobampo, who works the front of the house, greeting guests and making sure each table is set \"just so.\" He's a delight.The restaurant is BYOB, and there's a liquor store across the street who's waiting for you!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 12, 10]}, "15": {"description": "Ixcateco Grill, I dig you.Albany Park's newest restaurant, I put a bet in that they would handle a dinner party of 9 and the bet paid off! \u00a0Coming in at 8 o'clock it took a little bit of time for them to get the tables together, but the wait was not too bad. \u00a0It was refreshing to see the place bustling with lots of people enjoying food and drink and it was loud.Once seated we cracked open our bottles of beers and wine, and got our menus and water. \u00a0The menu is simple - ten dishes and that's it! \u00a0The simplicity of the menu should make for consistent eats and we got our chips and salsa right away. \u00a0The chips were fresh and had a nice citrus note to them and the green salsa was tasty.We went with about two over every appetizer and three of the guacamole. \u00a0Here is a breakdown of the eats:Guacamole - On point, could spend all day eating this there is a great texture to this guacamole that gives a pleasant mouth feel. \u00a0Grab some more chips because this guac is awesome.Ceviche - Tilapia cerviche hit the spot and we probably should have ordered some more. \u00a0The composition of the dish made it pleasant in your mouth with fresh flavor that leaves you yearning for more. \u00a0The portion size could be bigger but it makes up with lots of taste.Ensalada - This dish wholly surprised me because I actually thought it was going to be the worst of the appetizers we ordered. \u00a0In retrospect, this salad was actually the best of it because of the goat cheese and nuts. \u00a0The agave ginger dressing just took this salad to the next level and I surprisingly took more than I was planning to!Picadita - The roasted chicken here really stands out as you take a bite of it. \u00a0This dish comes in two picaditas so you'll get your fill. \u00a0The Masa canoe had a good snap to it when cut, but again the roasted chicken really stands out in this dish.I was really tempted to get the chicken in black mole but decided to go with the Carne Asada instead. \u00a0I ordered a side of chunky garlic mashed potato as a side dish and this comfort food was exactly what I needed \u00a0The steak was tender, moist with the wood grilled flavor that carried the dish.Overall I would say the food was terrific at a good value. \u00a0The only thing that could have been improved would be the service but I understand given the size of the group I was with. \u00a0Some friends wanted more drinks, and some friends could not handle waiting but they weren't drinking.Oh yes, BYOB - so make sure you bring some of your favorite wine or beer to pass the time, dinner will be fantastic.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 8, 16]}, "57": {"description": "This place is hands down amazing. \u00a0It's 5 star affordable dining...

The fried rice with the wonton soup: my family's classic combo. I guarantee that you will be satisfied with this combo.

Unfortunately the rest of the dish was missing any flavor at all. The meat was chewy and bland, the sauce was nothingness thickened with cornstarch, and the bok choy (one of my favorite vegetables) was just there, doing nothing exciting at all.Pickled radish and kimchi came with the meal, which made me happy. That was probably my favorite part.On the plus side, the service was very friendly and on point. No complaints there. They were so nice, in fact, I feel a little guilty for writing this review.Personally, I liked the decor, as it was reminiscent of a 1990s Chinese restaurant. Some might find the interior a bit dated (and showing its age with stains and dust). I also really like the name: VIP Restaurant, awe yeah!

However, the noodles tasted like they had been cooked about 2 hours earlier. And, while I appreciate them being served seperately to maintain a better overall consistency. It was kind of gross to look at them standing alone. But, once mixed with the mild, sweet black bean sauce, all was forgiven. It was a really exceptional dish. And, I would go back and order it again and again. I also, not sure if this is appropriate or not, mixed the kimchi they provided me, into the dish. I liked how the pickled turnip gave a nice crunch to the softness of the noodles. That's probably not the traditional way to enjoy the dish though.The egg rolls were good. They were fresh. You could tell they are made on site. But, they just weren't my kind of egg rolls. These were a pork based egg roll that were really heavy on the pork. For some that's a good thing. For me, I like an egg roll that's equal parts cabbage, bean sprouts and chopped bbq pork. This was more of a ground pork. And I found them kind of small. They were actually a good size for an appetizer. I just look for an egg roll to be monstrous, almost chipotle size. These were not. But, still I thought, a good value.

I think that dish, along with jjambong has gone downhill for all Chinese/Korean restaurants. I was told a few days later that the dried fish jjajangmyun is good here. I didn't like the jjambong very much. They had overdone the noodles so the starch mixed in with the broth a bit and made it a little more glutinous and the broth was not that spicy either.

As a huge fan of sweet and salty combination, I tend to favor that flavor. But after hitting VIP for their wings, I think I prefer those?? It's a toss-up. The wings are still crispy, spicy, and a touch sweet. The balance is great. The wings are juicy. I would walk over my own mother to have one right now. I digress...I also sampled their Seafood Black Bean noodle (Saam Sun Cha Chiang Mein) dish, which was good, but inferior to Great Sea's version. There was evidence of calamari in the sauce, but it was lacking the gigantic shrimp you find at Great Sea's noodles. We also had the Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu) which was decent, but again inferior to Great Sea's version. We also had the tan soo yuk (sweet and sour beef), which was a lot like how my mom used to make it. There were a sweet sauce drizzled on it, with a saltier dipping sauce on the side. It was good, but nothing too remarkable. All in all a good meal.

The staff and patrons I spoke with filled the room with generosity and warmth. Everyone was helpful toward making menu and drink suggestions. And, even though I was alone, I quickly felt included in every one's conversations and celebrations.Many diners were eating seafood, but I opted for the Churrasco Guatemalteco. It was a fantastic steak. The best I've had in our neighborhood. The cut was of really good quality, expertly seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. I regret not starting with Ceviche. Everyone was eating it. It looked amazing and fresh. Next time it will be mine!In a way, I felt a little like I was on vacation. Sipping on Famosa beer, the official Lager of Guatemala, I would at times get lost in the thumping latin beats provided by their in house DJ. For some, it might be a little loud. But, I kind of liked the vibe they were trying to create. They mentioned that Thursdays is Karaoke and they have a full catalog of Latin and English songs. The weekends are centered around latin dancing with music provided by a DJ. In May they're hosting a famous Guatemalan rock band called Viento en Contra for two shows. This piqued my interest a bit, and I politely asked if the DJ had any of their music. They quickly changed the song for me. And again, I was turned onto something new and enjoyable. The songs were a lot slower than I expected. But you could hear the emotion in the melody and singing. Even though I didn't understand any of the words, I could sense the heartbreak and longing, or proclamations of love being sung.Thank you Tortuga's for such a welcoming experience. I hope other gringos, like myself, take a chance.

We get a dirty look from this younger employee who walks over, cracks the door open and says \"We're not open.\" So, we both say, \"Hey. We were told you would accept customers till 7:30 P.M. We're 2 hours before that.\"The employee curtly asked what we wanted. My friend said she wanted a full set. We were hoping this would let us get in since it would be worth it for the place, financially speaking. Nope. Even after that, the employee said no. My friend asked for the manager, but was told there is no manager. As we were walking away, my friend told the employee that she would call the better business bureau on the nail shop. The employee laughed at us and then turned off that neon sign.So, don't go here if you want your nails done by polite professionals. They don't have any. I hope they enjoy working on their own nails.

The Kabuli Pulao (brown rice with carrots & raisins over a lamb shank) was OK -- the lamb was falling off the bone, the rice was pleasant -- but the lamb was a bit dry and the dish lacked the bright flavors we'd hoped for.

From 3-5 you can find a seat, but they might be out of the beef and tripe stew with peanut sauce and that would be a shame, or running short of my very favorite: the fatty pork spareribs balanced perfectly with sour tamarind broth, green beans and potatoes. They won't be out of crispy pork belly, though, and you can always comfort yourself with that thought. Crispy chiccharon-like skin; tender fatty meat, served with a vinegar based sauce or a weirdly generically named \"all purpose sauce,\" that really gets the job done.If you want to simply choose \"ulams\" or single dishes from the buffet -- and the two I named are solid winners but so is everything else I've tried here -- with rice to go, that will set you back just 5.45 to try two.

Absolutely my favorite thing I had. Came with a huge heaping portion of garlic rice, two eggs and a good portion of tocino (sweetened cured pork). Usually this dish is served with sunnyside up eggs but at Ruby's they do fried eggs. I'm down with it. Seriously so good, I could eat this meal everyday. Tapsilog $5.75 - Same as above except substitute the tocino with tapa (dried meat). Honestly I preferred the tocino but still a very solid meal. My friend liked his tapsilog better than my tocilog so to each their own!Lumpia $4.45 for 12 pieces - Every Asian culture seems to have their own take on what we think of as an eggroll and lumpia is just that for Filipinos. At Ruby's they serve Lumpia Shanghai which are thin, long rolls filled with meat, some random veggies & spices, deep fried to make one strip of goodness. They come with sauce for dipping. Yum!Prices are insanely reasonable and considering how big the portions are, super cheap! Amazing value and even better food. I hate to do comparisons but Ruby's is WAY better than Uncle Mike's. It's replacing UM's on my list of go-to Flip breakfast joints. I want it right now...AHHHH!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 14]}, "28": {"description": "Pretty decent authentic Filipino food.

I crave Noodle Party like a fat girl craves cake. And I'm fat so I know about cake cravings baby.2. Cheap and tasty dinners with portions that are neither tiny nor mountainous like some places, that try to disguise their food's crappiness by giving you so much that you feel bad about complaining.3. Cheap(er) and filling lunch specials.4. Appetizers that actually tease the appetite with flavor instead of drowning it in a sea of oil and salty sadness.5. Consistent quality of food, flavors, and spicy level variable by request. When I have a cold, I beg the owner to spice my Panang curry to the max so I can burn my sinuses into functionality.6. Friendly and humorous owner.7. Ample seating.8. Colorful fish tank and its army of ever-bickering, always-breeding guppies.9. Near my house!The cons:1. Delivery takes forever and a day. (1-2 hours at times!)2. Ordering lunch specials to be delivered leaves room for substitution on the part of the order-taker. We've gotten some interesting interpretations of what we ordered. Deliciousness still trumps goofy food combos.3.

Go here for the Pita bread, it's the best in the city. Verily, all the Middle Eastern groceries and restaurants in town serve THIS bread (albeit at a markup!). It's that good.

Honestly, I think the bread they make here is better than anything I've had \"over there\", and I ate a LOT of that stuff \"over there!\" Giant selection of sweets, cookies, baklava - all made here.Awhile back, they got a new bread oven that is out in the middle of the bakery. It's so cute to see all the kids gathered around, mesmerized, watching the guy take fresh Zatar bread out of the oven. Zatar bread - it's the stuff in the plastic bags that has spices, meat (lamb) or cheese on it. Especially good the day it's baked, but you can also do the ol' \"third world\" method of warming it up by throwing it on an open gas burner (ditto for the pita bread). Drizzle a little olive oil on it, and wallah - lazeez!! (delicious!)The guys who own the store are Lebanese, I believe - and they are the greatest. The Lebanese, along with the Syrians *really* know good food, in my experience. Syrians are like Italians who speak Arabic. Lebanese would be like Frenchmen who speak Arabic (and French). So, if you're unsure about what something is, just ask one of the guys, you'll have your own personal shopper in a minute!The olives and feta cheese in the deli cases here is WAY cheaper (like dollars per pound cheaper) than Dominick's and the large corporate chains.

That was as far as they could come down from $150, which they tried to justify because \"its new, the plastic is still on it.\" This pricing was not inclusive of shipping or tax. I later found a brand new, unused one was at a major appliance store for $175. \u00a0A used, newer model of the same brand and color was on craigslist for $75. Moral of the story: do your research before entering the store and shop around to avoid buyer's remorse. An easy thing to say now in hindsight, but then I was just trying to save some time and money, which did not happen.They were shrewd in placing the microwave way up top on the shelf so I could could not inspect the condition of the item. Upon delivery, the side of the appliance that was facing the wall had a huge dent, and the top of the unit was all scratched up with evidence of rust. \"New\" my ass, I'm pretty sure they just put a film on it. I would be less upset had the microwave been cheaper.No consistency in communication and complete lack or organization. When I inquired about shipping the lady at the store quoted me one price and the salesman quoted me a different higher price.

What, because they don't provide towels?The thing about the Elston location that I don't think some people can appreciate is that it's not a health club culture; it's a gym culture. I'd say about 90% of the people who train there are there to train hard, push heavy weight, and make friends with others training just as hard (the women train just as hard, if not harder).It's a great gym for seasoned lifters, professional lifters, beginners, and those in between.(Also, the first 12 pictures are not of the Elston location).Pros:+ gym culture (no glam health club sparkles, no purple and pink). Also, if you ask to work in, they understand what you mean and will usually welcome you to work in.+ Iron plates (plates are not covered with rubber, so no wondering if their weight includes the rubber or not)+ Staff is friendly and helpful: girls at the front will always say hello, most often goodbye, and sometimes small talk in between); + staff is helpful: I'd mentioned that I'm having trouble finding a whey protein powder without artificial sweeteners. So a couple of the guys are keeping their eyes open for one (they thought they'd found one for a moment, but research showed otherwise. So they're still looking).+ Chalk is welcome, just don't make a mess.+ Trainers are certified and actually know what they're doing/talking about.+ Wear what you want. (My friends and I just wear jeans and gym shoes-we don't even use the locker room).+ There's a sort of family/fellowship culture there. You meet people, they remember you later, gain friends, notice when you haven't shown up in a while, give/get tips for better form/ lifting / results, etc.+ good variety and selection of machines, both upstairs and downstairs.+ 5 or 6 benches+ 2 sets of dumbbells (or 4 of each weight)+ treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes, stairs, etc.+ smoothie bar and sitting area+ small store area (staff also have good knowledge of products sold)+ protein drinks, protein bars, etc. kept cold+ classes upstairs+ heavy bags and speed bags upstairs+ since Elston is not a \"full-service\" gym, you can get good deals to only go there (versus paying an arm and a leg for them all, like when you sign up at Niles).+ once you sign up, you're locked into that contract for life, as long as you continue to renew each year.

Even though clearly they are filled to capacity, they are still giving \"tours\" to prospective members.What would usually be an hour to complete my workout becomes more like an hour and a half because I have to wait to use a machine because there are 5 people ahead of me waiting to use the machine. I was a member for a long long time because they were so close to home and affordable but now I'd rather go a bit out of my way and pay a bit more...but at least know that the gym is not going to be overflowing with people.

I was practically dragged by the hand into the tanning salon booth to tour it even though I emphatically stated I won't be using the tanning rooms at all. Then after the tour I was shown a chair and they started with the numbers games where they talk really, really fast and write down lots of numbers and figures then cross out numbers and present multiple options all at once in a deliberate effort to purposely confuse the (future) (would-be) client. In te end I should have just stood up and walked away but I had the sense if I did stand up and walk away they would follow me to my home in their car - that's how pushy those 2 guys were. They kept telling me I don't know how to lift weights and I must have a trainer that will take me to new levels, etc. I explained that I had worked with trainers int he past and simply wanted to sing up for a month-to-month membership and they kept pushing and pushing and going over multiple options, on and on. In the end I signed up for some membership and called the corporate headquarters to cancel the next day. It was the only way to make those 2 guys stop. After the tour and the extended time trying to sell me training sessions I didn't want I had to leave and go home and change for work.

He drew up the contract, which I signed without looking at (this later came back to haunt me). After 2 sessions with Lee, during which he was always distracted, constantly walking away to do other things, and would end our sessions in 45 minutes (instead of an hour, which is what I paid for), he finally texted me AN HOUR before our third session to tell me that he was unable to continue with our training and that I would have to find another trainer.

I used to go to the one out in Arlington Heights because it was convenient for work. The staff seemed to have an air of elitism, and were determined to up-sell as much as they could, whether on personal training sessions (to the tune of thousands of dollars, potentially), tanning beds (which is totally cheesy IMO) and the vast array of mid-grade supplements offered in the little \"store\" they have. I realize this is par for the course for most gyms, but I personally don't appreciate the assumption that I know nothing about health & fitness, and that the only way to stay in shape was to spend all kinds of money on a trainer, along with hundreds of dollars on a heart rate monitor, and a significant monthly expenditure \u00a0on various ingestibles (powders, bars, gels, etc.) designed to enhance my workout results. I did actually purchase a large container of an expensive protein mix that I was supposed to take 3 times daily, which was impossible because all it did was make me feel incredibly full, bloated, and constipated. The clientele consisted primarily of people looking to hook up (even at 8 in the morning!), giving the place the feeling of a nightclub or some other social setting instead of a place to work out. This vibe is greatly enhanced by the terrible House music pumped loudly over the speakers 24-7.I now go to the one on N. Elston in Chicago since it's literally a mile from where I live. When I went in to switch my membership so as to make that my primary location, they couldn't do it unless I paid the next higher tier fee each month. It was only about 7 dollars more than I'd already been paying, but I got the feeling the guy was just being lazy, and that it was easier just to charge me more than to actually switch my membership over. Same deal with the clientele & the terribly cheesy club music, but somehow the members seem to be even less considerate of the fact that other people besides themselves use the facility. Apparently, no one can be bothered to put the weights back where they belong after using them, nor can they do so with medicine balls, workout mats, or anything that can be picked up & moved. \u00a0Seriously, it's like a joke. I'm not sure if it's some sort of self-entitlement thing (like \"I pay to come here, so I shouldn't have to clean up after myself, ergo someone should do it for me\"), or perhaps just plain ignorance, but it's aggravating nonetheless. There are a few individuals who find it necessary to completely monopolize entire stations for the duration of their visit. This wouldn't be quite so annoying if they were actually USING the equipment for its intended purpose as opposed to using it as their own personal clothing rack/magazine display, and spending half their time walking around talking to other people instead of working out. There are 15 large flatscreen TVs in the weight room, 10 of which are programmed with pretty much the same content (5 on the XSport advertising \"channel\", 5 on some awful music video network that is also roughly half commercials for the club itself), and the remaining 5 are divided among various brands of intelligence-insulting crap. Granted, I typically go during the late morning/early afternoon when most of the programming is aimed at the Lowest Common Denominator, but surely there are other more interesting selections to offer. Nickelodeon should NEVER be one of those options!One other thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the complete unwillingness of the staff to help me figure out a way to temporarily modify my membership status over this past Summer. \u00a0The kind of work I'm doing these days requires very long hours after which I am simply too exhausted to go workout. \u00a0During a labor-intensive project of this nature, I usually only end up making it to the gym one day a week. So I inquired as to whether or not it would be possible to adjust the parameters of my membership so as not to continue paying the full amount each month for a facility I would not be using as often. They looked at me like I had 3 heads. Not only did the first couple people I tried to speak with appear as though they couldn't comprehend what I was asking, the person \"in charge\" that day didn't even offer any suggestions. He recommended I \"call the corporate office\" but warned me not to get my expectations up. Wow, such tremendous customer service! \u00a0This is the kind of loyalty & appreciation one can expect after 5 years of monthly dues.Recently, my wife got a job working for Midtown Athletic Clubs.

I'll try this place.\" I mean, even when pizza is bad, it's not *bad*. Or so I thought.Delivery was fast. I'll give Marie's that. But then the delivery guy couldn't figure out how my callbox worked. I feel like a delivery driver should be acquainted with a wide array of different callboxes, and mine isn't exactly rocket science. It's your standard \"scroll through the names and press the button to call\" kind. So when he called me, I explained to him how it works---that he had to scroll through the names---and still he kept trying to type my name into the keypad. I'm pretty sure tying shoes is significantly more difficult than using a callbox, and I'm quite confident this gentleman was wearing shoes, so I don't know what the deal was.So I walked downstairs and through the courtyard to the gate to get my pizza, came back upstairs and got ready to dig in. Any confidence I had in the intrinsic not-that-badness of pizza is shattered. I'm \u00a0convinced that Marie's must have a massive underground marketing ring that pays people to post positive Yelp reviews, because that's the only possible explanation for even one five-star review, much less the plethora I've found here. I can't believe that people either enjoy food this disgusting or are malicious enough to lead others astray with such positive reviews. Nobody is *that* terrible a person.I like to get bacon on my pizza. So that's what I got. Imagine you had a slab of bacon, 4-5 slices thick. Then you chop through the slab, but didn't separate the slices, and throw the chunks on the pizza. That's what I think they did, so instead of crispy-tender salty goodness, I got chewy soft cubes of half-cooked fat that left my mouth coated in slime and a greasy pork chop aftertaste. It was hands down not only the worst pizza I've ever had, but probably the worst delivery meal I've ever had.It was so terrible, I wish I had a gag reflex so I could throw it up. Maybe I'll go drink some Strawberry Essence Suave shampoo and hope that does the trick. Or if anyone knows where I can pick up a good stomach flu, let me know. I'm all ears.

Ask for fresh tomato and for it to be well done, and the sausage is very good. Unfortunately there is little consistency- in the the dough thickness, in the amount of sauce or ingredients put on, etc. so it's a crapshoot but the flavor and the crust are so good.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The hate part is the management or lack thereof. Even when I was a THREE TIMES A WEEK REGULAR CUSTOMER, if I had a problem with my order, then they had a problem with ME. I can't tell you how many times I heard from them \"there is no manager\" so they wouldn't fix the problem or give me a credit. They often forgot to double dough the pizza so what would come all greasy and sloppy and mushy and their answer was \"ok next time you order we won't charge you for double dough\" SERIOUSLY? You sent me the wrong pizza and you're not going to fix it?

However, the food was far from stellar, and I say this with the utmost respect in hopes they will improve.My boyfriend and I visited last night for the ramen. We asked the noodles to be cooked more al dente since other friends who visited said the noodles were over done (ramen should be chewy). The noodles came out right but the broth was just warm and the pork slices and egg were actually cold. I understand they cook the pork in advance and slice to go, but they need to make sure the ramen is hot, as the temperature of the stock is very essential to the ramen eating experience (the stock should be just hot enough to require a little blowing and slurping... part of the ramen enjoyment). The sushi was terrible. I can't mince words here, as my boyfriend is a trained sushi chef who has been making sushi for 10 years at local sushi restaurant with a Japanese executive chef. The rice is the most important aspect of sushi. Each grain should be separated from the next and be chewy and lightly sticky. The rice in the sushi we had was compressed together, glue like, with no separation of the grains of rice. I'd compare this experience to the difference between Parisian French bread and sliced white bread. The former has texture and is delicious by itself. The second is not comparable as a stand alone ingredient (though I'm partial to PB&J sandwiches made with sliced white bread). For people who don't know good sushi, it's a shame they are served substandard sushi rice, most likely reused from the day before (you never ever reuse sushi rice. It should be made fresh each day). Aside from the rice, the fish was not fresh.However, the waitress who worked there was very friendly, and filled our green tea automatically. They also have decent tako yaki (caramelized octopus dough balls). I think they need to hire a new sushi chef. The ramen is ok as long as you ask for the noodle to be more undercooked and the broth to be piping hot. *And get the garlic broth - it is better than the regular tonkatsu broth.Info on proper sushi rice: web-japan.org/nipponia/n\u2026", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 11, 24]}, "34": {"description": "Good food but nothing extra ordinary.

The sushi is borderline awful. I eat a lot of sushi and been all over the city and this was grocery store quality. As someone mentioned below it's on par with Jewel sushi. I thought that was harsh based on other reviews until I ate the sushi. I did carry out, and walked the 5 minutes home. We ordered a lot, and could barely finish half. I hate to be a downer and I know business owners put a lot of heart and soul in the food, but good sushi really has two main things to focus on: taste and quality of the rice and the quality and taste of the fish. Both were severely lacking. The rice was mushy and flavorless. The fish was poor quality and tasted as such. The ingredients used in the rolls besides the fish tasted stale and offered nothing but to make the rolls more off-putting. I might give this place one more shot and am curious about the Ramen, but disappointed that a place so close to home was not a hit in my house.Also, on another note, and applicable to Wabi Sabi, I'm so tired of seeing 90% of rolls on a menu cater to the taste of American eaters (being an American myself): everything contains something tempura, or cream cheese, drenched in sauce, etc. Some rolls I get, but there's got to be some creativity without all the crazy flavors...I've seen other places do it.

Upon arriving, we sadly learned they're closed on Wednesdays apparently, but I had just caught glance of a good looking sushi place next door. We walked back, checked out the menu, and it didn't initially seem like they had a lot of vegetarian options (hint hint, we're vegetarians), but it seemed legit, I figured let's try it out.So, we went in, the actual menu inside had a good sized vegetarian menu, and we LOADED UP.Sesame salad, ginger salad, vegetable tempura, avocado roll, sweet potato roll, the crunchy vegetable roll, and the tempura ice cream desert.Oh my god. The servings for the sushi were just right, for the tempura as well, and the largest salad serving I've gotten at a sushi place. We were stuffed before we even got desert. Our favorite was the sweet potato roll hands out, it came out looking like a speciality roll even though that was our crunchy vegetable, which was also delicious (avocado was good, but the other two were beyond comparison for it). We were in surprise heaven knowing its in walking distance for the price. Considering we gorged ourselves and ordered more food than we usually did, we only came out to little more than forty bucks. We could've easily subtracted desert and another roll to bring it down to little more than thirty bucks. It was great.This is the first place in awhile that I walked into without looking at yelp, I don't know how long they've been around, but they deserve the neighborhood's business. It is nice to know we have a great priced sushi restaurant in walking distance, with quick service and a nice atmosphere.

The sushi is borderline awful. I eat a lot of sushi and been all over the city and this was grocery store quality. As someone mentioned below it's on par with Jewel sushi. I thought that was harsh based on other reviews until I ate the sushi. I did carry out, and walked the 5 minutes home. We ordered a lot, and could barely finish half. I hate to be a downer and I know business owners put a lot of heart and soul in the food, but good sushi really has two main things to focus on: taste and quality of the rice and the quality and taste of the fish. Both were severely lacking. The rice was mushy and flavorless. The fish was poor quality and tasted as such. The ingredients used in the rolls besides the fish tasted stale and offered nothing but to make the rolls more off-putting. I might give this place one more shot and am curious about the Ramen, but disappointed that a place so close to home was not a hit in my house.Also, on another note, and applicable to Wabi Sabi, I'm so tired of seeing 90% of rolls on a menu cater to the taste of American eaters (being an American myself): everything contains something tempura, or cream cheese, drenched in sauce, etc. Some rolls I get, but there's got to be some creativity without all the crazy flavors...I've seen other places do it.

I dragged my flu stricken body, in attempt to get the taste of that chicken soup my mom used to make when I was sick. Granted, I never liked this thing that much--c'mon it's like a clear chicken broth soup with lots of garlic, dates, ginseng... And something that I always ate when I had no appetite.

Anyhow, this soup pops in my head when I'm sick. And I'm pretty sure this is the only Korean restaurant that serves this. It came out boiling hot in the ddook bae gi (the stone pot), with the small whole chicken. The broth was rich, and the meat fell off the bone effortlessly. I think it was possibly better than my mothers (sorry mom). Also this is how our family ate the soup; eat the 2/3 of the chicken meat as you dip it lightly on salt and pepper mix, take the rest of the meat apart from the bones, mix well with the sweet rice, and eat it like jook (porridge). But my mom put more sweet rice than they did here, but no worries, she didn't prepare a separate bowl of rice. In other words, it's plenty of food. And yes, be careful of the little bones. It's annoying but I take my time to take off all the bones so the rest of my eating experience is uninterrupted.The banchans included leek cucumber kimchi (o-ee so-bak-ee), regular kimchi, radish kimchi (kkak doo gi), picked garlic, anchovies with pepper, and tossed bellflower (do-rah-ji moo-cheem).

The broth is extremely savory but clean. The part where it tastes so clean is the real shocker for me, because once chilled the soup turns into a big gelatinous blob which speaks to how long the bones must have sat in the broth to give up all their flavor. Also love how soft the chicken bones are, this means they have fulfilled their marrow-giving destinies to the fullest.Just a heads up, if you've never had samgaetang before I would imagine the first time is going to be just slightly disappointing. It's my hunch that samgaetang is an acquired taste that you grow up with, although I would love to be proven wrong. The chicken soup is meant to be seasoned to taste, which is why they give you that tiny little dish full of salt. Another preferred method for Koreans is to shred your chicken and dip pieces into the salt before they head towards your mouth. Then scoop up a spoonful of brothy rice, place a big blob of kimchi (my fave is the radish kimchi) on top \u00a0and voila - a perfectly seasoned bite. The more green onions the better. I also like a healthy dash of pepper. Honorable mention dishes: Dakbokkumtang (or is it Dak-doritang here? They're the same thing). Spicy, sweet, and extremely generous portions. I packed it to go and seriously fed myself for a week. Also have to mention the adorable little old lady who served us. She is extremely hospitable, which is sort of an atypical thing for authentic Korean restaurants.P.S. Take the broth home for some excellent congee (or what the Koreans call juk) the next morning. Remove all chicken bones, and add rice at home and boil till rice is done. I could eat 10 bowls in one sitting.

It set me back about $30. The Banatski was larger than the other bottles and it was still under $12. I'm a fan of these cheap E.

If that wasn't enough, I know for a fact there were at least two more that I'm forgetting. So Maria F. wasn't kidding; they have \"a good selection of Eastern European wines.\"I ended up with a huge bottle of the Banatski, my 2007 Hercegovacki Vranac and the Serbian Medvedja Krv. It set me back about $30. The Banatski was larger than the other bottles and it was still under $12. I'm a fan of these cheap E.

We got what we normally get at Mexican places- tacos. We got Picadillo (ground beef), chicken, chorizo, steak, Korean beef and Bulgogi tacos as well as rice and beans. Everything was phenomenal. I was surprised at how good tacos with Korean style meat tasted. Every one must try. Even the authentic Mexican tacos were good. The meats were spiced to perfection. At some places, the meats are just grilled with no additional spices. Here, I could taste some smoky and fragrant spices in the meat. The spices were subtle and not the kind that made the food \"spicy hot\". We also got two bottles of sauce- green and red sauce . They were tasty and we used it to make our tacos as spicy as we wanted it. I know they also get fresh bread. There is a Mexican bakery next door and I saw the bakery delivering the bread. Cost: Cheap and very Affordable . Regular Mexican tacos are $1.90. The Korean Tacos are around $2. They have tons of other options that cost similar to or cheaper than hole in the wall taco places in Pilsen or other Mexican neighborhoods.

The pot stickers were really delicious and I honestly could have eaten an entire order by myself. The pad Thai was also excellent. Good sized portion with plenty of chicken and sauce. The price for our order was really great too - under $22 total.I've only tried one other Thai place in the area (Hot Woks) and I think Ruk is leaps and bounds better.

Spacious, plenty of parking, friendly service, affordable-- yes, it is cheaper than buying groceries and making dinner-- definitely BYOB, close to the brown line, and, oh, the food.That green salsa. Oh man. I cannot say enough amazing things about that green salsa. I've never encountered it anywhere else and beg the staff for extra containers every time I carry out... or dine in and, inevitably, am laden with piles of leftovers. Creamy, bright green, mild, and a little tangy, this salsa is the condiment of my dreams. From what I can tell (or wheedle out of the proprietors), it's an avocado-based salsa verde. The buttery avocado smooths out the vinegary spiciness of the peppers but still retains a pleasant kick. As far as meat, San Juanito's al pastor is the way to go. Slightly sweet, fatty enough to stay moist, and flecked with bits of caramelized onion, order it topped with cilantro and raw onion. Their chorizo, my Mexican food staple, is also great and a little unusual compared to other renditions I've tasted. Crumbly and spicy, it has a slightly sweet, cinnamony undertone to all the usual savoriness.For vegetarians, San Juanito's offers a chile relleno taco. I don't think the textures jive perfectly but it's definitely something I haven't seen many other places.

I think it is always a good sign when you see the boys in blue at an establishment, they usually know where the good eats are. I went for the al pastor tacos. I thought they were tasty, not the best in the city but still pretty solid. Skip the beans & rice...they are nothing special. As with most taquerias, you are greeted with a basket of chips & salsa but at TSJ they provide you with a trio of salsa! You get your basic mild salsa, a smokey red salsa and a creamy green salsa which is quite delicious. It's an avocado based \"salsa\" and I will be asking for extra upon my next visit. TSJ is totally affordable. They have various specials including 20 tacos for $30...something to keep in mind for my next fiesta!

Luckily, it was Sunday, \u00a0so I had no trouble parking on the street (for free, yay!!!), but for what it cost in gas I could have gotten a great meal from any number of South side Mexican restaurants. \u00a0That being said, it was average. I had guacomole to start. It was pretty much just mashed avocado. \u00a0No onion, lime, garlic...kinda bland except for the salt I put on. Chicago's Best featured a \"Super Torta\" called a Cubano. It sounded interesting, but I didn't want hot dogs on my torta. I settled on a Michoacana, which is Carne asada, ham, chorizo, beans, lettuce, tomato and sour cream on a toasted super size torta bun. Large size for sure. The asada was chopped into tiny pieces, as the chorizo is, and the tomatoes too. That caused alot to fall out as I picked it up. The chorizo was borderline burnt, but had flavor. The couple of pieces of ham were very thin and looked more like bologna..couldn't even taste it. The beans I noticed only on one side of the bun. I guess overall it was just \"ok\". Larger slices of Carne asada would make it easier to eat, but I wouldn't make the drive that far to go here again.The staff was buzzing around, very helpful and friendly.

The drink was terrific, smooth, alcoholic, served with an orange peel and a single large ice cube that melts slowly and mellows the drink as you sip. Quite perfect. Then on to the wine selection, a sauvignon blanc from somewhere, I forget, but it was credible. You can order most wines by the glass in 3 oz. or 6 oz. servings, with prices to match.

But I think it was time after 3 years of going to Salon Blonde I needed a change and it was getting too expensive.  So I read Stella's review and thought why not.  So far so good, I am yet to actually wash my hair and style it myself. That is my ultimate test cause with 2 kids I have no time to stand in front of a mirror with a whole bunch of hair tools.  The salon itself is ok , nothing fab. But Goca is very nice, and she seems to know hair. She is helpful when it comes to your cut.  \u00a0After about 2 minutes I felt like she was one of my friends as we talked about everything, it was a comfortable experience.

I needed and emergency bang trim as my normal hair girl was not available and she took me even though I didn't have an appointment. I just have to say that it took her maybe 5-10 minutes to trim my bangs and she did an amazing job since I am so picky about my bangs and she even understood how my bangs work..so as I was leaving I went to pay and she didn't even charge me but I still gave her money for her trouble and taking me on such a short notice.

OMG! Her hair was so cute so I went to see \"the goca\" as a friend of mine fondly referred to her. First of all, can I just say that \"the goca\" is too cute?!! She is. This is important to me when finding a new stylist, they have to be cute and have good style which she definately does. The salon is cute, has hip decor, and it's yellow! She uses Matrix and Rusk products so my hair smells purty now, I need to get this shampoo for real. She brightened up my color and took the bulk out of my hair - and gave me some cute bangs as well. Also, she's far more reasonable pricewise then the salons I've been frequenting lately. At least I won't have to sell my first born to get a highlight and cut anymore...and the price I was quoted was the price I was charged - which is refreshing. For real.

But no matter what they did my hair was either too brassy or too green when they'd try to steer away from gold. On top of it my hair was always damaged. Someone introduced me to goca and she did on my hair whatever I'd been asking for years and never got in other places. My hair is not damaged and is the perfect natural shade with highlights that have no brass whatsoever. The reason why i went to her is cuz my friend gets highlights done by her and she goes really light and her base is dark which i was told it causes for your hair to pull a lot of gold, but my friend has amazing creamy color and she has long hair which is \u00a0something i couldnt have at that shade since my hair would break as a result of other places using cheap products.
