My brow tint is always the perfect tone for my hair and skin and the girls always make sure to never get wax or tweeze happy, which is a pet peeve of mine. I typically have Nadia do my brows as she's always done them, and it's a learning experience along the way. I, like most, have one good and one bad brow, so she teaches me what to do to make them look identical as possible and even shows me techniques for filling them in. I never feel rushed and really feel like she adds the personal touch that so many girls look for in a beauty experience. Super professional and love how sweet she is -- and most importantly, I can tell she knows what she is talking about and listens to what I want.

I am indian and have had my eyebrows threaded since I was 13 years old. I have been EVERYWHERE in Atlanta, DC, NY, MD, VA and have always been able to find a place that knows how to do good threading. However, when I moved to Chicago it was impossible. I tried Devon, and a bunch of threading places in Chicago for the past SIX years and have never been satisfied by their threading job. I have usually been the complete opposite of satisfied, and even more annoyed when they tell me it's \"just the way my eyebrows are.\" In any case, after reading the reviews online about Nadia, I decided to give waxing a try. She is everything they say and more. Truly. Not only does she listen to you (she even agreed to look at a photo of my old eyebrows and didn't make me feel crazy), but she explains what she is doing and is HONEST regarding what can and can't be fixed about your eyebrows in one session. She has an eye for the perfect arch and will even fill in your eyebrows before you leave if you would like her to. I don't know if I am sold on waxing yet, but I am definitely sold on Nadia. It's such a relief to know that I have finally found my eyebrow place. After my first appointment with her, my girlfriends actually NOTICED my eyebrows and insisted that they wanted to see her as well since she was able to work wonders with my botched eyebrows. Appointments are easy to make online which is really nice. Parking is next to impossible which is the only downside, but she's totally worth the hassle. Also, if you are used to threading prices, her prices are a bit higher ($20 for eyebrows), but again, totally worth it. Her suite is super cute and she has always been on time every time I have seen her. She's also very sweet and easy to talk to :)I highly recommend Nadia.

After all of the great reviews, I wanted to book an appointment to get my eyebrows done properly before my upcoming relocation to a smaller city. Since the Yelp online booking link didn't work, I tried calling...and calling. The first time, I left a message. The next time, the mailbox was full, but my (2nd) missed call which should've registered and been returned. A couple of days later, I called a different number that reached another suite and was advised to call her assistant, Lena and was given her number. I left a voice message with Lena and she called me back the next day. I explained that I wanted to set an appointment with Nadia and was booked. Woohoo finally! I hoped my brows would be worth the hassle of simply making an appointment.No such luck. After a 20 minute drive to get there and paying for parking, I was greeted by Lena who was working on a client. She introduced herself and told me she would get to me shortly. Wait what? Where is Nadia??? A few minutes later Nadia walks in. I was about to sit in her chair when she realized I was not her scheduled client. We had an awkward exchange (in front of Lena and her client) in which she apologized for the inconvenience, blamed the mixup on likely poor reception in the suite, and told me Lena would be able to do the same job she would. The client being worked on felt the need to cosign. This was not the point. I don't doubt that Lena would've done a nice job, but I came in after having read reviews specifically for Nadia...and at $30, it doesn't come cheap. Since she is from whom I requested the service, I believe I should've received it, rather than be asked to accept an alternative. I think that a better solution could've been proposed that wouldn't have come at my time and experience expense, and it wasn't. So I left and went to Benefit's Brow Bar.

It came juicy, but not so much that it couldn't be picked up. It was served with a plastic fork, which I initially took advantage of. The fries are fresh cut with skins,.but a bit too salty for my taste. My lunch compadres also ordered beef sandwiches. Their taste buds desensitized long ago by spicy foods--thought Frannie's hot giardianera was too mild. I have an aversion to spicy foods and thought the beef was flavorful, but not overly spicy. One of my colleagues ordered the triple threat fries, which includes cheddar cheese, sour cream and bacon (imitation) bits. I must confess I'm not much of a beef sandwich kind of a guy.

Potato pancakes \u00a0were actually pretty good, but were not homemade, as you can see from previous pictures they are premade and deep fried.Here's the problem. We sat facing the kitchen. We can see the food \"staging\" area, where they have one person pulling the ready food dishes off of the counter to pass to the server. I watched this guy grab every single plate with his thumb on the bottom and his four fingers on the top of the plates and in the food. The reason for this backwards handling of food is this guy was short and the counter was pretty high. He had to stretch and pull the plates towards him. At the same time this person was wearing a Halloween mask, he kept taking off his mask to scratch his sweaty hair. I asked to speak to the manager thinking she would accept feedback and teach her staff how to properly handle a plate. I was wrong. I could tell she was upset with the feedback. She Makes up some gibberish about health dept. code stating if the person doesn't handle money he is to wash his hands every 30 minutes????? Are you kidding me? So we have 30 minutes worth of sweaty fingers on our plates??? I informed her she was wrong and ended the conversation. She walked away upset.

For residing in a hotel, it surprisingly has a poppin' buzz! When we first walked in, we were enveloped in what I call the Post-Conference Cacophony. It's where people that attend a conference for work finally have some free time and let their hair down or unbutton their collars over some drinks with strangers/ new professional friends. A room can easily fill with the belches of loud fake laughs. Thankfully, with so much seating available, finding a private and quiet table was no problem.Bricketon's staff members rock! Ernie, our server that night, was by far the friendliest and smiliest person we met during our stay in Chicagoland. (Ernie, if you're reading this, please know that you're awesome!) We couldn't ask for anyone better! Unfortunately, the food just did not match up to the atmosphere and service. Really too bad.We started off our meal with some complimentary bread and butter, which neither of us found appetizing. I think the buns were a pretzel bread of some sort, and it just reminded me of ones from a grocery store that were left out too long on the dining room table. But whatever, I looked forward to enjoying the entrees, anyway. My girlfriend ordered the quesadilla ($9), which had a spread of guacamole, diced tomatoes, and sour cream. Even though I was starving, after several bites, I couldn't stomach anymore. As for me, I got the shrimp cocktail ($11), which came with only five measly shrimps and a cocktail sauce. You would think for the price, I would get more than that. In addition, it wasn't even in a cocktail glass, rather in a small jar. That dish was just underwhelming.Luckily, their drinks somewhat salvaged my meal. Thank you whomever made my Moscow Mule ($12).

All this for $19 and change (excluding tip). We placed our order on-line and also used our I-Phone to pay. This place has great technology. We dubitated about ordering from here, but we trusted the fellow Yelp community. My Mongolian chicken was not loaded with sodium, so I was very happy. The Hunan beef was hot (as in spicy heat), but it had enough of a kick without clearing your sinuses. The beef was very flavorful and satisfying. It wasn't rubbery like another Yelper stated, so I don't know WTF she was smoking that day! I was super fain with what I had. Also, the egg roll was not greasy. The exterior was crispy and it didn't taste like it was cooked in stale oil or burnt oil. The interior was loaded with vegetables (no meat of any kind). The ratio of onions and scallions for the Mongolian chicken was the perfect amalgamation. This is not a 5-star \"as good as it gets\" restaurant, but I am definitely a fan for several reasons. The vegetables were fresh and had the right \"bite\" (not overcooked and soggy). I have a sensitivity to sodium. I really do not care for salty foods. A lot of Chinese restaurants that we have eaten at use tons of sodium. I am not a huge fan of Chinese food for this reason. However. this Chinese restaurant seasoned their food in such a way that made it plain delectable. I didn't taste tons of salt. Our dinner also came with a small cup of soup (either Wonton or Egg Drop). We all got the Wonton soup and it was 4-star worthy as was my Mongolian chicken. If we are ever in this area again, for any reason, I would definitely stop in again. We had an enjoyable dinner. We were in the area for an appointment, so we decided to try this place based on some of the Yelp reviews. This restaurant is located on the west side of Cumberland just a tiny bit south of Foster Avenue. It is a few doors away from Dunkin' Donuts, Subway and Elly's Pancake. The parking lot is fairly large and we had no problem finding a spot even though the lot was fairly crowded. The restaurant can use an update. Yes, it \u00a0looks like it has been left back in the early 1990's. However, I appreciated that it is clean, semi-quiet with adequate lighting making it easy to read the menu. As you enter the restaurant, there are several booths to the right of the restaurant, with a very small bar on the left side toward the rear. They do not serve alcoholic drinks here. Instead the bar is used for making smoothies. I suppose you could bring your own wine (BYOW), but we didn't see anyone drinking wine or beer. Whatever!This is a family-owned restaurant. The family members are hard working people who truly care about their customers. Service was hospitable and prompt.

Call me fussy. Call me a food snob. Either way - I found the food to rather mediocre. In fact, I think it fell on the less than mediocre side.I had my first Lin's experience and it totally fell short. I work right down the street and have been avoiding Lin's for quite some time. Despite how coworkers rave about it, I had one bad experience with takeout and I vowed never to return. Or so I thought. Let's start with the food. Yes, the prices for lunch (and dinner) are very reasonable. My guess is because the ingredients they use (particularly the meat) are questionable at best. Lunch options come with your choice of egg drop, wonton, or hot and sour soup. I went for the wonton (filled with pork). It wasn't the greatest thing I've ever eaten, but it wasn't terrible. My coworker opted for the hot and sour soup. We both found it tasted like sweaty gym shoes that had been sitting in a hot locker for 3 days. No exaggeration. There was a horrible pungent odor and taste that neither of us could get past. As for my entr\u00e9e, I ordered Szechwan chicken with steamed rice. I was fine with the sauce and veggies, but couldn't handle the chicken. Let's put it this way, if what I had eaten had been in fact poultry, I would be shocked. I tried my coworker's General Tso's chicken and tasted the same rubbery chicken wrapped in a gargantuan sized blanket of dough and sticky sauce. As for service and ambiance - once again, nothing special. The service was fast and I never had to ask for my water refilled. However, our waitress didn't seem to know what was in half of the dishes.

I have been too busy lately with Midterms, Birthday Party, Finals, work, Anime Central, Flying to Korea, Going to Lollapalooza... Well, I am back! Time to review an epic breakfast I had at Hyatt Regency O'Hare's American Grill.Atmosphere:Management really took the time to make this hotspot within the hotel stand out. Seats were comfortable and plush. Modern furnishings and bold art pieces gave you something to appreciate in your surrounding. Everything was kept clean, and it feels really great to be watched by people passing by wishing they the money to eat the food being served. This atmosphere would also be great for dates. It is not very noisy at all and there is enough space between tables for intimate conversations.Service:The staff was very friendly from the moment the host seated you. Every server and chef was a pleasure to have an exchange with. The omelette chef that morning was especially cheerful when he was making me my delicious omelette. It is also rare to find a staff of waiters so attentive. I could feel them reading my facial expression and body movements whenever I needed something. Glasses were always filled, and butter and other condiments were prompt to appear when requested.Food:I shed a single tear the first time I came for the breakfast buffet for the first time. Never doubt the $18+ buffet, it is worth every penny. There are breakfast items from around the world and many gluten free options. Pita Bread with Hummus, Miso Soup, and all the fresh fruits! The Omelette chef made Omelettes to your exact specification as well. Is this what it feels like to have Breakfast like a god? The ingredient choices for Omelettes were plenty. I had an amazing Omelette with mushrooms and diced tomatoes. But my favorite item was.... The Chicken sausage. Was never a fan of sausage ever until this point in my life. It is a food I can't really compare to anything else. It is Tender, Juicy, and.... Just Good!

Making an appointment was pretty easy - I just sent an email and received a response within hours. They were completely booked on the Saturday I wanted to visit, but I was offered a number of alternative weekdays. I picked a day and time and received a confirmation email the next day.The place is a bit difficult to find - it's on the first floor of a very large apartment complex. It's near the leasing office, by the main entrance, just down from the corporate center.I entered and was greeted pretty quickly. I said I was scheduled for a massage and they asked me to take a seat. No problem - I was early. I looked around, and got a little nervous. The spa/salon wasn't very luxurious. The walls were a pale pink with what seemed to be painted wooden letters spelling out \"SPA\" hanging on the wall. The front part of the salon had a few chairs for haircuts. As you head to the back, you pass the mani/pedi stations. I didn't see where the massage would take place.Right at my appointment time, Galina called me back. She's is the owner and I think the only massage therapist. She told me she offered the groupon to help bring in business, as she knew it was a difficult place to find and attract customers. She told me that she accepted medical insurance for massages, and that if you bought a package, the massages ended up being $45 a piece. She brought me to this tiny room in the back of the salon - it was just big enough for a massage table and a little room on each side to talk around it. She told me to undress, get on the table, and she'd be back.I did as she said and she came back in a few minutes. I was comfortable, and she explained she'd give a regular massage and incorporate hot stones. Sounded good to me. A few minutes into the massage, she asked me to excuse her. She opened the door to the room and told one of her employees something about scheduling, basically that the woman's appointment would be late and she had time to give a manicure. I thought it was weird, since she opened the door as I was laying on the table and anyone in the next room would have been able to see me. I was a bit annoyed, but it was just a quick exchange, and she started the massage again. Only a few minutes later, the same thing happened - she opened the door and told her employees something else. Galina apologized, saying the girl was new, but still, I was a little uncomfortable. The rest of the massage was without incident - it didn't happen again. However, although there was relaxing music playing in the massage room, it didn't block out the sounds from the mani/pedis happening a few feet away. I could hear whole conversation between customers and nail techs, so it took away some of the relaxing element.The massage itself was good. Galina applied a good amount of pressure and really worked on my muscles. The hot stones after the massage of each body part felt really good. The heat really made the massage a lot better. I left feeling relaxed and my muscles felt great.So the pros: great massage, reasonable pricesThe cons: a little bit unprofessional, not a very luxurious atmosphereI would go back though, as Galina did a great job on the massage.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 6, 28]}, "2": {"description": "I typically go to the larger name spas so I was a little skeptical going to more of a local spa.

The people here are extremely nice and they did an excellent job on my eyebrows. It was very natural and i was very happy. Couldn't have asked for a better service. My wife came from india and she is a pro when it comes to getting waxing and threading done. We were going on vacation with family and she got her arms waxed, and her face threaded over here. They did an exceptional job on threading, but BURNT her hands. It wasn't very noticeable at the beginning but by day 2, her hands had severe burn marks. I know it wasnt intentional, but it ruined our vacation and the scars wont probably go away for a while. Please note that Pratima was upset too. She called the staff and showed the marks. She will probably train them to not have this happen again. But I am not happy at all. My wife didnt have to be the guinea pig. I would never take my wife for waxing over here. They might be good with threading, but i wont trust them with waxing. I am extremely upset that my wife has to go through this.

The order arrived at about 9:00 pm, and although I asked the delivery driver not to ring the doorbell, he rang the bell anyway. We weren't thrilled with the service at this point, but were starving and hoping the the food would make up it. I honestly can't tell you how the food was because we weren't able to eat it. We ordered four pasta dishes and they were packaged in the typical \"foil on the bottom/plastic on the top\" to-go containers. But they had stacked the heavy pastas on top of one another so the containers on top had squashed the containers on the bottom. That's not typically a big deal, but it's a huge deal when the plastic top breaks and pieces of plastic get into the food itself. Two of our four pastas had pieces of plastic in the food. They had also put garlic bread in with the pasta, and it was flattened by the time it arrived to us. Again, that's not so bad, but the garlic bread was so stale that we couldn't even bite through it. We'd also ordered mozzarella sticks that were ice cold by the time they arrived to us. After multiple conversations with the manager (in which he said he'd have to call the owner if we wanted the order sent out again and/or a discount on the order - as a side note, I'd recommend that the owner give a manager this power so a call to the owner isn't necessary), we finally decided to return the whole thing and get all of our money back.

This is among many other things he ranted in his upraised yelling voice towards me that terrified me of him. I would be dead scared if I worked with or for him. Do not support this disgusting man he does not deserve to work in the food industry AT ALL. And by the was this was at 12:39 on a Thursday night. Ugh, just ew and disappointment. When we answered the door my husband and I were nervous to see who would be there waiting to chew us out... However is was a very very very friendly man named Tony who was great! He seemed to be under so much stress and pressure he was nervous handing out of good and forgot our pop. He looked over worked and if he had just been yelled at by this horrible boss he's working with and couldn't think straight when this older gentleman Tony was so sweet I could she the upset in his eyes. I will call back to talk to a daily manager and If it gets no where there will be other consequences.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken parmigiana sandwich. Neither of the meals came with fries or any side - you have to pay extra, $2.50 for french fries.When the delivery man came and left, I noticed a delivery charge of $2.50, which was not disclosed on their flyer or on the phone when I placed the order. \u00a0First of all, I live 5 minutes away, secondly, you need to inform customers of this charge. \u00a0Had I known I was being charged for delivery, I would've tipped the guy less. \u00a0Plus, I live 4 minutes away!!!! Absurd. \u00a0If you want to keep customers happy, you need to be transparent about your charges and not inconspicuously hide them to surprise us later.By the time the delivery came, both of our meals were not warm and barely edible. \u00a0The bread on both of our sandwiches was soggy. \u00a0I couldn't even pick up my sandwich as it immediately fell apart due to the soggy, soaked bread. \u00a0The bread fell apart, and I could only eat the veggies and meat with a fork. \u00a0My boyfriend's meal was the same; his bread was thicker than the panini bread, though, so he was at least able to hold it and start eating it like a sandwich is meant to be eaten. \u00a0He ended up eating the chicken only because like my bread, it was too soggy to continue eating - taste wise and mess wise. \u00a0The french fries were cold, some soggy and some just not fresh or even chewable. \u00a0Their temperature, taste, and texture were like fries you'd eat as leftovers the next day. \u00a0Therefore, we both didn't eat our fries.The meals were not enjoyable at all, timing of delivery was horrible, and pricing was way too expensive. \u00a0Furthermore, it was a WEDNESDAY! \u00a0If it was a weekend, I could at least justify the time it took because they'd be busier, but there was certainly no excuse when I live 5 minutes away. \u00a0I've ordered from restaurants way further and they've gotten warm, delicious, well-prepared meals to us within a half hour to 45 minutes. I would've rather cooked in this time frame than spend $25 on two horrible, inedible meals. \u00a0I would strongly encourage you to choose another establishment for your dining experience. \u00a0Stay away - you WILL be disappointed, guaranteed.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 11, 15]}, "15": {"description": "This review is specifically for Manager John. \u00a0\"YOU\" are the MAN!I ordered a plethora of food for myself along with 6 of my co workers.

We were NOT happy. I called and around closing time to share a few words with the Mama Mia employee who took my order. I asked him to make things right for me and my friends.

He made things right, just like a manager should. We couldn't believe our eyes on how above and beyond he had handled the situation. All of us were in shock and awe. It gets better. The next day John calls and leaves me a voicemail offering to treat our party to dinner to (once again) make things right. He wanted to give us the opportunity to experience his establishment the way it should be experienced. I can't begin to express how much this means to me.

You can smell the wonderful herbs and spices, and delectable meats as you walk into this joint. The food is made fresh everyday. We ordered two sandwiches: beef shawarma and chicken shawarma. The chicken had a wonderful garlic sauce and stuffed with excellent, savory condiments which made for the perfect amalgamation. It was tender, meritorious, fresh and scrumptious! I really liked how fresh the pita bread tasted. It was light and fluffy. We learned that they make it fresh everyday. Sweet! The sandwiches were a generous size and very filling for only $4.95. We ordered a Tahini salad for $2.95. They also offer Tabouleh and chopped shawarma-matik salads for the same price. Our sandwiches did not come with anything, so we assumed that maybe some items are a la carte. For an extra $2.29 you can purchase fries or a side of yellow rice. They have a very simple and limited menu, but I like this because this means great quality for the customer. Their kufta kabab plate is only $8.95 and it is a bargain considering that it comes with two skewers of ground beef and lamb mixed with a bit of grilled onions, tomatoes, garlic and parsley. If you do not eat meat, you may want to order a veggie falafel sandwich stuffed with fresh chopped salad and tahini sauce for only $2.95 (it is a huge sandwich) and get a side of humus or baba ghanouj. By the way, they offer lunch specials Monday - Friday for only $6.95, but I have no idea what their lunch specials consists of so if you go here for lunch just ask about their lunch specials. If you like hot tea, you must try their mint tea, which is excellent (only $1.45)! They have a self-serve area for your beverages with free refills. My friend had a soft drink, but I don't drink soda pop at all, so I was happy with a tall glass of water with my meal.

Solid, simple menu items with owners focusing on really fresh, made-to-order plates. We brought take-out home although there was available seating. Dinner smelled amazing when we got it home and the result? GOOD. Food. Not spicy (read: not hot/caliente), but flavorful. We've tried other Middle Eastern places in the area (tied with Chinese for favorite family cuisine), and this place does stand out for freshness- chicken shawarma and chicken tawook (menu spellings) were good for first trying out the menu. Falafel is freshly formed and fried (I watched the chef from a distance). Hummus had surprising tahini notes, and like the rest, FRESH. Add a little of their home garlic sauce to items and it's heaven on a plate. I could taste the individual spices in their rice and a little sliced pickle and was overall pleased. \u00a0Owner also asked us if we liked beef and gave us a little beef shawarma to try to go. Excellent.Less-expensive than some other Middle Eastern restaurants in the area and brand new, portion sizes were just right. Well-designed bright menus shout competency in the restaurant business for casual, inexpensive, modern Middle Eastern food. \u00a0Parking directly in front wasn't bad during rush hour.

The buffet has a couple kinds of cakes or brownies and fresh fruit. The food is always fresh and delicious. It doesn't sit out for hours on end getting cold or soggy. The biggest downfall? The prices. I suppose this goes with the territory of being in a hotel - it's the convenience factor. A salad will run you about 14 bucks...as will a sandwich.

We pointed this out to the waiter who said :What do you want me to do about it?\" We politely asked for it to be re-heated. They were ok, but there is paper at the bottom of the pizza pan they are in and everything sticks to it so you end up eating paper if you eat the bottom layer. The pizza was overcooked. We returned to this location this sunday - because the groupon was for this location. \u00a0We ordered the same pizza but ordered the spinach.artichoke dip. \u00a0The dip was thick and pasty and the bread that came with it seemed more like stale bread than toasted - no toasty color to it, just bone dry. \u00a0There is no way you can call this deep dish pizza. The bottom layer was a soggy, limp mess, you could not even pick up to eat. If this is deep dish, what is the thin crust? The crust was thinner than a saltine cracker! The crust was 1\" thick by about 1/4\" and hard as a rock. Deep dish is supposed to be \"bready\". - chewy, not crunchy. The pizza sauce is watery and tasteless.

Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and we walked out of there happy as a clam and stuffed. However, the service was definitely not on the strong side. I mean, we literally waited about 20 minutes at a time to fetch our waitress to bring us the yellow cards to mark what we wanted, another 20 minutes for her to pick them up, and yet another 20-25 minutes for the selected sushi to arrive (we saw our precise sushi orders sitting by the sushi bar, just waiting, and were inclined to pick them up ourselves, as it took the waitress at least 10 minutes to transport them two yards across to our table). She never checked on us, didn't bring us the drinks we requested, and we had to flag her down very tumultuously in order for her to even notice us LOL. Also, there was a strong odor of weed coming off of her - which could serve as some sort of explanation as to why she was so incredibly slow and confused. I would be back for the sushi itself (maybe a take-out/pick-up order next time?), however, if you don't intend to sit there unattended and ignored for at least 3 hours and get a pot-head as a server...

We drove by here last week, so we decided to grab a bite since we were in a hurry to get somewhere. I admit that the charbroil burger is still 4-star worthy. I love the flavor of the charbroil taste, and the burger was cooked to perfection. The quality of the meat was different from what I remember years ago, but it wasn't horrible. On the other hand, the quality of the Italian Beef meat was disappointing and way too salty. It was 2-star worthy (if that--maybe I am being generous rating it with 2-stars). My husband had the beef sandwich and he gave me some of the meat since it was loaded with tons of meat. I took one little bit of the meat and couldn't eat the rest of the meat that he so generously shared with me. I am not sure that I would stop off here again. The quality seemed to be lacking in some of the food items that we ordered. However, I would recommend their charbroil burger and freshly cut french fries. I am not usually a french fries fan, but my husband ordered some and insisted I try them. He was right -- they are really, really good fries. I hate to say this but the fries were much better than the Italian beef. The restaurant is located in a very small strip mall. Parking can be a little challenging since it is a small parking lot. They have a few tables with umbrellas outside, but with the restaurant being located on a busy street, you don't want to sit outside and ingest the truck, bus and car fumes with your meal. Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives -- this is definitely a diner and it has not changed since the last time we were here. The service is fast and hospitable.

I asked him about this and he acted annoyed and then reread the order form. Without saying anything he dumped the Coke and filled the cup with Diet Coke. UGH.

I appreciated that as I work in a corporate office building and that can get a bit confusing. Here's where it all went wrong. My cheesecake had mold on it. I didn't have to open the package up to see that big blue furry thing on top. I called and told them that it had mold and that I would like a refund, as it really wasn't worth the drivers' time to deliver me a new slice. Instead, they sent a driver to me with a new piece of cheesecake because the refund may have been to complicated...I'm sure if I ate on premise, they would have just given me a new slice and I would have been completely okay with that. But now I feel bad that the driver is coming all the here to give me a slice of a non-moldy cheesecake.UPDATE: Updating my 2 star to a 4 star based on customer service.

Well for starters the price range for a hair cut was $35-$90.

I take great care of my hair and it was in descent shape, I was just having a girl moment ad wanted a lil different edge to my current cut. The shampoo guy went into great lengths to tell me how horrible my hair was and he was going to put a deep conditioning conditioner on it. Well who the hell am I to know any better. So I sat there, and sat and sat. I started to feel like a lost child. Now its 2:15pm and I get rinsed and brought to the chair. Only to be greeted by a rude stylist who rolled his eyes at me when I was discussing what I wanted. Thank god I paid attention because I had to stop the cutting before I looked like Sinade O'Connor.

She was awesome. I wish she was there today. Me and my cousin went here today and some guy did her pedi and the older bigger built bib cut lady did my no chip...horrible experience for both of us!! Worst customer service I have ever experienced especially since this is a customer based industry. The guy was rushing to do my cousins toes... She didn't like the color on half of her foot so she decided to change it... Happens all the time no biggie right... Well he gave her attitude told her to pick something else so she did but he told her my lady was gonna finish her toes so she sat by me and nothing happened so I asked my lady who's gonna finish her pedi and she stated in the biggest attitude that he was waiting for my cousin to pick a color!! Even though she had 20 min ago and sat back down in her chair and watched him clean and pay no attention to her. So my lady told her he's gonna finish and he did but not without bumps along the way... He did not file down her nails evenly one was still cracked same as she came in.. She combined that there were clumps on her nails and she wanted him to fix that... Reasonable request since you're paying for a PEDICURE... There should be no lumps or running duh!... Well he acted so angry it made everyone uncomfortable.now to me.. I originally wanted to change it up and instead of a French no chip I wanted to do orange tips... Well after a one round one hand trial I decided nope, that looks stupid and decided on classic French... Well I got an awesome attitude(sarcasm)...she was horrible. My middle fingers didn't even match in color tip length and two were bunching..I asked her if that was normal...knowing fully well it wasn't, and she said oh yes that's normal! Uh huh looks like a child painted my nails!! I'm stupid and bc I have worked in the customer service industry I gave her a 30% tip which I regretted the tenth of a second I signed my receipt!!! Worst experience ever!!!!! I will never spend my money here again! Please be aware stay away!!! If you're not satisfied they won't fix it without attitude and tension. So uncomfortable!!! We both had the worst experience ever and this is a luxury.. Not many people can afford this luxury they should be great full for everyone that walks in but apparently not!

I don't even know where to begin. I normally have my own nail salon that I go to, but as a last minute event came up, I needed my nails done last minute and had no time to drive all the way to my usual salon. So I decided to try this neighborhood place. So to begin, this establishment is run by a husband and wife. My nails were being done by the husband. To start off, I told them that my nails were medium pink powder and they took out their light powder and told me it was medium thinking I wouldn't notice that my nail color wouldn't match. I asked for medium again and they insisted that I wouldn't know the difference. Then, if anyone is unfamiliar with acrylic nails, I was having a typical fill which required using the drill. As I'm sitting there, another technician comes stumbling behind mine and FALLS into him jolting his hand and CUTTING my finger with the drill! I immediately jumped from the pain and a few seconds later there came the blood. He continued doing my nail as if nothing happened!!! I couldn't believe it. Didn't ask if I was ok, nothing. Then I asked if he could please wipe the blood off my finger and told me that when I put my hands under the light that it would dry my blood....? Disgusted and annoyed I just thought whatever, I'm not going to argue I just want to leave. As my nails were under the light, in comes his wife to do a client with their salon dog. As she begins doing her client, her cuticle cutters falls to the floor. I turned to watch her as she looked around thinking about what to do. A moment later she blew on them and used them on her client! She didn't disinfect, sanitize them, nothing! Disgusted, I continued watching. She then proceeded to talk to her dog, and I watched trying to figure out what she was wanting him to do. In complete SHOCK I realized what she was asking!!! She wanted the dog to put the bottle of nail polish in its mouth and bring it to her husband for another client! At this point I was so disgusted I just wanted to leave. I said I needed to use the restroom before I left, which turned out to be like everything else...GROSS and UNSANITARY! As I looked around the bathroom I was surrounded by a knocked over mop bucket and the floor covered in nasty cleaning supplies. It was so filthy you could barely reach the sink to wash your hands.

When she asked for water, they filled the tub (no salt) and walked away for long enough for the tub to be a second away from over flowing. 2. Woman came in for mani and pedi with her daughter.

We're too busy\" the woman was shocked. Little girl ended up sitting on her moms lap to get her feet done. 3.
