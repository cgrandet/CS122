Unfortunately, I was not at all impressed. It gave me a better appreciation of Kim Nhung Super Store asian market where I go in Grand Rapids. I was puzzled why the prices at Broadway were much more considering Kim Nhung get their supplies from Chicago. For example, Golden Pampano fresh fish was $3.59 in Chicago while it was $2.99 at Kim Nhung. The produce at Broadway do not look fresh. The seafood and meat department are not the best. I can site other examples on pricing with snacks, tea, vegetables, seafood and the results are the same.I observed the same thing at a Joong Boo Korean market in Chicago compared to the one I go to in GR called Seoul Market. After these 2 experiences, I concluded that there was no point shopping for Asian goods in Chicago as the stores in GR are very competitive. Kim Nhung also has just as much if not more items. In fact they even dress and cut the fish there if you ask them. Broadway did not want to have anything to do with that.The other big issue that I take for granted when I go to Chicago until I am there is parking especially if you are staying overnight. Apparently, you need to have a 'neighborhood' parking permit. If caught without one when parked in the street, goodbye $75. Chicago is not very kind when it comes to parking.

There it was, right where I'd parked. Surprised to find it was a coffeehouse and not a restaurant, given its corner location at A'ville's major intersection.

Two strengths (single & dbl. shot) and two sizes (classic and \"workshop,\" whatever that was) for all their coffee drinks. No rainbow array of syrup bottles, no huge display of pastries, sandwiches, and whatever--just a couple of what they were featuring that day.My decaf cortado was perfect (the barista gladly made it a \"breve\"--with half & half--at no extra charge; will check out hemp milk later on, as I'm always looking for a low-carb alternative). There was a lovely bit of latte art, it was hot but not scalding, the taste was smooth and balanced and the texture nicely uniform. Music? So unobtrusive I didn't even notice it--which is the way I want it when I'm not going out specifically to hear live music.Drank my cortado, watched the world go by, and was on my way in under 10 minutes.

It was amazing to see the passion he put into sourcing the finest ingredients from around the world. When he opened a shop just down the street in Andersonville, we were itching to give his coffee a shot. I was not prepared for what we found.I'll admit, that 9/10 I'll lean towards Starbuck's over any other coffee shops -- not that there's generally that much of a choice. I know a small handful of independent coffee shops in various cities that outclass the Seattle juggernaut, but those are far and few between, in my humble opinion.But when we walked into Colombe, that list just widened. It's obvious that not only do they source amazing coffee, but they put a lot of emphasis into teaching their baristas to prepare it the right way. Every brew I've tasted gives you so much unique flavor, never with any bitterness or excess acidity. They just KNOW how to take the best ingredients, use them in the right way to make the perfect brew.I especially love the pull taps for the cold coffee. I highly recommend trying a \"Black and Tan\" (cold brew coffee with whole milk). I'm generally a \"straight black\" drinker, but when I come to La Colombe, that rich, milky concoction is just too much to pass up. What I love is that they don't mess with the coffee flavor... no stupid peppermint sugar spiked bullshit.

They sell hefty tray for $2.Savory Goodness: Ham and Egg Buns, Roast Pork Buns, Egg and Veggie Stir-Fry Concoction (contains small amount of shrimp and ham) that is served out of a giant wok that sits atop the glass counter all day.

They are consistently light, fluffy, spongy, and not too sweet. Like eating a really delicious cloud. And have I mentioned they're ridiculously cheap? I got an extra 3 of these for the road, but I would have bought out the entire stock if I could. I would sell my firstborn child to get my hands on their sponge cake recipe, it's THAT good.The red bean-filled sesame balls are also really tasty, especially when you get them hot - not overly greasy.

Thankfully they still had some, but they also had many other delicious looking pastries, as well as other delights like bbq pork buns. Despite its French name, La Patisserie P offers Asian items as well (both savory and sweet). Everything looked so elegant and well-crafted.In addition to two chocolate croissants, I also purchased an adorable mini strawberry mousse cake. The three items totaled about $8, which I found to be very reasonably priced.I thought the croissants were only okay, but to be fair, I did purchase them later in the day so perhaps they were baked that morning, and I also did not eat them until the following morning. The chocolate inside was a long piece of chocolate that was not really baked in, so it was hard. I much prefer when it's soft and melted inside.

We've had some ups and downs, so I thought it was time to write a review.Dollop has a lot going for it. There's lots of seating inside, and it has a quirky, casual vibe that characterizes few other local establishments -- it's got exposed brick walls, local art, and mismatched furniture. The stuff coming through the sound system is always a musical grab bag -- I don't like all of it, but the variety adds to Dollop's charm. There's a good variety of drinks and food (though I feel like the pastry selection has been veering toward vegan/gluten-free recently...none of it ever looks that appetizing anymore), and the coffee is good. My faves include the honey cinnamon latte, the Halloween seasonal spooky mocha, and the beach babe iced coconut latte. They serve Metropolis coffee, so it's pretty good stuff. I love the turkey sandwich and would gladly eat it every day. Prices are reasonable. The free wifi is touch-and-go.There are a few reasons for my three-star rating: 1. Through no fault of Dollop's own, temperature regulation is difficult during winter months. I typically head to Dollop on weekdays, and last winter it was so cold that I couldn't concentrate on my work. I always try to bag the seat in the back next to the radiator, but this didn't really help. It's just a really big place. Notably, the staff wear winter hats and scarves during these hours. Brrrr! Conversely, on weekends when the crowd is more bumpin', it gets pretty warm and, if it's been raining, muggy.2. Dollop suffers from a severe lack of safely positioned power outlets. Each wall socket has a power strip that serves the nearest 6-8 customers, so getting back to that seat next to the radiator poses a major trip hazard. It's really dangerous, and I'm always afraid that I'm going to bite it when I'm carrying my very full coffee.3. Most significantly, I get weird vibes from the staff. I go there a lot, and they don't go out of their way to be gregarious. A smile and a, \"Hey, how's it going?\" wouldn't go amiss. Also, there are things that the staff have done that border on condescending. I followed them on Twitter for a while, and they posted a picture of a piece of gum stuck to a plate with a caption that was something like: \"You guys. This is unacceptable.\" Um...is it not someone's job to do the dishes? In the bathroom there used to be a handwritten sign that said something like: \"If you're grown up enough to drink coffee, you're grown up enough to throw your paper towels in the trash can. Dollop *Heart*s you more when you do the right thing.\" I understand that it can be irritating when people are slobs, but I don't really enjoy being passive-aggressively lumped into the slob category. Plus, if I wanted to be treated like a misbehaving child, customer service at Chase bank is only a phone call away.After this sign went up, I've been willing to travel the extra distance to go to Metropolis in Edgewater where the staff are friendly and the electrical outlets are less precarious.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 11, 3]}, "23": {"description": "Dollop, oh Dollop. \u00a0How can I write an objective review? \u00a0You symbolize the single life to me. \u00a0A time of living in the City, with fewer responsibilities. \u00a0A time when I could wake up late on Sunday, and wile away the day with the newspaper. \u00a0I think I had a couple of first and only dates here. \u00a0Perhaps \u00a0choosing to work from here today is both sweetly nostalgic and somewhat masochistic. \u00a0We cannot recapture our youth. \u00a0To get down to the important stuff, the coffee and pastries are both quite good. \u00a0Not setting the world on fire good, but solid. \u00a0Dollop gets an extra star for nearly perfect decor, with a wonderful tucked-away back room. \u00a0This is one of the best places to hang out in Buena Park, a small neighborhood that is not quite Uptown or Lakeview. \u00a0Now I will get back to living in the present moment.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 21]}, "47": {"description": "This is one of the best independent coffee shops in all of Chicago.

You see, jackfruit is pretty rare in the States. We don't get that a lot here. So I found this out when walking by the Ba Le downtown. I popped in, and randomly ordered the smoothie with jackfruit to satisfy my thirst and curiosity. After the first sip, it was added to the list of things I'll recommend to people if they go for SE Asian food. Like most fruits, you can't really describe it in terms of other ones you've had. Imagine trying to tell someone the taste of an apple if they have only eaten citrus before. So try it.Anyway, the Banh bao are nice. Different from more Chinese ones as they have a quail egg in, and Ba Le only has pork-stuffed ones, from what I saw. They're a bit bigger than the ones you get at Wow Bao as well. Two is a meal; three is gluttony.

The bahn mi was toasted to perfection and very tasty. I've had the bahn mi at Tank and I honestly think the sandwiches here are much more flavorful. The pho was very comforting and just left me wishing I had more. The Vietnamese iced coffee is good and it comes in quite a large size, but it is quite strong so beware of the caffeine!If you're craving good Vietnamese food/snacks and you want a relatively clean environment, Ba Le is the way to go. It's also great if you're in a rush - they have spring rolls and many other yummy snacks that are meant to be taken on the go!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 2, 2]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Uptown"], "latitude": 41.9732, "longitude": -87.66024, "rating": "4.0", "times": {"Mon": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Thu": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Sat": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Wed": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Tue": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Sun": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"], "Fri": ["7:30 am", "9:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Bakeries", "bakeries"], ["Vietnamese", "vietnamese"], ["Sandwiches", "sandwiches"]], "address": ["5014 N Broadway St"], "attributes": {"Parking": "Street, Private Lot", "Take-out": "Yes", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Wi-Fi": "No", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes", "Noise Level": "Average", "Caters": "Yes", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "No", "Delivery": "No", "Waiter Service": "No", "Good for Kids": "Yes", "Attire": "Casual", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "Ambience": "Casual", "Has TV": "No", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Good for Groups": "No", "Good For": "Lunch"}, "category": "Restaurants", "number_of_reviews": "680"}}
