We came inside and the place was surprisingly empty but we had our pick of seats, so that was nice. A few people came in and out, but the puny amount of guests meant we could enjoy our meal in peace. And that's exactly what we did. The server was so nice to us. She was also attentive. We needed lots of time to decided what to eat/drink but she didn't care. She just kept coming back to check on us. They had lots of TVs playing Telenovelas and it wasn't exactly what I'd call quiet, but it was fine. For a gringa like me, it's pretty funny to sit there and listen to what they're saying, trying to decipher the Spanish.We finally placed our order after having stuffed ourselves on fresh tortilla chips and spicy homemade salsa. They keep bringing them out to you pretty much once you sit down. Fairly standard at most places like this, but I thought I should make that clear you get complimentary chips and salsa with your meal. I ordered a veggie burrito dinner plate. My friend also ordered a burrito dinner and had one of the banana shakes. I went with a boring Diet Coke, but the shake was amazing. I'll definitely have that next time I come in!!! Don't make the mistake of getting the soda like I did, especially if you want the full Mexican dining experience. You can get soda anywhere, those shakes are just too yummy to pass up! The food came and the presentation was fantastic. The burrito dinners were GINORMOUS! A seriously massive burrito covered in sour cream (ours were fancy out of pastry frosting servers - see my pictures I added) served with rice, refried beans with cheese sprinkled on top and some fresh strips of lettuce, a few tomato and avocado slices. YUM! We chowed down and since my friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while, we would up staying for over 2 hours! As I said, the place wasn't busy and the waitress didn't care how long we stayed. So we gabbed away and she would periodically check on us. It couldn't have been nicer.

After a week, I never got a call to tell me that it had been diagnosed. I called and they said to give them a couple more days, and they would call me by the end of the following business day.

This time though it wasn't the case at all. In June I broke my gfs iPhone screen and took it to ubrakeifix, I've had a MacBook that needed to be fixed as well so I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. My gf was able to pick her phone up the same day but they said the MacBook would be ready in a week. I called a week later and asked if my MacBook was ready, the way the person spoke on the phone it was like they were clueless of MacBook even being there. They put me on hold and 5 mins later they find the MacBook and said they haven't had a chance to look at it yet and proceeds to ask me what is wrong with it . I remained calm and explained the issue they said ok we will take a look at it and we'll give you a call in a couple days, I never received a call. I called a week later again and asked about the MacBook, again they told me they had techs look over it, and they didn't see the issue I explained they said the hard drive just needed to be replaced. They told me the amount of the services and when the parts would be in to get my MacBook up and running, again I was told I was going to get a call back, never received that call. So 2 weeks later I call back and asked about the status of my MacBook and they say the part still hasn't come in... A month later I call again and ask the status of my MacBook, they tell me they put the hard drive in and it didn't work still. They said the techs looked over it again and IT WAS THE ISSUE I BROUGHT IT IN FOR AND EXPLAINED TO THEM OVER THE PHONE OVER A MONTH AGO! So now they have to order the parts for that. It is now the end of August and I still do not have my MacBook. I went to the location a few days ago so I can speak to someone in person to see if the were really bull shitting me, I was GUARANTEED that my MacBooks part would arrive Monday 8/24 and I would be able to pick up my device at end of day. I called twice to see if that part was in and the 1st time I was told it would arrive at 3pm I called after 5pm and was then told no shipment has arrived.

So, semi long story- I shattered my iPhone screen (for the second time- I'm a klutz) and took it to uBreakiFix for same day replacement at a lower price than Apple. It was ready promptly in less than an hour and looked great! However, problems arose when I took it home and the screen was occasionally a little \"glitchy\" in a way it hadn't been before (a Google search tells me that this can be known to happen when replacing the iPhone screen). I called uBreakiFix and they were totally nice about me bringing it back in for them to look at it. After some time waiting for it to get glitchy again so they could see what was going on, they agreed to replace the screen. This is where things went downhill for my phone. Apparently, when they tried to swap out screens, my phone flat out refused to work! Ahh! To make matters worse, I was leaving in less than 48 hours for a 5 week trip and desperately needed a working phone. My tight timeline meant that they didn't have enough time to run diagnostics on it and figure out what was going on. So, because they're the best and they stand by their work, they decided to just replace my phone with a brand new one- at no cost to me. AND, because they could only get an appointment at the Apple store after they closed, the manager Eddy stayed late and drove it to me. \u00a0I repeat- HE DROVE THE PHONE TO ME so I wouldn't have to go out of my way. Unbelievable. I honestly have never had better customer service. They took a stressful, potentially disastrous situation and turned it into one that I am constantly raving about to my friends.

I had no idea the Small Bar franchise was soccer centric, but it was a welcomed change especially with World Cup fever in the air. Also, when they say \"Small\" Bar, they mean it. It's not a big space but it doesn't need to be. There is a nice long bar on one side, a few large bench tables on the other side and table-tops in between. The menu fits with the setting serving pizza, sandwiches and bar food starters. Additionally, the beer list is as good as I've seen in a while with many craft brews on tap. While the food wasn't bad, I'd make a return trip focusing on drinking and not eating. As for the food, we started with a bowl of their \"fabled\" veggie chili. I love chili so I was a little disappointed when the bowl resembled a bean salad more than chili. I love beans, but chili to me is still tomato based with onions, spice and cheese. It also came with a mound of sour cream (to each their own I respect), which kind of defeats the purpose of a vegetarian healthy dish. I enjoyed the beans, flavors and cheese, it just wasn't what I would call veggie chili. We were craving pizza so we browsed the very appealing pizza list and went with the BBQ chicken. The pizza's are 14'', so they serve more than two people, and cost $14. I was impressed with the pizza, but not blown away. Very good for bar food, especially something other than pepperoni or plain. I forgot that BBQ pizza is hard to eat a lot of, and we should have ordered something simpler for our own tastes. I would be curious to try their other pies, especially vegetarian focused options.

You've got two giant HD TVs to watch your favorite sports games, the staff is very knowledgeable about soccer and friendly and the food is great. Let's say you are a raging alcoholic, you're even going to find a deep beer menu that will leave your taste buds dazzled.I first went to Small Bar Fullerton to hop on the Section 8 Chicago Fire fan bus that drives you to the Chicago Fire game. Before people load up on the bus, they get loaded at the bar and all meet up there. Small Bar is a very good soccer bar since they will open up early to let us addicted soccer fans come watch soccer early in the morning. 6:45am beer is not usually everyone's first choice, so they have plenty of coffee ready!With two 65\" TVs mounted on the wall, it's hard to miss any details of the big game should you choose to watch it there. But let's say you're hungry, well then it's time to dig into brunch! I've always rocked the Countrymen's skillet and like it well done because it's loaded up with egg, taters, veggies and will do the trick so early in the morning. Not in the mood for eggs and potato so early in the morning? They'll even let you bite into the rest of the menu. As for me, I've taken a shot at the Bacon and Egger, which is a fierce burger ready to knock your socks off. Oh, so now you are looking for a drink in this venue? I'd have to say my favorite beer in here's the Half Acre Daisy Cutter on tap, but I've also had some wicked Spaten Octoberfest in liter steins enough to knock your socks off. The beer is deep, but if you want to go for true value, hit up the PBR and Bullit Whiskey for $6 or $7 and double down!Sometimes people have special occasions and Smallbar is up to the challenge. With a large second floor available for private events, Smallbar regularly hosts Man-B-Que events and I've had the pleasure of throwing a party at Smallbar and loading it up with a few dozen of my best friends. The service is good and the venue is great for all events large and small.

I wasn't given water or utensils or the customary bread basket to eat while waiting for your order.3rd I ordered my food- white rice and beans and bistec encebollado (steak smothered with onions) and let me tell you that this was the worst meal I have had in a long time. the beans were bland the rice was salty and the steak was fried in a pan( the customary way to prepare this dish is to slowly cook it in its ingredients and served so it can literally fall apart which wasn't the case here, the meat was tough and did not taste anything like the traditional plate....SAD!4th when the girl brought me the order she says , 'is there anything else I can get you?' and I replied , yes something to eat it with- no need to explain further.5th if you walk out a restaurant smelling like grease, what does that tell you?any how, I wont go on saying how great this is because everyone who claims it is has got to be out of their mind. There are lots of Puerto Rican restaurants out there now that far exceed this restaurant which has had its peak years ago.

Many months ago, while having dinner with the kids, we noticed a group of gangbangers walk in and pretty much run the place. They even went into the kitchen and made it clear to the chef, to make sure he gave them the good meat. The owners son even said \"what's up\" to them as if they were friends. This has always been a family restaurant to me and at that moment i knew it was time to go. The whole feeling of the place just left us uncomfortable. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because we knew the owners and everything and just brushed it off.Over the next couple of times, we noticed we kept getting charged differently. The same meal would basically fluctuate from high to low. In conversation with a friend he said he had noticed that they would add in the tip without telling you (that's why they never give you a receipt). I still didn't believe it, I mean I can basically say I grew up there!!Then i went again, same meal we always have with my boyfriend and kids, something that cost us $40 ended up at $60!!!!

I was in love when I started lathering up the shampoo. \u00a0It's weird to feel like you're washing your hair with a bar of soap, but that's where the similarity ends. This stuff bubbled like crazy and the smell was amazing (yet not overpowering). \u00a0It rinsed out cleanly and my hair felt squeeky clean.The conditioner bar also lathered up like soap, which I found very odd. I was originally wondering how it would work as a bar, but it actually did ok. It too smalled wonderful. I was a bit less pleased with the end results of the conditioner as it didn't do well for detangling, but the overall feel of my hair afterwards made up for it. I had to use a bit of moisturizer spray to get a comb through afterwards, but I was still happy with the final result.I'd be quite happy to purchase more of their products as I need to restock. Their website says they're distributed at Whole Foods as well as given the option to shop online from their site. The site doesn't indicate the shipping cost until you fill in your information though.

However, they are helpful enough to make you feel comfortable about buying something through them in one of their catalogs.Erin walked us through the catalogs and told us the different price ranges. She was extremely knowledgeable about her furniture and I really felt like she was trying to help us find the right piece and not upsell us. When we came back two days later to make our purchase, Erin walked us through all the final decisions and even pulled couch pillows off of their models to help us find the perfect fabric. We decided on a beautiful Rowe sleeper sofa that was in our price range. Definitely a better deal than most places we have been to, and you just WANT to buy from them because they are so darn friendly and down to earth.

Since it was only a short walk away, I thought I'd try my luck. I had been warned about sleazy furniture salespeople in general, so I put on my \"the world is out to screw me but I won't let them\" cap. Bring it on. Thanks to Erin and Tony, I did not end up with battle scars that would stay with me for life. In fact, it was a very pleasant shopping experience altogether! They were willing to help me work within my budget, and did not hover or push sales while my mom and I were going through the catalog and testing out various couches. There had been an Ashley couch that I'd seen online that had looked promising, but it turned out to be uncomfortable. Arghhh... Then I came across a couch that I liked (a gorgeous chocolate brown recliner loveseat). Much to my dismay, it exceeded my price range by quite a bit. When I expressed my concern, Erin/Tony suggested that I take the (2 month old) floor model for a reduced price. Still above my budget so they threw in the pillows too. They also said it could be delivered the next day. Ok, DEAL. My thinking was that if I was going to sit on it for the next few years, I might as well invest... I kept my fingers crossed the next 24 hours awhile I waited for my couch, but it turned out I didn't need to do that. The movers arrived slightly ahead of schedule and I didn't need to lift a finger. Done!Now, a few days later, I absolutely love my couch and am so happy I decided to invest in it!

We were in the market for a sleeper sofa for a new second bedroom. We couldn't decide if we wanted to go with a cheapy one or get a nicer one for when guests stay. We had looked all around at the big furniture stores and had a couple of \"finalists\" in mind. We came to Far Below Retail since the reviews were so good and it was close to our church so we thought we'd give it a try. As soon as we walked in, Erin and Tony were so welcoming, friendly, and gave us the low down and a glass of wine for me and beer for the husband. Erin sat with us and told us about the different options of sleeper sofas. It's a big warehouse, but only a handful of selections on the floor, which I could see as a bummer since I like to see something before I purchase it. However, they are helpful enough to make you feel comfortable about buying something through them in one of their catalogs.Erin walked us through the catalogs and told us the different price ranges. She was extremely knowledgeable about her furniture and I really felt like she was trying to help us find the right piece and not upsell us. When we came back two days later to make our purchase, Erin walked us through all the final decisions and even pulled couch pillows off of their models to help us find the perfect fabric. We decided on a beautiful Rowe sleeper sofa that was in our price range. Definitely a better deal than most places we have been to, and you just WANT to buy from them because they are so darn friendly and down to earth. Erin quoted us the amount the first time we came in, and our final price stayed true to that amount (plus taxes and delivery) which was great, because I feel like most places will pull random charges out of nowhere when you are about to hand them your credit card.Would highly, highly, highly recommend this place.

Eight days ago, we went into this store. We quickly selected a couch. We would have happily bought the couch on the floor, but they encouraged us to look through their samples and get any variations on it that we would like. We chose just a few variations. The perky saleswoman very casually told us, \" Oh yeah, we'll just send off these specs and call you the second it hits our floor.\" We never asked for a date because her demeanor suggested that it would be in quickly. We spent approximately $2000. When she handed us the terms and conditions she discouraged us from reading it, pointing to where to sign and saying \"this just means that if you don't like the couch, you can't send it back.\" When we hadn't heard in over a week, we called them. They told us the sofa would not be in for five more weeks.My husband called them. The saleswoman was rather rude and unhelpful. Rather than trying to fix the problem, she told my husband, \"Well, how long did you expect it to take?\" He responded with, \"I didn't know. You're the furniture professional. It was your job to tell me. \" She refused to take responsibility and continually implied that we should have expected it would take six weeks without being informed. They refused to cancel the order and give our money back despite that it was five \u00a0more weeks until we got the sofa. We even were willing to go with the original floor model, but they told us that it would be three weeks because, according to them, \"it's our best seller and if we sold it, we would lose thousands.\" In other words, they would rather mislead customers to make thousands of dollars than run a customer-oriented business with integrity. Finally, they cited the terms and conditions that we were discouraged from reading, stating that there were no refunds once the order was put in. This was the exact same person that discouraged us from reading it in the first place. Normally, I am quite vigilant about reading those, but they had inspired so much trust that I let her rush us through. If, after you read this, you still decide to shop here, be sure that you both get an estimated date in writing and don't let them deter you from reading their own Terms and Conditions.

I would love to be able to spend $3k or more for some of the furniture that I have found, but I can't. Finally, \u00a0I came across Far Below Retail on Yelp.

If that were the only goal of posting a review here, I would hold my punches and be more generous with the star ratings. But you who follow these reviews deserve an honest one. I ordered off Googoo's Table's carry-out menu listing of \"Stir-fried Noodle,\" specifically their chicken Chow Fun, which is typically made with broad (about 1-inch-wide) rice noodles. I was jonesing for the crispy edges when those noodles get saut\u00e9ed. Hope was running high when as I was placing the order, the woman behind the counter corrected me on the pronunciation of the noodle as \"fun\" instead of \"foon\" (from Cantonese menus). But the first surprise came when I arrived home with my order and found the noodle used was the much thinner chow mein noodles - a totally different mouth experience! DRAT! So I won't let that disappointment sway my review, but note that there is some miscommunication between the ordering and the kitchen. Luckily, both noodle dishes are the same price.Another surprise, but luckily NOT a disappointment was that included with the vegetable ingredients (sliced carrots and sliced broccoli - the Italian type most Americans know), was a small handful of \"Chinese broccoli,\" which has broad leaves and crisp stalks instead of the florets of the \"American\" type. This was a nice surprise because both broccolis were well cooked and properly crispy. There was a good amount of garlic flavor to those dark greens too.The menu is nothing that exciting or ground-breaking. But for those used to ordering elsewhere at Chinese or Thai restaurants with similar menus, the prices are about a dollar higher per order. And unlike at some (mainly Cantonese) restaurants, there are no half orders, just the one full-size order.

A bit spiffier looking than most Chinese joints, but they don't market themselves as \"gourmet\" like some of the restaurants around here. I ordered the fish ball noodle soup, orange chicken, combo fried rice, 2 egg rolls, and two smoothies (durian and lychee). Delivery showed up 10 minutes earlier than expected, they restaurant also called me a few minutes after I placed the order to let me know they didn't have enough Durian to make a smoothie so instead I chose Jackfruit.Portions are good for the price. The egg rolls are handmade which is definitely a plus! They look like spring rolls and are delicious!!! The orange chicken barely had any sauce on it and the sauce didn't have that hint of orange we all know and love, but they were alright. My only gripe is the \"fish\" noodle soup. Looks like scallops and you have to assemble the soup yourself. The broth and fish balls are in a container, onions, bean sprouts, green pepper and lime are in plastic bag while the noodles are in another container too. Once assembled it was still pretty meh.The fried rice is hands down the best in the area. Overall 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Sure. I noticed this happen to at least three couples that had previously been seated in the center. It took quite a while for the guacamole and margaritas to make it out to the table. Unfortunately, we still had no chips. As quickly as items were placed on our table our waitress was gone. I understand that it was busy, but we deserve a little attention here. We waited and waited.

I personally prefer plain churros so when I tried the chocolate and the cream cheese churro, there were too rich and overwhelming. Still okay if you like that stuff - Churritos ($2.05): comes with 8 small pieces that were good if you prefer more of the cinnamon sugar coating and crunchy exterior. Personally, we felt as though the normal original churros were much better. Churro Sundae (~$3.20) - Ice cream was sub-par. Nothing out of the ordinary and I actually feel like it clashed with the churro we had. So next time, I would omit it or get Vanilla Ice Cream. Overall, the quality of churros here was quite good, fresh, and crisp. The cinnamon sugar crystals were a bit larger and not fine sugar crystals, compared to other churro places I have tried. Nonetheless, Xocoatl has great prices and available year round! I'm excited for Xocoatl because they have a nice parking area in the back so it makes it very convenient for their customers.

I ordered a gyro sandwich with fries, jalepeno poppers, and had a coupon for a free 1 liter soda. First I would like to state if your gyro meat comes in a box, pre-formed in \"gyro patties\" you should not be able call it a gyro. In Chicago gyro meat is cut off a gyro spit, not that pre-cut box garbage I was fed. The tzatziki sauce, if you could call it that, was just sour cream and grilled instead of raw onions were used. My friends, this is not a gyro, needless to say I threw away 80% of that sandwich. The coupon stated a free 1 liter soda with an order of $10 or more. So I ordered the jalepeno poppers to meet the dollar amount on the coupon. What I was given was a CAN of soda. I would like to attribute this to the lack of understanding of the unit of measure ,since no one in the US uses the metric system, but that is obviously not the case since a can and a liter of soda are both listed on their menu at different prices, so why would they give a coupon for a free liter and only give a can?

The difference seems to lie mostly in the atmosphere... Whereas Lindo Poncitlan casts a clean, family-friendly vibe, Poncitlan Azteca is plastered with Corona posters and margarita specials, clearly targeting a drinking crowd. Laid out like a diner, it seems Poncitlan Jalisco is a bit livelier than both, and has something for all types- solo diners, girls' nights out, dates, intellectual conversationalists.\"SIIII, PEEERRROOO [INSERT INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLECTUAL SPANISH HERE]!\" the second Latino shouted, slamming his fist onto his table and leaping to his feet.All was quiet for a good moment, until a smile slowly came across the first guy's face.\"Es lo mismo,\" (it's the same) he said, softly and gently.

In the end of my excursion, I found a nice dark beige 21' inch Dockers luggage for $30 (really satisfied).

I don't normally do reviews, but the hipster douchebag who bitched about the artichoke heart pizza he couldn't eat, yet left in his fridge for some insane, yet no-doubt esoteric, self-righteous reason was enough to get me to respond.This is the neighborhood pizza joint Guy's used to be, before they became ashamed of being in Humboldt Park, and began chasing the ever-flaky, perpetually idiotic Wicker Park demographic. Mom's is small, unsophisticated, humble, and just downright terrific. I have no idea who the owner is, other than some older lady who called my cell one time to ask why I was spending so much ordering through grubhub every week when I could've saved $6 on every order by going through their new website. Say what you will about your petulant \"Big Brother\" nonsense - if my pizza lady is willing to keep track of what I order to provide me better value, I'm totally sold.The pizza speaks for itself. The gravy is perfection, the mozzadell is plentiful, and the sausage is the best I've had since my childhood in NYC.However, I tried the baked mostaccioli with meatballs a few weeks back, and as a result, will probably not order another pizza from them until December. The meatballs are, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the best I've ever had. They are sublime, and are enough to resurrect memories of my Brooklyn childhood. If Mom's ever decides to start selling meatball parm sandwiches, I'll gladly go to my Heavenly reward with one stuck in my piehole.As for the delivery time, I'm fortunate enough to live two blocks from the place, so I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes. But, if you live in some over-priced, Bohemian shithole and have to wait more than an hour for food from a neighborhood you hate anyway, then perhaps you'd be better off calling Papa John's.

Maybe customer service from Nicole C just shined through. Or just maybe it was all of the above and more. Yes, yes, yes, and yes! As you walk in, the open spacious store invites you to check out everything. They even have a custom bar in the back with computers to allow you to custom order any bag they make. Next to the computers are the sample swatches of the different materials used to make every custom bag. The proud panted Chicago flag wall just hangs behind the registers. \"Go ahead, take your things, and stuff it in any of the bags to see if you like any of the bags,\" as Nicole C suggests to me and I did just that. She was patient and suggestive based on the requirements I had. At the end, I ended up making a custom bag on one of their computer. Do it in the store! They get credit for helping you!

In fact it's truly classy- on par with the Clipper, even, if much forgotten in the decades since this was the property of a successful showbiz star. The highlight is the winding brass rail along the wildly curvaceous barfront.
