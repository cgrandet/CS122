I had been bringing my family here since 2003. We went on Sunday, \u00a0 Aug. 9th at 7:30pm. They had 6 ladies and a guy working. Was not that busy. Not only are they aloof with their customers but they are very lethargic when taking your order. They \u00a0need someone to help them with a better system so they are not so \u00a0disorganized taking orders. The paletas are not as good quality as before. They do have great paletas, however... with so much competition now, and their horrible customer service at this location, \u00a0I don't mind taking my family of 6 to have paletas elsewhere. All 6 ladies working there were in a circle chatting and chewing on something. They completely ignored us. Wow. I thought they needed customers to stay in business. I guess they don't need anymore customers.Same paletas \u00a0if not better ones with much better customer service are found on by 3320 W. 55th St south of here.

Tropicana was exactly that place I've had in mind for awhile to go to, after browsing around reviews on the south and southwest side.They had a decent variety of flavors, give or take around two dozen, but I taken aback a little by surprise that they didn't allow samples of any of their ice creams. In addition, I thought there should've been some kind of signage on the glass side of the cooler holding the ice creams, as to where each flavor was. Regardless, I got a 2-scoop cone of both mango and pistachio ice cream. The pistachio ice cream was amazing, and possibly may now be my new favorite pistachio ice cream anywhere. Mango was pretty decent, too.I finished off my trip here by getting a watermelon fruit bar. Wasn't bad, but didn't like the fact there were a lotta seeds in it. At least I know next time to ask the staff beforehand which of their fruit bars does not have seeds in it. Thought it was interesting too that in addition to selling nachos and cheese, you could actually get Cheetos and cheese here for $1.25! (though I doubt I'll get that anytime soon)Price-wise, this place had excellent value for the things they sold. Both things I got were $5.34(after tax) in total, but ordered both separately to savor my experience here. The 2-scoop cone was only $3.91, and the fruit bar was just $1.43! The credit card minimum is $10(the sign that said this didn't list which credit cards they accept), based on a sign I saw, and in case anyone drives here, parking didn't seem too difficult to find on Kedzie.

The location is unexpected for anyone who's not really super familiar with the south side, which makes it a fun \"out of the way\" place to take someone on a date. For the last 10 years this place has been my favorite little secret, especially when I was living nearby and could take the 55th street bus right to it.The flavors are posted in Spanish only, and sometimes the person at the counter doesn't really speak English. Be ready with at least a little Spanish when you order, just in case.My personal favorites are the one made with crushed pecans (nuez), the prune one that has a prune right on the stick (ciruela pasa?), and the one filled with sweet goat's milk caramel (cajeta). Some of the flavors are salty and can be very spicy (mango con chile for example), so don't get those if that's not the kind of experience you're looking for. All of the fruit flavors are made with fresh fruit and are delicious.I've heard good things about the place down the street, \"Tacos Villa\", but haven't tried it yet. So maybe I'll stop by Tropicana again in the next couple of days...Oh, one more hot tip: the parking right outside the place is \"a rush hour no parking\" zone, so don't park there from 4 to 6.

It was marble with strawberry filling. It was delivered on time and in good condition and they followed our design requests.In July, we ordered a Sweet 16 cake for 150 people as well. The cake was delivered late. The theme of the cake was supposed to be candy land so we asked for some large lollipops as the toppers on the cake. The gentleman who delivered the cake by himself cracked several of the lollipops and simply left them all over the cake and did not bother to fix it. For some reason they also put feathers in the cake which was not part of the original design at all (feathers with candy???). I had to glue pieces of the lollipops together so that it would be harder to tell that they were broken.My mom (the Sweet 16 cake was for my sister) spoke to an employee about the problems and the employee said that my mom would get a call to try to come up with some sort of solution for the bad experience but the bakery never got back to her.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 11, 17]}, "1": {"description": "I knew I should have gone to Bon Bon or Sprinkles bakery first but I was so blown away by how pretty this bakery was, and trying to support a small local business that I thought could handle my order.

When I picked them up, these cupcakes were embarrassing, I thought I can't let people know I paid for these and I actually thought of switching them from the cake box they came in, to a cupcake pan. No fondant on any cupcake but printed edible paper, totally not what I paid for. I was too sad/shocked/disappointed to be angry so I paid and left.So after this all sank in about an hour later, I drove back to the bakery with all the cupcakes.

As I was leaving with the $40 basic cake and the cupcakes, the lady told me to leave the cupcakes because she refunded me for them.

Their salsa is as unique as the smiling attitude, The sign outside reads salsa de molcajete, that means old school. \u00a0How old? About a couple thousand years of tradition. \u00a0Most home cooks and restaurant cooks use blenders for their salsa, Brisas uses a morter and pestle, the salsa is still hot, I don't think it is the best salsa by any stretch of the imagination, but it is beautiful and I am in love with the concept of someone \u00a0bashing chiles, tomatoes, and garlic together just for me. \u00a0 \u00a0The menu is large, excellent Shrimp dishes, the steak dishes are great with ample sides, but the standouts are the enchiladas estilo Guerero(sic) fresh handmade tortillas with chicken and a bright red chile sauce and just a sprinkle of aged cheese, served with rice that is always fresh and not all crunchy and some of the best refritos ever. \u00a0The refried beans are also representative of the detail in this restaurant, you can taste the toasted onion and the texture is always creamy instead of pasty, delicioso.

I go there pretty often and on my most recent visit ( around 9:45 pm) there was a line out the door. Really that good.Why an update? Well, they have an ever growing menu and it could be overwelming to decide what you want. But on the other hand you will surely find something of your liking. Some of the items are icecream, icecream bars.... \u00a0 As I pause to think about their menu I realize that it is more extensive that I thought.... \u00a0 fresh fruit water, tortas, hot dogs and burgers.Some weird items like: hot chips and nacho cheese, the other day I tried a vampire for the first time. It was crazy good, try to have your taste buds get a hold of this combination: \u00a0mango ice cream, chopped fresh mango, a squeeze of lime juice topped with chamoy (salty-sweet-sour-spicy tamarind based chutney) this vampire thing is crazy good and a contradiction of flavors party in your mouth that some how works great and will have addicted from the first taste.Tortas de pierna are so simple but so good. They also have burgers, but I have not had them and will not likely get them. Malt shakes, ice cream shakes, even some flan and cakes.Separate paragraph for their yogurt and fresh fruit. Weird name that Mexicans gave to this combination \"atomico\". Wide array of fresh fruit to choose from: apple, strawberry, mango, banana, guayaba, grapes; in a plain or flavored (strawberry, vanilla, pecan) yogurt topped with granola, chopped pecans and/or raisins. I like it but not but would not kill anyone for it. I did notice that about 50 % of their customers get this.

And if you are thinking what is the difference \u00a0well is like comparing store bought, regular bread to home made bread. I had been to this restaurant \u00a0when it was on Kedzie. Now that they opened in this new location I had to come and check them up again. I was there with a friend for Sunday breakfast. I ordered the Luna Gonzalez breakfast (really cool name ha?) \u00a0, 2 sunny side eggs, rice beans and poblano peppers and cheese with meat and grilled onions and avocado. Everything was good. They have some items that I have seen only here.They also have quesadillas, and they must be affiliated or got the recipe from La Reyna del Sur in the north side, and they give them credit for it. God forbids plagiarism in a Mexican restaurant in a land where most of them serve about the same fare LOL. But this makes up very little of their menu along with fresh fruit juices and smoothies.They also have burritas, not to be confused with burritos. Burritas are smaller and simpler. With only a few ingredients but very good as well. What is good about them is that they are made with home made flour tortillas. Gorditas Durango Style are big in this place, I wish I had tried a few. The service is nice, although they did take some time to bring the food. But I would like to think is is because they are taking time to caringly prepare my food.I am not a menudo person, in fact I have never tried it. And don't call the Mexican food police I know it is is crime that I haven't. Where was I going with this???? ..,.. Oh yea, they have menudo here (only on the week ends) and must be really good because more than 50% of patrons were having menudo. Maybe I will come back and try it here. Price wise, I would say that it is a little higher than many Mex. places around here (not crazy expensive tough) but again it is the little extra that they put into the food that might make it worth the small price difference.Keep an eye for the weekly special (good deal on good food)LPD It's good, it's slow, enjoy it.

Great decor and atmosphere. The food however, its like a restaurant for little people. Luckily the prices also reflect that. I've been here twice to try various things to see if they had something that sticks out but no cigar. The tacos, gorditas, burritos, and all are small. Its like a Mexican version of White Castle because they are all like sliders. If you order 3 tacos at a place with good size tacos, it would take about 5 from this place. The waitress we had was not familiar with their own menu. When I asked her about what came in a gordita she would run back to the cook and ask him. Happened twice. They need their staff to be \u00a0pretty efficient with their menu, not just hire plane Jane of the street and tell her to wait tables.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 11, 19]}, "9": {"description": "What can I say?First the positives:This place has a nice decor and the \u00a0Deshebrada (Shredded Beef) was very good.That's it.I admit that their was some slight hype for this joint hell the day it opened it had a full mariachi and other things that made the whole reopening well festive that's right a reopening as it used to be on 5141 South Kedzie Avenue before moving to it's new home on 2423 51st St about two weeks ago. My family and I did not attend the grand re opening for a couple of reasons: the main one being that grand openings always sort of suck because they are always packed and \u00a0the service can be shoddy especially if it's a small or medium joint with a handful of tables and booths and let's be honest why go through all of that if the food is going to either suck or be below average? Then again if it's a knock out and the food kicks ass then I am the dumb ass with egg on my face but hey that's life.Well guess what guys I am not a dumb assBefore I start let me give you guys a brief rundown of what this joint is about in 5 fun and easy steps!1.They serve estilo Duranguense from the Mexican state of Durango which means you will see many dishes that you normally would not find in say a \"Comales\" or a \"Zacatacos\".2.Cheap Burritos between 2.50 and 2.993. Gorditas de harina (flour)4.Picadillo (minced meat with either green or red salsa)5. Dancing cooks and waitresses (OK I lied)So those are some quick facts and now to the review....When my family and I entered the place it was modestly packed and we had no issues finding a table to sit down and hopefully get the service that you would expect from good restaurants...well that suckedIt took at least 10 minutes before we had a waitress attend us and to make matters worse we had to deal with a filthy table that still had chips from the previous customers and not to mention a tip left for the waitress (about four bucks) and some other food related items on the table. Finally a waitress perhaps guided by her inexperience came to us and asked us if we are ready to order! Well we had no menus, old chips, and a dirty table in front of us so I guess NO! finally realizing the situation she went ahead and brought some menus took our drink orders and we figured that everything was going to be fine.Ah NO!After that ordeal we finally got a basket of war tortilla chips that where warm and delicious but then we tried the Salsa which was watery dull and flavorless and after a brief check up with the waitress she finally brought \u00a0us a thicker salsa that was tastier and spicier but still very boring. In the midst of all this we had already placed our orders and we waited and we waited and we waited..................... and then we waited a little more........... thirty minutes!!!!!!!!!! it was ridiculous it was like that scene from \"Casino\" remember when Joe Pesci had that guys head in a vice? yeah maybe I am taking that a little too far.So the food arrives! Hey remember the cheap burritos I was talking about? They \u00a0are nothing more than glorified \"giant tacos\" as opposed to regular burritos since they are not the same size as most other burrito joints. Take a regular sized or slightly bigger flour tortilla and add meat and cheese and then wrap it and then you get an idea of what I am talking about. However the best part about this is the fact that it featured some truly excellent Deshebrada that was the sole salvation of this place hence the two stars. I also ordered two tacos of tripitas (tripe) and they where completely average.Everyone else ordered one gordita,two tacos and two quesadillas and \u00a0they where all underwhelming with the big insult being that the gordita was lacking in meat and size and considering the price about 2.50 you would think they would fill it up but I guess this place does not care about portions.So recapping a little bit it was all what four tacos, one burrito, a gordita, and a quesadilla and that took 30 minutes? The general reaction amongst all of us was that the food was average and when you combine that with lackluster service and a dirty table and having to ask for napkins which should be a requirement for all eating establishments especially on the tables it's safe to say this place is terrible and want to know the final blow? taking into account all that we ordered which included some sodas and one large Horchata and an order of rice and beans the total tab was about 35+ dollars! \u00a0I personally believe that it's great in theory for La Placita de Durango to try and cook some would be inspired dishes from the Mexican state of Durango and considering the high amount of people here in Chicago that are actually from Durango it would have been great if they got a fair culinary representation but unfortunately La Placita de Durango is average at best and I don't think I will ever eat here again.

You had a great time, you're a little ashamed, and you definitely need a shower.For my non-Torta-eating friends, a Torta is the Mexican take on a sandwich. Meat, cheese, toppings, all sandwiched between grilled bread. You can order one at your local Mexican burrito place and it will probably be pretty tasty. Order one at this particular restaurant and it will blow your freaking mind.First, the Tortas here are Torta-zilla in scale. Massive. Think a large loaf of bread sliced in half. While the size will immediately wow you, it's nothing compared to the mind-blow you'll experience when you bite in. Do you like Mexican flavors? Imagine a buttered loaf of fresh bread, stuffed with pork shoulder, Carne Asada, grilled chicken, Chorizo, mango salsa, pineapple, or combinations of your favorite Mexican meats and flavors. Load it with gooey melted cheese, and then grill that bad-boy to crusty-bread perfection. It's Mexican flavor perfection on a roll. The sandwiches are soccer themed, named after famous players. The decor can only be described as no-frills rustic Mexican sandwich shop. Mexican soap operas blare on the TVs. Customers are local teenagers and blue collar workers that just got off shift. The servers all speak Spanish. In other words, amazing.

It is so spongy and underseasoned.Gotta give it to them, the arroz con leche is still good as well as their guayaba atole.but when it comes to tamales, I drive a little bit more to the next tamaleria.Manolo what happened to your tamales?????", "rating": "3", "date": [2012, 4, 9]}, "3": {"description": "This place is just ok. After reading all these raving reviews, my expectations where a bit higher. Prices for tamales are standard to other places. Like other reviews, I wish the tamales were spicer. I ordered the cheese and the chicken. I felt that the tamales needed more filling. There was barely any cheese in the tamale, mainly consisting of masa. The tamales were a bit bland and didn't have too much flavor.

I just purchased 1dozen this morning, and literally, all tamales only have 1 piece of meat! I even have a picture I wish I can post.. \u00a0I just called to complain and ask If I can return them and get my money back and they said no because I need my receipt. If I would have known this was going to happen I sure would have saved it! Plus I asked if they can check their debit/credit machine since I paid with my debit card and I can show them proof of purchase and they did not accept that.. I also bought half dozen 1 week and a half ago and the tamales were not done yet. when you opened them, all the tamale fell apart because they were all mushy!!! This place was the best and their tamales were always delicious, I don't know whats going on with them now.. unfortunately, they have lost one client here!", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 11, 13]}, "18": {"description": "I live in Evanston and I would not go anywhere else for tamales. I was just there this past weekend and got a dozen Oaxaqueno tamales. I have tried all their tamales, but those are my favorites. \u00a0They open up very early, so I was there to get tamales by 8:00 AM on a Sunday and thought I may as well get some breakfast too. I ordered the Steak Quesadilla and it was incredibly good. For $4 you get a Quesadilla made in a buritto sized tortilla and a very generous portion of grilled steak \u00a0piled inside. \u00a0It also comes with a side of sour cream, a side of Guacamole, and lettuce and tomato. I will agree that there is just a bit of a wait for the food, but just have a seat and watch the Mexican Music Videos on the television above the counter. The food is well worth waiting a few minutes. \u00a0Just writing about it makes me want to make another stop there this weekend.", "rating": "5", "date": [2010, 7, 7]}, "13": {"description": "Please come here if you want to be ashamed of something.I remember this place when it first opened up. \u00a0I really like supporting local businesses and prefer giving them my money rather than going to any chain. \u00a0I've always thought the food here was pretty good and was glad to have another taqueria that's even closer to my house.Until:I walked in, asked for a torta and was told they ran out of the torta bread.Came again, asked for tacos de asada and was told they had no more meat.Visited again and was told they ran out of the burrito tortillas.Saw the lady cook eating her lunch all sloppily at the counter and then proceeded to walk into the back to start cooking without washing her hands.I've frequented other businesses MUCH busier than this place and *they* NEVER run out of ingredients. \u00a0I will admit that the food is pretty tasty, the salsa is better than a lot of places, BUT they truly have no excuse for much of the sloppiness and inadequacy plaguing this taqueria.UPDATE: came back for redemption visit (or because I'm a masochist). \u00a0It was so nice and refreshing to see that things don't change. \u00a0The cook in the back had (and I'm not exaggerating) a volleyball size chunk of round frozen meat that she was trying to defrost and cook at the same time as she was picking it apart with a spatula. \u00a0No hair net, no apron, no gloves, and a pair of lovely flip flops.", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 1, 28]}, "4": {"description": "This tamales are the bomb, not to mention the oaxaque\u00f1os.

This year was a mess! I ordered both meat and non meat tamales (for my vegetarian guests.)Well as it turns out I was given someone else's order that did not contain any non meat tamales, therefore I had nothing to serve my vegetarian guests. Not to mention I ordered more tamales than the order that I received. \u00a0Since they are all mixed up on a aluminum tray you can't tell what is what beforehand. I couldn't do anything about it since it was late on Christmas Eve. I tried calling immediately after the holiday and was told by a woman named Olga (who left me on hold for over 10 min ) that I would have to talk to the owners, whom where not present. I called for 2 weeks about every other day and they were never available. I left my number with the same woman, Olga several times and have yet to receive a call back. I finally gave up! The tamales have changed this year not sure if they were less of quality due to the massive orders and the customer service is horrible therefore will not ever be ordering tamales from here again nor will my friends or family.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 1, 8]}, "7": {"description": "My favorite spot to get tamales in the south side.
