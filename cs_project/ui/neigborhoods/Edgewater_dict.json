I was like, that's lighting fast service, only to wait another 10 mins or so before our food came.So the hotcakes were super fluffy layered w/warm blackberries & vanilla mascarpone cream, & topped w/a brown sugar & oat crust. You can totally eat this sans syrup with the delicious berry sauce that gives it the perfect hint of sweetness. Of course I got a side of candied applewood bacon as a savory item to go with it. It's a delicious sticky mess, but I wish it was a tad bit more crunchy. Nonetheless, still good. The house baked cinnamon roll dressed with warm fruit, vanilla neufchatel creme was also topped with a granola crust. It wasn't overly sweet and the mixture of textures was lovely.A very good breakfast option in the Andersonville/Edgewater area.

There is also a register all the way at the back of the shop, which is largely obscured by wine shelves; on several occasions, while trying to purchase something at the front counter, I've been redirected to the back register where -- in theory -- it will be quicker to check out. Unfortunately, the folks at the front counter can't really see how many people are lined up at the back register, and today I once again found myself in a line four-deep at the latter, which wasn't moving at all because the person at the front of the line wanted to ask the person on the register everything about everything. After ten minutes of that, I eventually just went back to the front register and waited another five minutes to pay for my purchase there; if the items hadn't been things I needed for tonight's dinner, I would have just left without them.Again, I like this place, and love their bread, cheese and wine selection.

We did not have cash so my sister dug through her coin purse and had $1.50. When she asked to see which photos she wanted to put back, he replied, \"Sorry Its 7:15, I can't ring you out. We're closed. You can come back tomorrow and buy them.\" And then we awkwardly just walked out in shock. So my sister dug through the piles of photos (that no one probably wants) \u00a0all for nothing.

After doing some much needed grocery shopping, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in here to see if there was anything we liked. We had been in a few times before and had always had good experiences. We had wandered around the store for over 15 minutes with our big bags of groceries, and we had even seen two employees there who acknowledged us. When I walked over to the shoe aisle, I left my BLACK boyfriend waiting for me in the main aisle. As he walked over to talk to me an employee came by and nervously asked him if he was shopping???? Why else would we be in there? When he replied yes, the employee asked him to check his bag. Overhearing all of this, and carrying a bag of my own, we both walked over to the front desk to follow the store policy and check our bags. When we walked up we placed our bags on the counter, the employee looked confused and said to me, oh you don't need to check your bag, its just a purse. Mind you my bag was very obviously a cloth shopping bag full of the same groceries my boyfriend had in his bag AND I had an actual purse slung visually over my shoulder. Sensing there was some prejudice here I responded that this is my purse and this is my bag full of groceries, and since the policy is to check your bags I was bringing mine to be checked with my boyfriends, he still seemed confused, and I realized he didn't even think my boyfriend and I were together, so I told him so, and then I asked him to check our bags together. At the time I was holding an adorable little sailor lamp that I wanted to use in our apartment for my redecoration, I am building an entire room to commemorate my BLACK boyfriends 8 YEARS IN THE NAVY, and his numerous medals and achievements. It would have been perfect. He then asked if we wanted to get the lamp, we said yes but that we were still shopping. What? do you not remember asking us to come up to check our bags? Or were you just so ready for us to check out and get our biracial asses out the store? I said I wanted to buy it later and he said ok you can leave it here. He seemed nervous and awkward. The whole experience had thrown me off and felt slightly prejudice, why would my boyfriends bag of groceries not be ok, but my bag of groceries is ok?? Why? Because I look white? I tried to let it go, my boyfriend wanted me to let it go, so we walked back towards the rear to the look at the furniture. Upon passing NUMEROUS people with empty bags I became infuriated. There was an old white woman with a grey bob haircut and an EMPTY yellow shopping bag wandering around that no one had said anything to. Then there was ANOTHER WOMAN with an empty brown bag wandering around. Why had these people not been asked to check their bags? I wanted to leave, I went back up to the counter and I wanted my bags back. I explained that there seemed to be some prejudice since there was a white woman wandering with her bags unchecked. The man responded that he couldn't check everyone. Well sir, if you can come find my BLACK boyfriend to tell him to check his bag full of groceries, and you DONT want to be perceived as racist, MAYBE you should take the time to go look around at the entire store, you know, just so you don't make anyone feel singled out. Then he told me to go get the white woman! NO, YOU GO GET HER. You had enough time to find my boyfriend and get him, now you don't have enough time to tell the white woman to check her bag? Are you insinuating that Im lying??? I don't fucking work here, Im not the one policing the bags, or is it just the black men you police? And when I told him it felt like he had singled my boyfriend out, his response was that they were the least prejudiced people around, still not getting my bag for me. I told him it didn't seem that way. I continued to ask for my bag and he continued to ramble off stuttering excuses and reasons why he was not prejudiced, all while not getting the bag I asked for. I ignored him and continued to ask for my bag. As we went to leave he said \"whatever,\" to our backs. Yes, a real professional way to handle a disgruntled customer. My advice is this, if you don't want someone to feel singled out, then take the time to make sure they don't, I don't know, maybe by asking EVERY SINGLE PERSON to leave their bags at the front. Your not Saks, if you have a store policy you want upheld, then have someone always at the front to make sure it is being upheld, because the two other employees we walked by with our big bags of groceries said NOTHING to us. I am all for following rules, my father is a sergeant and my boyfriend is a veteran, but I am not about to let someone be subconsciously racist and not get called out on it. My boyfriend deserves an apology. We don't need to steal, we followed your rules, you singled us out, we voiced our feelings and you took an extremely unprofessional way out.

If you are looking for some particular type of European pastry in Chicago, this is probably the place to start. On my last visit, I tried both their version of the Swedish \"semla\" and the Polish equivalent, the \"paczki\". The semla was good, but unfortunately, it did not contain enough almond creme for my taste. It was also served in a strange paper cup. This is not the traditional way of serving a semla. Nonetheless, the semla would still be slightly above average compared to the ones you can find in Sweden.Where the Swedish Bakery really shines is with regards to the cookies. They sell a large number of traditional Swedish cookies by the pound. In many other places, these kinds of cookies are often quite dry and uninspiring. I am happy to report that this is not the case here! I tried about 7 different varieties, and all were very well made. The butter-to-sugar ratio was just right. As some other reviewers have noted, many of their products contain, or rather, consist of, marzipan. This may seem unappealing to many American consumers. But keep in mind that marzipan is to Europeans as peanut butter is to Americans. They put it on essentially everything! In addition, Scandinavian pastries are often less sweet than the American counterparts. As a result, you will not find many of the \"large-size, extra cream, extra fudge\" kind of treats that you might be used to.

Special order of a marzipan cake with raspberry filling and chocolate cake. It was picked up March 21.The marzipan filling was dry and chewy, the cake was dry and was not chocolate, there was whip cream covering the outside of the cake, then it was covered in marzipan fondant. It was horrible. Not a tasty cake. It was difficult to cut as the marzipan fondant was dry and chewy. Tasted like hard paste with almond extract. Not authentic marzipan cake at all. We left a vm but have yet to hear back. The cake sits in the refrigerator as I am not dashing to eat it because the flavors and fillings are the worst! The pink flowers on the cake are hard and dry. This cake was not fresh at all.Unhappy!Owner wrote and only agreed to voucher $10.00 of items at the bakery, no refund- cake was over $25.00. TipAsk whats on a cake even if you special order it. There was whip cream under the chewy marzipan. I am allergic to whip cream. The cake basically was... Crap!It's prolly best just to order a cake that they are famous about. I am not sure what cake as I didn't order the cake. It was a surprise!A bad surprise. Since, no monetary refund was offered. I suggest asking what the polices before buying anything from this establishment. Also, ask for cake eating instructions, as that is what the owner stated.

STEWS - Most of these are traditional and you should as a Filipino friend what they are. \u00a0Nothing will be too hot or spicy, just different.Adobo is combination of chicken and pork (there they go again, trying to marry the meats together) cooked in soy sauce, garlic, black pepper, bay leaves and vinegar. \u00a0The richness of the pork and the lightness of the chicken make for a nice tasty dish. \u00a0Pancit noodles are an egg noodle frenzy of chinese pork sausage, pork and chicken (see dat again?), carrots, celery and mushrooms in a rich oyster sauce flavor. \u00a0Excellent carb that is also served with white rice (you will find that almost everything in a Filipino diet is served with white rice).BREADS - If you like soft, roll type bread, try the pan de leche or the pan de sal. \u00a0Both are great. \u00a0The other products within the store are catered toward the Filipino community. \u00a0Everything is in english and you should find no problem with any of the selections.

The flavor is exceptional, and is intensified with a nice, slightly thickened beef jus.These people know how to do beef. \u00a0The burgers are outstanding. \u00a0If you know the difference in an excellent burger, and a very good burger, you'll know how rare this is. \u00a0Ha. \u00a0I said rare.And they know how to do pulled pork. \u00a0This isn't a barbecue place that reeks of smoke like a proper \"BBQ\", but their pulled pork sandwich is tender and has a wonderful sauce that's a perfect balance of spicy, sour, and sweet.The Bread Pudding is perhaps the best I've had. \u00a0The apples are soft but still retain their shape. \u00a0The pudding itself is a country style, with larger bite sized pieces of bread. \u00a0But the miracle of this bread pudding is the caramel sauce. \u00a0No, it's not like any caramel sauce you've had. \u00a0You won't find it on ice cream or on an apple pie and certainly not in a store. \u00a0The sugar base is caramelized to a very dark color before being thinned to a perfect sauce consistency. \u00a0It's heaven.One of the newer items, the Tempura Fried Brussels Sprouts, is a delicious, but quite rich appetizer. \u00a0Order them, and plan on sharing them. Maybe even among three people. \u00a0The Wasabi dipping sauce absolutely makes the dish, but does not overpower the flavor of the sprouts.The ambiance of the restaurants feels more comfortable than uppity, and somewhat utilitarian and dated. This restaurant is not trying to impress you with its decor, although it is perfectly welcoming. \u00a0Table placement is somewhat close, and the restaurant is well illuminated at night. \u00a0I would not call it especially romantic.

We ordered the Tempura Broccoli as an appetizer on the server's recommendation. \u00a0Personally, I found it much too thick on the tempura. \u00a0The wasabi dipping sauce is definitely an acquired taste and I really wish they offered a different option. \u00a0Like something more in the soy dept. \u00a0Anyhow, after a few pieces, I just was pealing off the tempura and eating the broccoli by itself. \u00a0For dinner, it seems I was the only one that really was satisfied with the selection - which was on the special menu called Paul's Pasta (or was it Pete's, whatever it was, I did enjoy the fresh tasting pasta that had a light Alfredo coating - lots of other ingredients like onion and zucchini in it, but honestly can't remember all of them except it was pretty darn good.). \u00a0A couple of our dining companions had appetizers for dinner - one being the muscles from the specials menu and he complained they were a bit gritty. \u00a0The other ordered the \"Cape Henry Crab Cakes\" (which I sampled) and both of us thought they were way too heavy on the bread and neither could find or taste the crab. \u00a0Hey, if you are that low on crab, just take it off the menu. \u00a0And the fourth had the flatbread, which she was disappointed in mostly because she could not customize the ingredients. \u00a0Apparently they are made ahead of time so, special orders are not possible. \u00a0I may have given this 3 stars if I just had the main course alone and if the service was a little more expedient (it wasn't that busy so not sure what was going on there.)I think I should have just rested on my fond previous memories of this place.", "rating": "2", "date": [2016, 2, 6]}, "39": {"description": "I took a friend for Sunday brunch and was certainly glad I made reservations.

Four days later, after the points never showed up, I was told by the owner, Barbara, that it would not be able to be fixed.

Admittedly, it gained 2 stars from me only because I couldn't give it the 1.5 it deserved.I noticed this little hole-in-the-wall shop while I was walking down Broadway near my apartment. I returned with some friends recently to check it out, and was seriously disappointed when I did.The shop is small, barely bigger than the size of my front room. Seemingly, the smallest section of the shop is dedicated to actual comics -- only one wall is dedicated to the three shelving units of single issues, and another on the opposite wall for indie comics. Looking over what little selection they did have on hand, I noticed that most of the comics were not anywhere near current. The largest section of the shop is up front near the door, which doesn't work properly by the way, where the few patrons other than me and my friends were sitting around in some bizarrely-fashioned reading section.We were there for over 30 minutes, and one of my friends had an entire 5-book run of comics in hand to buy, and yet no one said anything to us since we had entered. The staff on hand, which consisted of either 2 or 6 people -- I couldn't tell which, since those in question were all just standing around talking to each other near the register -- were your stereotypically overweight, neck-beard, fanboys who were all wearing varying degrees of Batman paraphernalia.We exited the shop without buying the comics, which was a good choice in my opinion, as I would be hard pressed to give this establishment any of my hard-earned money. I would be willing to pay the $2.25 to take the Red Line to Belmont and walk 15 minutes to the vastly superior Chicago Comics on Clark and School, or, begrudgingly, to Graham Cracker Comics on Broadway and Belmont.I would say that I am surprised Third Coast Comics is still in business, but with it being the only comic shop around, its unfortunately not hard to see why.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 10, 10]}, "16": {"description": "I can't say enough good things about this shop. \u00a0A comic shop can be an intimidating place for a woman who never read comics before but Terry has no problem getting you caught up or suggesting a great graphic novel based on the books or TV shows that you like. \u00a0He also hosts monthly meet ups, which are a great place to meet cool Chicago geeks and catch up on pop culture (and drink some beers). \u00a0Third Coast also gives 10% discount to Edgecard holders, so what are you waiting for?", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 8, 4]}, "17": {"description": "Fantastic comic book shop in Edgewater. \u00a0Well organized with a very friendly owner. \u00a0They also host events from time to time which you can find out about on their website.One caveat is they don't seem to stock back issues. \u00a0I'm a trades reader so this isn't a problem for me at all.I really hope Edgewater embraces this place.", "rating": "5", "date": [2008, 11, 14]}, "15": {"description": "Stopped in on a Sunday.

What could make a grocery store smell like pee right by the produce and dry goods section? \u00a0And not near any bathroom I could see?My first thought was, \"Oh, they must let a cat patrol or something at night. It's a city, there's probably mice and rats and that's what cats are supposed to do as working animals: control rodents.\" \u00a0I'm actually ok with this.But the more I thought about it, I realized with our modern health code cats likely aren't allowed either, and the store was dingy enough that while I'm cool with a patrolling cat, you should also be using other measures too. And a good cat shouldn't pee outside of their box. (I know they do, particularly males, but I'd think if you were using a cat as rodent patrol, you'd replace it until you found one that didn't do that in a food store.)And I don't know if it was cat pee. \u00a0It could be rat pee. \u00a0Or mouse. \u00a0Or heck, human. My nose isn't exactly an expert on determining species from the smell of pee.So experiencing this really bothers me, particularly inside a grocery store. \u00a0I've been to Edgewater Produce and Skokie's Marketplace on Oakton, both of which ALSO specialize in fresh produce and/or ethnic foods. \u00a0Neither have ever smelled of pee.

We wanted to head out as not to keep the staff past closing, but they heard we were celebrating a birthday and brought us tiramisu with a candle and sang happy birthday in Italian.

Since the place is BYOB, and always has been, they decided to start charging a corkage fee (the server said they started it about a year ago). This is not stated on their website, which is frustrating. We had a table of six on Saturday night, so had a couple bottles of wine with us. They then stated that they charge per bottle as well, not just a one time fee for corkage. It is $15 per normal sized bottle, and $20 per larger bottle. I understand restaurants needing to do this since they are BYOB, but let's not get carried away now.

Haven't been in for a while but always liked it because the pizza was excellent, they were BYOB and they were usually not too crowded. The staff was always pleasant, the owner slung pizza in the back, always visited the tables to check on patron's meals. After having not been in over a year we came in tonight and brought some beer. We learned that they now had wine (fairly expensive) and beer (crap and Italian). We also couldn't get a straight answer about the fees to bring our own, other than an exorbitant $15 corkage fee for wine. Turns out there was a $3 per beer fee. We ordered, we ate, it was all very quick because that's how you go to restaurants when you have a 2-year-old. He was well-behaved, he wasn't screaming or yelling, he wasn't walking around, he wasn't throwing stuff. I'm not one of those halfwits who thinks their child doesn't misbehave, or who thinks every scream and yell should be recorded for posterity because it's so precious. But my son was not misbehaving. Towards the end of the meal, as we waited for a rather long time for them to take our check and give us change our son started to get antsy. He yelled a few times, so my wife took him out of his chair and he walked towards the front door where he stood waving goodbye to people, or rather persons because the place was pretty empty. In fact he waved goodbye to two people who left. At this time the owner was standing at the hostess station, leaning on it, looking not amused because a child was standing there really doing nothing. He frankly looked pretty annoyed. He was wincing like he was getting a rectal exam actually. My son let out a few more yells and that's when the owner decided that he needed to tell us that we need to keep our child quiet, because people were trying to enjoy their meal. He had made a few noises, I didn't see anyone complain and I think I would have known because there were only two other occupied tables and one of them also had a young child at their table. So my wife picked our son up and told the owner that we were just trying to pay our check, and the owner kept hounding us about keeping our son quiet. Again, I'm not some halfwit who can't recognize when my child is misbehaving. I'm not the kind of idiot who would bring a toddler to Alinea, or any kind of fancy, quiet restaurant. But this place has many high chairs, and often has many kids in the restaurant when we have been in the past. I'm not sure if business is bad and the owner just feels like being a smug dick to everyone, but that's what we experienced tonight and it was unfortunate, because I would tell anyone I knew about how great their brick-oven pizza was, how it wasn't anywhere near as crowded as some of the other brick-oven places in Chicago, how they were BYOB and it was a very casual, friendly environment. So in closing a big F you to the prick owner of this place, who is shown in the foreground of at least one of the photos on the Yelp review. Don't go here if you have kids who make a few noises during dinner because you'll incur the wrath of an asshole who seems mad that his restaurant isn't very full, or that people don't want to spend way too much money on his wine and bad beer.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 6, 22]}, "21": {"description": "This is one of those reviews that I'm afraid to write.

Oh, let me count the ways.First, the service is OUTSTANDING. I mean, really, they fawn over you. The waitstaff is professional and kind and efficient. My mom dropped something out of her purse while we were dining there today, and our waiter came over to pick it up before she even had a chance to bend over.Also, Mario, the owner, is always there.

It really feels like a family-owned neighborhood restaurant.But the food, of course, is the real star. The pizza, which is fired in their large pizza oven, is my favorite in the city. The crust is thin and floppy, the edges are blistered, and the toppings are fresh.They also have the best Italian salads and pastas I've had in the city.

Oh, let me count the ways.First, the service is OUTSTANDING. I mean, really, they fawn over you. The waitstaff is professional and kind and efficient. My mom dropped something out of her purse while we were dining there today, and our waiter came over to pick it up before she even had a chance to bend over.Also, Mario, the owner, is always there. He will great you with a smile and a buttery Italian accent as soon as you walk in the door, and he'll make sure you've had a good time.The vibe of the restaurant is cozy and homey and oh-so-welcoming. It really feels like a family-owned neighborhood restaurant.But the food, of course, is the real star. The pizza, which is fired in their large pizza oven, is my favorite in the city. The crust is thin and floppy, the edges are blistered, and the toppings are fresh.They also have the best Italian salads and pastas I've had in the city.

Their ice cream tastes so good. They have so many flavors! Their sundaes are so childishly sinful and delicious. BUT ..... but, every single time, without fail, both my boyfriend and I feel unbelievably sick after eating their ice cream. Like, TMI sick. Get it? Immediate punishment. This is no good!I went here with 2 of my aunts once and they immediately commented on the old milk smell in the parlor and it is so true. There is a SMELL for sure in here. It's stale milk and refrigerator smell. It's so bad that you can smell it OUTSIDE the parlor, leaking through the door. It's nauseating. Am I getting sick because their ice cream is old, bad, spoiled, not stored at the proper temperature? I don't know. I will say many times the ice cream has been basically dripping melting the second they put it on a cone. Maybe they aren't keep their cooler/fridges at the right temp.An even bigger complaint than getting continually sick from their ice cream and a sign that something huge is wrong with their refrigerators is the taste of their refrigerated treats/baked goods. \u00a0One day I wanted some chocolate, not ice cream, and I remember George's has some such items along with cake and what not. I purchased a small baggie of foam candy, I think it's called Devil's food candy in some parts. It's caramelized foamy sugar in chunks, covered in chocolate. The sugar is delicious and dissolves in your mouth, or so it is supposed to. I got these bad boys home and took one bite and could not eat anymore. The taste of old fridge had so intensely permeated these treats that I could not eat another bite and threw them away. How old are these candies? When were they made? If they are fresh, when is the last time you cleaned out your fridge units?!??!?! With a taste like that I am absolutely 100% certain that absolutely all of their candies, cakes, chocolates also taste like fridge. And because this parlor continually smells stale I have to confidently assume their baked goods and treats ALWAYS taste like old, stale fridge. The taste was so god awful inedible, old and terrible. Yikes. I was so close to going back to return these disgusting treats but I just let it go because I didn't feel like losing it in public and yelling at hipsters about chocolate.

Their service alone won me over. Another huge plus is that they are not underemployed. The line moves fast even though it looks long. I got 2 scoops of \"Heaps of love\" with Oreo, Nuts, and M&M toppings. It was good but, their scoops are SMALL. Something to note is that they keep rotating their ice cream flavors.

She's a very personable person, she's quick with a smile, and she seems to really enjoy letting people know about her farm, the vegetables, and, the most interesting part, the yarn. Her farm has sheep and she creates skein's of wool that she hand-spins. She leaves the wool in its natural shades, and it's amazing the variety of shades the wool naturally comes in. She also dyes some of them using flowers, plants, etc, creating beautiful colors. Another great thing about Vera's stand are the smells! She's got cinnamon basil, lavender, and other things that smell so good. I felt like I was transported to the farm in Michigan. Part of what I enjoy about going to my local farmers' market is the opportunity to socialize and to interact with vendors. Vera, of Videnovich Farms, really seems to have quite a flair for talking with market goers with a friendly demeanor and a knack for providing information about her wares.

This is really wonderful especially for people who work full-time during the week. This market features a myriad of produce items, many kinds of breads and excellent meat vendors. This Farmer's Market features a rotation of vendors (merchants), which s a great way to give new vendors an opportunity to participate every other week. You will see items, such as, baked goodies and fresh real fruit jams. Due to the \"rotation\" of vendors (merchants) you may not see a specific vendor the following week. One vendor that I was very happy to see this year was \"Black Garlic North America\" which offers aged, fermented garlic which has a sweet, delicate taste and balances most dishes perfectly. I love using this garlic in different meats as well as using it sparingly in salads, grilled salmon or broiled Talapia. I also purchased some organic vegetables and fruits. I even found corn, which is very hard to find at a Farmer's Market. Picked up a few ears for my husband who loves corn on the cob. This Farmer's Market is open through October 15, 2014 and every Wednesday from 3 to 7 pm. Gotta love it!Due to \"space\" this is not a huge Farmer's Market, however, it has some wonderful items. I like the size of this market, because it doesn't take long to get through the entire market and hit up most of the vendors here. I have been to many, many Farmer's Market over the years and most close by early afternoon. On the other hand, this Farmer's Market is open until 7 or 8 pm (depending upon the day of the week and time of month). This year the market opened two-weeks early, which was very exciting for those of us who enjoy a great Farmer's Market. There are nearly 30 vendors offering everything from fresh-cut flowers, wonderful bottles of wine to a myriad of cheese to honey and including fresh lamb, delicious ripe fruits and unique vegetables. If you enjoy tea in the fall and winter time (or year round) you must check out the gourmet tea vendors. There are pies, gourmet pasta sauce and unique salsas that you may not find any where else. I noticed some people brought their knives (yes, you heard correctly) -- knives -- and someone will sharpen your knives for FREE while you walk around the Farmer's Market and shop till you drop!I met Brady Bradine at the Farmer's Market. This is his fourth year being a vendor at the market. He sells all-natural, whole grain baked goods, which I can appreciate but can no longer eat. For example, Brady sells cookies, cupcakes, muffins and brownies from his bakery located in Oak Park, IL (it is called \"B True Bakery\"). I didn't purchase any items from the \"B True Bakery\" but my friend purchased a cupcake and cookie for her husband. I gave up sweets and anything that contains sugar, but I do admit my mouth was watering and everything looked fantastic and smelled super fresh. My friend rated the cupcake with 4-stars (as she ate it while we were walking around the market). Her husband enjoyed the cookie and said it was \"very, very good.\" He didn't rate the cookie. However, he inhaled the cookie very quickly so I will take this to mean that maybe the cookie was/is 4 or 5-star worthy.If you have not been to a Farmer's Market this Summer, get your ass over to Berwyn Avenue (between Clark and Ashland Avenue) and treat yourself. This is their sixth year. I love a good Farmer's Market, and appreciate that they also offer organic products that will not break your budget. I also appreciate that they accept credit cards, debit and LINK cards which makes it very convenient for everyone to shop at this Farmer's Market. Some of the other Farmer's Market that I have shopped at this Summer are \"cash only\" but not the Andersonville Farmer's Market. Out of all the Farmer's Market that I have been to this Summer this is one of my favorite markets.

The second time we came here, he came for the flan, and me still feeling weak, didn't want to risk trying it just yet, so I ordered a small box of the congri, which seemed safe to me. OMG, the rice is delicious! I immediately asked Kenny if he can learn how to make it so that he can make it for me at home. Haha.

While LA UNICA certainly has a lot of diverse Latin American dishes, I have to say not all of them are great. For example, some of the people in my group ordered the jibarito \u00a0( a Puerto Rican Plantain sandwich) (and gave me a tiny bit to sample) my thoughts?it was just not very flavorful..no sight of the garlic and the meat was totally unseasoned, guess I will go to my reg. place on Fullerton Ave for my jibarito fix. However, the Peruvian dish I ordered, Ceviche de Pollo was quite tasty. So I guess some of the dishes are just hit or misses. They do seem to have a lot of orders for delivery and take-out so clearly they have established themselves within the community and must be doing something right. I was slightly disappointed at the customer service as they seemed to be overly preoccupied (went around 6 pm on a weekday) and not really acknowledging our needs (napkins, utensils, to-go containers when we were done).We had to hound them for these things and it was hard to get their attention because there were not alot of them (2) and both seemed busy with the to-go orders. I have mixed reviews about this place and your experience will probably depend on what time of the day you go. The only thing that I will mention is that their coffee is STRONG..which is exactly what I needed..although they served it in a small styrophone cup with no lid...(not good if you are accident prone like me) the coffee certainly had that wake you up jolt I was looking for.

Then a friend of mine texted me about this great pan-Latin restaurant she had gone to near her apartment. \u00a0She mentioned that it was inside of a grocery, which may be off-putting to some, but intriguing to me. (Some of the best food comes from the most random places.) So I did a quick yelp search and found that they serve Cuban food, so it was game on from there--had to get there that night or else.My friend and I hightailed it to La Unica from Boystown, arriving literally 15 minutes before closing. \u00a0I was glad to find that they have a parking lot, which you never find on the north side. We made a bee line towards the restaurant, and the server was nice enough to take our order, even though they were clearly cleaning up for the night. We were presented with an expansive pan-Latin menu including Mexican, Colombian, and Cuban (score!!!) dishes, all listed in Spanish. \u00a0Good thing I had yelped the menu ahead of time, otherwise I would have had to ask my friend to translate. I ordered to oxtails of course, and substituted the yuca with the fried plantains. The meal came with steamed rice and black beans. The whole meal was only $8.95 + tax. \u00a0The oxtail stew at my LA restaurant is upwards of 13 bucks (well worth it, but seriously?!?!), so I knew I was on to something. \u00a0My friend ordered the chicken enchiladas verdes. Unfortunately, the credit card machine wasn't working, so we ordered at the restaurant counter but had to pay at the store counter (no big deal).We waited about 10 minutes, and the server brought our food out. Man oh man! What a feast. The plate was overflowing with savory goodness. I had four oxtails, half a plate of rice, a bowl of black beans, and about 4 slices of fried plantains. \u00a0The oxtails had a good meat-to-fat ratio, fall off the bone tender. \u00a0The sauce/gravy was incredibly flavorful, and was perfectly sopped up by my white rice. The black beans were equally delicious. \u00a0The plantains did leave something to desired--not the sticky, caramelized morsels I'm used to (they weren't as ripe as they could be), but edible. \u00a0I gobbled up the whole plate, like a true glutton, and had a great night's sleep because of it.I've been back to La Unica once for the oxtails since then, and look forward to introducing others to this hidden gem.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 1, 26]}, "20": {"description": "I have gone here with my family since I was a kid, my family is Cuban and let me tell you this is some real Cuban cooking.

I've been to Kopi several times over the past year (2013-2014) without updating my review. Until now. Each time I've visited Kopi, the quality of food and service have been hit-or-miss. I've been going to Kopi for 20 years, so I was willing to overlook a few mediocre experiences. After years and years of enjoying Kopi's food, service, and atmosphere, I have a history with this business. It's like an old friend. Sometimes that friend is a little moody, but you forgive her and continue with the friendship. There comes a time, though, when that friend abuses the relationship so much, you have to say good-bye forever. That time has come for me and Kopi.The atmosphere is still good. When I went in for breakfast recently, I noticed that some updating had been done, but it still held the same artsy vibe it always had. I sat down and was quickly given menus and waters for two, since I told the waiter I was waiting for a friend. When the friend arrived, she and the waiter exchanged a friendly hug and familiar greetings. Clearly, she'd been going to Kopi even more than I had, over the years.Despite that friendly greeting, once we ordered and received the food, the waiter disappeared. Not in a Halloween-type way, like vanished into a puff of smoke. No, he hung around the bar area, he chatted with another employee, he went into the back for some mysterious purpose. He never checked with us on our food, never refilled coffee or tea, just never did much waiter service at all. There were only three other tables occupied while we were there. It's not like he was so busy.Then there's the food. I ordered a tofu scramble with vegetables for $6.95. I got a tiny soup cup -- you know the kind, what you get when you order a cup of soup in a restaurant instead of a bowl? -- of entr\u00e9e, and a piece of French bread. That's it. That wasn't even appetizer size. I also ordered the vegetarian sausage. For $3.00, I got three over-cooked pieces of something, each of which was the size of a silver dollar. For $3.00. There were so hard, the tines of my fork actually bent trying to pick one up. I tried eating it just by putting it in my mouth. Burned. Dry. That was $10.00 worth of breakfast.My friend ordered a bagel and asked for extra cream cheese. She did get her bagel, and she did get the cream cheese. The waiter gave her two packets, charging her $.75 for each. She didn't know about the charge until we looked at the check.I was still hungry at the end of breakfast. I saw a treat in the counter, a peanut butter/chocolate muffin. That was $5.50. I scarfed it down on the walk to the car, because I was still so hungry. With tip, I ended up paying $20.00 for a poorly-cooked, tiny portion breakfast. $20.00!! \u00a0I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you, the tofu scramble and sausage were not enough to feed your 3-year-old. You get a small amount of mediocre food for high prices.No more second chances, Kopi. It took a year of bad experiences, but now, after this final visit, I'm done. From now on, it's M.

I had the Oregan Chai which was spiced nicely with Cinnamon and others. My friend had the Peppermint Latte which tasted like a melted down Peppermint Patty! It wasn't too sweet, but it had a more authentic mint taste than other lattes. The menu offers all day breakfast, soups, sandwiches, appetizers, and salads. Kopi offers a many deserts and pastries. I had the Challa French toast. Absolutely delightful! I asked the waitress to leave the maple syrup and the triple berry capote on the side so I could taste the bread on its own. My friend ordered the fluffy eggs with salmon and dill sour cream on multi grain bread. The sour cream pulled the dish together when spread on the bread and eaten with the eggs. A unique thing about Kopi is that there is one waitress that brings drinks and food to customers at tables. One does not go up and pick their food up from the counter like other cafes. The waitress also brings water and buses the table. Yet there is no expectation to tip him or her.

I've been to Kopi several times over the past year (2013-2014) without updating my review. Until now. Each time I've visited Kopi, the quality of food and service have been hit-or-miss. I've been going to Kopi for 20 years, so I was willing to overlook a few mediocre experiences. After years and years of enjoying Kopi's food, service, and atmosphere, I have a history with this business. It's like an old friend. Sometimes that friend is a little moody, but you forgive her and continue with the friendship. There comes a time, though, when that friend abuses the relationship so much, you have to say good-bye forever. That time has come for me and Kopi.The atmosphere is still good. When I went in for breakfast recently, I noticed that some updating had been done, but it still held the same artsy vibe it always had. I sat down and was quickly given menus and waters for two, since I told the waiter I was waiting for a friend. When the friend arrived, she and the waiter exchanged a friendly hug and familiar greetings. Clearly, she'd been going to Kopi even more than I had, over the years.Despite that friendly greeting, once we ordered and received the food, the waiter disappeared. Not in a Halloween-type way, like vanished into a puff of smoke. No, he hung around the bar area, he chatted with another employee, he went into the back for some mysterious purpose. He never checked with us on our food, never refilled coffee or tea, just never did much waiter service at all. There were only three other tables occupied while we were there. It's not like he was so busy.Then there's the food. I ordered a tofu scramble with vegetables for $6.95. I got a tiny soup cup -- you know the kind, what you get when you order a cup of soup in a restaurant instead of a bowl? -- of entr\u00e9e, and a piece of French bread. That's it. That wasn't even appetizer size. I also ordered the vegetarian sausage. For $3.00, I got three over-cooked pieces of something, each of which was the size of a silver dollar. For $3.00. There were so hard, the tines of my fork actually bent trying to pick one up. I tried eating it just by putting it in my mouth. Burned. Dry. That was $10.00 worth of breakfast.My friend ordered a bagel and asked for extra cream cheese. She did get her bagel, and she did get the cream cheese. The waiter gave her two packets, charging her $.75 for each. She didn't know about the charge until we looked at the check.I was still hungry at the end of breakfast. I saw a treat in the counter, a peanut butter/chocolate muffin. That was $5.50. I scarfed it down on the walk to the car, because I was still so hungry. With tip, I ended up paying $20.00 for a poorly-cooked, tiny portion breakfast. $20.00!! \u00a0I am not kidding or exaggerating when I tell you, the tofu scramble and sausage were not enough to feed your 3-year-old. You get a small amount of mediocre food for high prices.No more second chances, Kopi. It took a year of bad experiences, but now, after this final visit, I'm done. From now on, it's M.

She handed me my tea and told me the wrap would be ready shortly. Uh, ok..? I sat down and she immediately began sweeping up all around my table. The friendly guy behind the counter brought me my wrap. It was nicely grilled and assembled, but the turkey texture was spongy, like what you get from grocery store packages. The BBQ sauce was way too sweet, making the whole thing taste like some sort of bizarre take on horseradish candy.

I have a MA degree in Popular Culture studies, and while I concentrated on film and TV, many friends worked with comics and comic book history and culture. Here's the thing: because I didn't grow up with it, it has always been difficult to go to a store and be taken seriously, as: 1. I'm a woman. 2. I admit to being a comic novice. 3. Again, I'm a woman. 4. I'm not a huge fan of superhero-based content. AlleyCat has changed all that, and now that I'm 30, I have finally found a place where I am comfortable and feel welcomed and not ostracized. I had gone in a few times with my husband (a huge comic book fan) and was, as usual, completely overwhelmed and way out of my element. I finally went in by myself, in the hopes of being able to find something that I would enjoy that wasn't just something my husband or friends told me I had to try. I wanted to find what works for me. Nick not only helped me find material, but asked what sorts of TV and film I watch to better assess things that would be good starts for me to read. He never pushed something on me, and I don't even think he was sure I'd buy anything, but he did spend about 20 minutes with me and actually listened. As in, he didn't flinch when I said I was a newbie and felt overwhelmed and didn't know what the hell I was doing. Instead, he listened carefully to my list of favorite shows and films and carefully selected items for me. The experience was so positive for me that not only did I walk out with about $50 worth of books (because they looked perfect), but that someone finally cared about what I was interested in and invested time on a busy night to help me out. My husband is a loyal customer, but they found a loyal customer in me as well. I can't wait to go back in this week and discuss how I felt about the selections I went home with (Saga, Chew, Gotham Central, Black Science, and Scalped) to better learn where my tastes lie.Bottom line: these people are wonderful and beyond helpful. If you have ever been afraid of walking into comic book store, this is the one to break you from that fear.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 1, 11]}, "15": {"description": "This is my Neighborhood Comicbook Shop. I'm here once a week spending all my hard-earned money on comics (don't judge me). The customer service is tops. Don't know what you're looking for? They'll happily recommend something that you'll end up loving. Remember a book you saw a few months ago and it was blue and about a superhero? They'll find it or die trying. Want to put a few books aside to pick up later? I'm almost 100% sure they'll do that. In short, they're extremely nice, and extremely knowledgeable, and would even probably help you deliver your child if the timing was right.Another thing I like about this store is that all are welcome. For all the time I've spent there I've never once seen a customer make it in the shop without being warmly greeted. No one is ignored; no one is slighted, and let's face it, you can't say that about a lot of comic shops. You're not going to get dissed for liking Bat Mite, or laughed at for digging Greg Land's art, or any other comic-related offense. Alley Cat just doesn't have that vibe.The vibe it DOES have, is clean, tidy, and warm. You won't be tripping over boxes of random crap, or accidentally knocking books off the shelves because they've been there for months and have started to warp. You won't smell that musty moldering old-book smell present in some shops (sorry, places who still sport the carpet you had when your store opened 25 years-ago, but you know it's true), And you won't run out of things to peruse until long after your parking meter has expired (be careful, this has happened to me a few times already) because the place is packed with great stuff.Not only do they carry all the titles from your Marvels and DC's (and all their imprints), but they treat independent /alternative/smaller-press comics with the equal reverence. They've got a huge selection of trades and graphic novels as well as a great selection of various games (Magic gatherings also happen here weekly, so, you can do that), statues, figures, shirts, magazine, AND a great kid's section! Can you even believe it? So much stuff...it's pretty amazing.Lastly, the neighborhood. It's a walking neighborhood as well as a parking, shopping, and driving-away neighborhood. Starbucks, Potbellies, lot's of eateries and ice creameries, and shops are within footsteps of AlleyCat (which is hidden at the end of a small. but completely safe alley between Starbucks and Potbellies). The only downside is that in the summer on Wednesdays - that's \"comic book day\" for those that don't know - there's a stupid old farmer's market half a block away (just kidding, it's excellent). \u00a0that makes parking a bit harder to find. Not nearly impossible, just a bit harrowing if you're running out of gas. Still, worth it though. Finally, you should really support your local comic shop. If you haven't been comic shopping since you were a kid (like in the 90's, like Youngblood, am I right?), or you fell out of it because you thought you'd set aside childish things for a job and a car and kids, well, you should go back NOW. Things have changed. This is the titanium age of comics (I think I just made that up). The art.is literally better now than it's ever been. The stories are amazing and encompass every imaginable genre and subject (including zombies). Amazing artists and writers are being employed by comic companies (or starting their own) in incredible numbers, and it makes the comic experience so much more fulfilling. You should re-check it out.

Sweet cookies, but but not \"please-put-some-actual-flour-and-butter-in-this-cookie\" sweet. Ya get it? These are some good cookies. They make different flavors, and it looked like they had a PB&J cookie today, but I will probably stick with the triple chocolate chunk. -Pizza. As a red-blooded Midwestern American, it's vital that I get my daily recommended serving of pizza. I ordered the standard cheese pizza, and not only was it ready in a jiffy, but it was also a great classic New York style pie; thin, foldable crust, a slim layer of mild tomato sauce, and a sheet of browned cheese. I'm more of a deep dish gal, but this pizza did it for me. -Beverages. For its pseudo-divey atmosphere (intentional or not), there were some pretty great drink choices. I will refer to them as \"craft soft drinks\"; it's BYOB, so no craft beer here, but if \"craft soft drinks\" were a thing, that's what these would be. -Location: like I said, this place is close to where I live. It's right by the Broadway bus stop and pretty close to the El, so you have no excuses.

First off, we get there and we're greeted with that wholesome moldy smell I affectionately refer to as \"Ardmore\" that every business that has been run there can't seem to escape. If you've been around the neighborhood long enough, you'll know what I mean. My sis finds out she needs to make a cash run because they don't take cards. We head out, solve the problem, then go back in. The guy behind the counter welcomes us back. He had to have known that we were new customers, but he didn't bother to fill us in on the type of restaurant we'd gone into. If you're a laidback, self-service kind of place, I can dig it, it's just a little heads up would be nice. We sat waiting for service, and when we looked over to see if he was going to wait on us, he was chowing down on a huge piece of lettuce. Laughing a bit, we went up to the counter to place our order, because sure enough, you order at the counter. He was a little weird. I tipped because I tip, but he wasn't my kind of employee. He wasn't mean, or disrespectful, he was just weird. Anyhoo, we make our order, mine about $18. It's steep. We head back to the table. The service after this point was better. The food came and the portions made me feel a little better about the price. The pork belly was plentiful, but it was definitely missing something. The fries (the cashier assumed we wanted them, so we both wound up with them though there were other options for sides) were BANGIN'! They were thick-cut, skin on, and perfectly crisp on the outside with the right amount of fluff on the inside. They were the real MVP!!The sandwich was just chock full of meat. It needed something. More slaw, some bbq sauce, something. It was a bit bland and I was a little disappointed. I took about half of it home and it warms up very well. Definitely better the next day. I tried a little of my sis' pork shoulder and felt the same way. Good quality, well-cooked, but missing some oomph. The cookie was just meh. It tasted a little overdone. The bottom had burnt bits and it was cakey and dry on the inside. When I warmed it up at home the next day, it didn't soften like I expected. Also, it tasted like sugary breakfast cereal.

Instead of being there to celebrate with her, I found myself out-of-state in the hospital. To make matters worse, her birthday fell on a Sunday and, though i didn't expect to have them delivered on her birthday, i knew that if she got them on saturday, at least she could enjoy them on her birthday and know that i had thought enough of her to have the, delivered on Saturday. After reading several reviews, I called Anna Held As they were just down the street from my mother-in-law's apartment building and I like the idea of supporting a small independent florist instead of one of the national chains. I placed my order being careful to specify the address of the apartment building. I was a bit surprised that I was never asked for my mother-in-law's phone number, but I knew they had \u00a0my phone number so if there was a problem I knew that I would hear about it. When I called my mother-in-law on Sunday, from my hospital bed 1000 miles away, I was surprised that she didn't mention the flowers (but, I mean, she's 90) and called my husband to see if she had received them. \u00a0He quickly called the doorman who said that no flowers for her had been received all weekend. I called up my AmEx ill online and saw that I had indeed been charged for the flowers. I was furious. I tried calling the flower shop, but they weren't open at all on Sunday and wouldn't open until 10 o'clock Monday. At ten I had some procedures, so I didn't call until 12 noon on Monday. \u00a0When I told the person who answered the phone. Had ordered flowers that had not been delivered, she knew immediately who I was. She transferred me to someone who said she had tried to deliver them on Saturday, but there was no doorman at the building. I was struck by how the person immediately became defensive, saying several times that she had been to the building several times that day, but there was no doorman on the weekend, something that I happen to know is not true (they've lived there 12 years). \u00a0The address is similar to another building, and I suspect they went to the wrong building. My In-laws have a very common last name and the driver said she called two different people with that last name in the building and got no answer (my inlaws were home all day Saturday) and COMPLAINED that she didn't have the phone number which I was ever asked for. She DID have MY number which she could have called at any time and gotten the situation straightened out. What bothers me most is NOT that they made a mistake with the address and not even that I wasn't called, but the complete lack of humility, the lack of any genuine apology, and the litany of excuses rather than an real customer service. \u00a0She said at one point, dismissively,\"look, what's done is done\" and that they had a big wedding comIng up the next weekend. And then I had to call them at noon on Monday to find out that what I had paid for had not happened two days previously!I was asked, \"Do you want the (now two-day old) flowers delivered or not?\" When I asked if they were going to be the same two day old flowers, she tried to convince me they \"still looked nice\" which was not the point. \u00a0Fresh flowers have a very limited shelf life and now my mother-in-law was going to have 2 days less to enjoy them before they began to wilt. Not to mention this was a lot of money of m to spend and my mother in law will only turn 90 once and 90 year olds only have. limited number of birthdays left in them (though I suspect my MIL will be around for quite a while.)My husband says the flowers were delivered Monday and that the florist had added flowers, including orchids, to upgrade the arrangement . \u00a0He said that the arrangement \"looked like something may have fallen on it\" though the lack of any crushed flowers made him think that maybe it was just a more modern style of flower arranging.

After the wedding, I was able to enjoy my flowers for an additional week. The only very small criticism i have is that my bridesmaids bouquets wilted and bruised rather quickly.

The woman said I definitely could, and that they'd cluster three orchids together for each one. When I went to pick the corsages up, I noticed they looked really small and only had two orchids each.When I asked about it, the woman ringing me out immediately said I had received a deal on my corsages since they should've retailed for $35-40. And if I wanted to add another flower they would have to charge me more. I was really put off by this, because her tone implied that I had nickeled and dimed them. Basically, I was misquoted on the phone and to cover their end, they gave me less than what I was told.It's the business' responsibility to ensure their employees understand proper pricing, and if they don't it's not the customer's fault. The right thing to do would've been to call me when they realized the pricing discrepancy, and explained the situation. Then I would've had the option to decide to pay more, and it wouldn't have been a surprise. Instead, it was as if they were hoping I didn't notice.When I called to speak to the manager afterward, the answer was that because nothing was specified on the invoice that they took down (the same employee who misquoted me, also didn't properly take down my order) they just pulled together the easiest corsage they could, since I was given such a low price to begin with. Had the employee specified what she had told me over the phone on the invoice, they would've honored that. So again, the customer was left at fault because of an untrained employee.

When I told him I did he proceeded to ask me what. I told him the egg sandwich and then he just walked away into the kitchen. Turns out it was the owner. His confrontation was so loud, abrupt and rude that other customers around me asked me if I was okay and encouraged me to say something.

The bun was so light and fluffy.Steak-Shitake Bao- the meat tasted gooood but im not the biggest steak lover because i like my meat really tender but the flavor was definitely there.Fish taco- definitely my favorite! The fish had a crispy batter that wasn't overfried or soggy. Shrimp Taco- definitely did not skimp out on the shrimp!

Not anymore. I went in yesterday. I felt like that by entering the store, I was immediately classified as the type of person who is not to be trusted.

I need it to store the items I plan on purchasing, as I have short T- Rex arms and cannot carry much. Screw you. It is just a quarter, but, come on. REALLY???? The next issue: 1. Eggs. Eggs were 99cents a dozen. They have raised the prices by 1/2 and as of Sunday, when I shopped, they were 1.49. no thanks. I can get that pricing at Dominick's. Target is cheaper too. And guess what? I can get a cup of coffee at both of these places! HA bonus. I do not have to pay for a cart either! 2.

We had previously had a really rotten day of couch shopping at discount stores like Ashley, The Room Place and Value City Furniture, etc. These places did not have fabric options and I found, perhaps surprisingly, not that much cheaper than Cassona .... plus most of the couches were ungoldy uncomfortable and certainly of a lower quality. I wanted a gray couch which is apparently impossible, IMPOSSIBLE I tell you, to get at these aforementioned discount stores. Walking into Cassona I was presented with at least 3 beautiful gray couches plus tons and tons of fabric options. All the couches were very comfortable too, it was quite hard to decide since I was finally faced with beautiful couches in fabrics and colors I loved that had actual lumbar support. We ended up deciding on a 3 person sofa with chaise. The chaise is moveable/removable as it comes with a long cushion and an ottoman underneath that can be moved to the middle or other side of the couch, plus an extra cushion if you want to remove the ottoman entirely. The versatility to change the couch is a great option. The couches all seem to come with 2 accent pillows too and we got to choose through many many more fabrics for those. What I liked most about Cassona, other than the beautiful and not absurdly expensive furniture, was the helpfulness and honesty of the staff. John helped us yesterday and offered lots of helpful tips in choosing a couch and a fabric, explained the different kinds of fabric and how they wear and should be cleaned, explained the warranty and didn't pressure us to purchase. It was nice not feeling uncomfortable about coming back the next day to think it over through the night. We did in fact come back today and the owner helped us place our order and answered more questions. Everything about Cassona is class, from the style of furniture to the care from the staff. Quite a different experience from Ashley Furniture and Value City where I didn't have a singe sales rep offer any information on how the fabric wears or how one should clean it etc. I cannot wait for the couch to arrive!

Overall, the food has some strengths and some flaws and the ambiance is really perplexing...Food: Some items were outstanding. The French Onion Soup was delicate, savory, and rich without a being overwhelmed by burned cheese; exactly how it should be. A+ for that. The asparagus soup was also quite good: yes the asparagus is soft but it's soup people, don't you know how to make soup (i.e. cooking everything together for a very long time so blend the flavors, so of course everything will be soft)? The house salad was fresh but otherwise unspectacular. For the entrees, the first thing they need to work on is presentation, it's just sloppy. I felt like I just got three big spoonfuls of food on my plate. Also, just throwing some random sprigs flat leaf parsley on the plate, why? Garnish should be aesthetically appealing AND serve a culinary purpose. I'm not going to eat raw parsley at a French restaurant. The rice and potatoes are quite good, and the jasmine is a well executed nod to the Asian roots of the owner (who is truly very nice). Though the carrots? They almost ruin the whole plate: just boiled carrot sticks. It saddens me when sides are neglected... The center of the \"plat principaux\" was ok. My beef was cooked well and the sauce was good. However, the salmon my companion had was underwhelming: indeed it's just a regular salmon filet with lemon she could have made at home. The lemon cheesecake dessert was nice in part. The filling was outstanding: it didn't have that \"institutional cheese cake taste\" that so many have, and it was very delicate and subtle. The almond graham cracker crust was not quite adequate: the almonds were not ground quite enough, thus giving the crust an oddly lumpy/granular texture. And again, the presentation was just sloppy, just a slice of cake with a messy dollop of whipped cream that was slightly liquidy and was immediately pushed off to the side. Serivce: Nice but slow. They had one server for the whole place. The owner helped out every now and then (again, who is very nice). One final note, it's obvious that this is a family run place (I think the wife of the owner actually does the cooking) and for that they get kudos. French food is not something you can ordinarily just pull out of your hat and do well.

The soup was excellent. \u00a0(Not as good as my mom's, but then again that is one of her specialties.)We then had our entrees. \u00a0I ordered the Roast Duck in the Apple Brandy Sauce, which came with green beans and rice. \u00a0Everything about this dish was awesome. \u00a0I sopped up every last bit of the sauce after the duck was finished. \u00a0 \u00a0She ordered the Filet Mignon. \u00a0I am not allergic to this so I got to try it. \u00a0it was cooked to perfection. \u00a0She had the baked potato and green beans with that. \u00a0She didn't like the green beans. \u00a0It was not because of the taste (they were cooked perfectly) but she doesn't like how they squeak against the teeth. \u00a0She is an odd duck.Our bottle of wine was finished. \u00a0We were feeling good. \u00a0 \u00a0We were then asked about desserts. \u00a0We were like, why not? \u00a0We both agreed that the two best sounding ones were the chocolate cake and the pecan pie. \u00a0So we decided to order one of each. \u00a0GOOD CALL! \u00a0The pecan pie was perfect and the gooey part was not to sweet, nor chewy. \u00a0The chocolate cake that looked heavy like a poundcake was anything but. \u00a0It was airy and delicious and I got to have the strawberry which came with it. \u00a0She didn't want it, I thought her insane. \u00a0We were having coffee alongside. \u00a0Our waiter Brandon, remember the one that was attentive and easy on the eyes, was only around the proper amount of time. \u00a0He did his job very well. \u00a0The food was brought to us at the proper intervals, and we were quite happy with the whole package.Total for whole evening was 115.00 for the two of us, excluding the tip. \u00a0Since our waiter was attentive and handsome he was compensated nicely.So seeing as my friend and I rarely get to splurge like this, that is why we felt like high school students. \u00a0We were laughing and enjoying the change of pace we usually go for.Then we went home and changed into street clothes to go drinking at the local gay bar. \u00a0Woohoo!", "rating": "5", "date": [2008, 11, 24]}, "10": {"description": "I don't understand how the other ratings for this restaurant are so high?!?!The service was terribly slow.We were told the place is family owned.

Sometimes, they are TOTALLY sucky. Like, a boyfriend breaking up with you out of nowhere, a fellow motorist taking off your rear bumper, a family member dying suddenly...okay, you get the point. But sometimes surprises can be lovely. Edgewater Beach Cafe was just the kind of surprise a girl wants. Ever wonder what that HUGE pink stucco building on the north end of LSD is? It's the historic Edgewater Beach Apartments building, built at the end of the 1920's as a part of the Edgewater Beach Hotel complex. Well, now you know, and so do I. For Valentine's Day, my thoughtful gentleman-friend brought me to the Edgewater Beach Apartments, through the indoor heated garage (validated parking is only $3), past the doorman, through the lobby, down to the arcade, and through the door of the Edgewater Beach Cafe. And just like the EBA, the EBA Cafe brings you back to old Chicago.The atmosphere is lovely. When we walked in, there was a man playing jazz tunes at a piano--now that's old school--for the patrons at their white tablecloths sitting in dark wood chairs. The only thing I didn't appreciate about the atmosphere was that they had these beautiful heavy velvet drapes at the large windows that were street level, and every once in a while, the bus would drive by. For a place so intimate, it seemed weird to NOT close the rest of the world out.Being Valentine's Day, we were offered a 3-course pre-fixe menu. For mains, our options were fliet mignon with garlic butter, duck breast, or Chilean sea bass. We both went with the filet mignon--mmm, my steak was juicy, medium-rare, buttery, savory goodness. Unfortunately, my man ordered the exact same thing, and his was not cooked nearly as rare as it should have been. A small shame.Our server was the only one on that night--yes, it's a small restaurant, but that kind of shocked me--and although he had like 10 other tables, he always seemed to check in at the right times. Way to go, man. Okay, and this is going to sound snobby, but I think EBA Cafe would seem even more upscale if the waiter presentation sounded more sophisticated and less bouncy. Our waiter was really excited to tell us the menu, but the atmosphere of the place is far more reserved than he was.Overall, our evening was beautifully low-key. It helps to have dinner in a place without hype or pretension and be served great food all the while sitting across from the love of your life.

From its historic location - the arcade of the Edgewater Beach \"pink\" building - to the comfortable atmosphere of the dining room, you are free to imagine yourself far away from Sheridan and Bryn Mawr. \u00a0I wrestled with writing a glowing review for fear that too many will discover this gem and intrude on this oasis of vintage hospitality. With the encouragement of recent dining companions and after a second visit, I am prepared to get out the word: want great French food and warm hospitality, try EBC!  Serving dinner only Tuesdays- Saturdays and brunch only on Sundays, the Dao family are gracious hosts and immediately make you feel like you're dining in their home. \u00a0From our first visit in January to our latest on Feb. 15, we were impressed by the consistency and careful attention to the menu's entrees. \u00a0 The 9 entrees and 6 starters on the menu are supplemented by daily specials. \u00a0My friends and I enjoyed a generous and perfectly pan-seared portion of Tournedos of Beef ($29) served with a Burgundy reduction with green peppercorns, in addition to the broiled sole (special) and grilled pork chops ($17). On the second visit, two of us tried the daily special - a succulent rack of lamb from New Zealand ($29) with 4 ribs cooked to perfection. Another enjoyed his Filet Mignon which was topped with a red wine herb butter. \u00a0Their starters \u00a0- for those who need more than the included soup du jour or house salad - range from a terrific Escargot Bourguignon ($9) baked in red wine herb butter to a satisfying Onion Soup Gratinee ($6). \u00a0One of my friends, asked if they would do their Shrimp de Jonghe ($26 as entr\u00e9e) as an appetizer which Mr. Dao graciously accommodated. \u00a0It was divine and made us want to order it as an entr\u00e9e next time. Another visit, we shared or fought over the Shrimp Cachonette ($13) where baked jumbo shrimps were slathered with goat cheese & served on saut\u00e9ed spinach.On a weekday evenings, Mr. Dao may be the sole presence as server, host, bartender, and do whatever needs to be done. \u00a0After 30 years in the business, he seems to be the type where he handles everything with a smile and with a true joy of welcoming new and old friends to his \"caf\u00e9!\" \u00a0He made a number of martinis for us, just to our liking, as well as offering a modest number of whites and reds by the glass. \u00a0His equally charming son, Quan, is usually there on weekends when a piano man enhances the scene with popular tunes. \u00a0Mrs. Dao graduated from the Cordon Bleu and while she stayed in the kitchen, was eager to meet special requests. So if you want to have a truly unique experience with traditional French favorites at a charming, family-run bistro, try Edgewater Beach Caf\u00e9! \u00a0While the signage on Sheridan is not easy to find and street parking is minimal, just look for the garage entrance on Sheridan south of Bryn Mawr. \u00a0Parking is a mere $3 and you don't have to step outside which this winter is a big plus! \u00a0Bon App\u00e9tit!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 2, 19]}, "11": {"description": "This is still hands-down, the best place in Chicago for escargot.They recently remodeled and now, EBC looks classier and even better than before. \u00a0A tip for parking - there's a parking garage/valet underneath the building and it only costs $3. \u00a0And they were recently featured in 190 North!Our group started off with the escargot and shrimp de jonghe which was jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, onions, butter and white wine. \u00a0The sauce was so amazing - we had to request another plate of their warm french bread to sop up the buttery wine sauce. \u00a0The atmosphere was cozy and the live piano playing added to the mood. \u00a0The crowd does tend to be a bit older but service is friendly and really fabulous.All dinner entrees come with either a soup or salad, choice of potatoes or rice and a side of vegetables. \u00a0Their duck is still something out of this world. \u00a0It is slightly pan seared and then, roasted - yum! \u00a0My husband devoured his whitefish which was specially prepared for that evening. \u00a0Our group also tried the NY strip steak, porkchops and Tilapia. \u00a0Overall, everyone enjoyed their meals and couldn't believe how stuffed we were afterwards. \u00a0We had also brought a cake from Buns Bakery (they're actually relatives of the owner of EBC) and they brought that out for us towards the end of our meal.I'm definitely looking forward to another treat out at the Edgewater Beach Cafe - a glass of their Cabernet and their filet mignon next time. \u00a0Or maybe even for their Sunday brunch?", "rating": "5", "date": [2008, 11, 8]}, "8": {"description": "Really like this place.

I like restaurants that imply they have a legion of old ladies in the back working it out and making food that's old school, crazy delicious, comforting, and that will stick to your ribs. I was the teensiest bit scurred, however, because my latest run-ins with donas in the Chicago area had not ended well. At all.I shouldn't have been worried because this dona, likely, chased the other donas out of town. Delicious. This is delicious food without pretense or markup. Come here because you're hungry and appreciate home-cooked food for days. Don't come here to be seen or pontificate on foolishness. This is real. Come here to be real. As others have mentioned, this looks like a refurb'ed garden apartment, complete with steps that go down and low(er) ceilings. There are only, about, 5 tables in the joint and the majority are two tops. This isn't a spot that's good for large groups. It is, however, good for folks who like to eat. And, because the food is so affordable, you can eat a lot.Not knowing what huaraches were prior to coming, I thought it a good idea to order two kinds. Luckily, my dining Girl Friday was up to the challenge. Purpley agua frescas in hand, we settled in for al pastor and chicken huaraches, one with red sauce and the other with green. Do this. Try both sauces but be aware that they also come in bottles if you need more than what comes with the dish. As for huaraches... do you like gigantic pizza shaped orders of masa loaded down with meat, veggies, spice, sauce, and cheese? Do you like knowing there's a real live dona in the house going to town on your food (rather than having one in name only)? Do you like varieties of agua served in Big Gulp-sized jugs?

I had only $5 in my wallet, and that was enough for what I ate - or maybe I stuck my brother with the rest of the bill. Anyway . . .They serve huaraches here, which I had never thought about eating until this day. They look like a Mexican pizza, served on a giant corn tortilla. I am partial to flour tortillas myself, but these were delicious, so I happily consumed. I got the al Pastor - spicy pork, yum - with everything, and green sauce. YUM.

They just ship it to shaking addicts in Tokyo and beyond.I'm not up this way too often, but Metropolis has been on my 5-star cafe list since the first time I set tongue on it, about the time that it opened. The coffee is good, and I especially appreciate the ambience: the big couches and small and group tables; the multiple rooms, both quiet and with music; and the diversity of people here: a many-bean salad of ethnicities and earnings, students and salary-(wo)men, the young and the still-youthful, paper- and pixel-lovers, the engrossed and en-gossiped, those alone and accompanied... Stop me if I'm boring and belaboring you. The counter staff has always been friendly to me, and they've always had a sense of humor in this oh-so-serious world of coffee, where they clearly know beans about beans. When I've seen Jeff, the owner, he's regaled me with stories of his trips to Brazil and the large stacks of sacks of coffee we were standing by, and about the virtues of making espresso with a not-so-dark roasted bean.

Some stuff is not so fresh, but other stuff is amazingly fresh and very reasonably priced. I'm thinking of the asian greens-- fresh baby mustard greens, gai lan, long beans, seasonal melons, many types of eggplants, taiwanese, napa and savoy cabbages, green papayas, etc. for CHEAP.Oh, and their selection of tofu products is usually good (there's lots), packaged noodles (fresh & dry), and frozen meat analogues. The aburage's fresh from Phoenix Bean Products across the street. Then there's miso \"fish,\" kungpao nonchicken, chickenless nuggets, and muttonless mutton chunks. All of the other fake meaties have whey or some other potentially beak-like byproduct in them, so I can't speak to those.Look, I don't care what you say Morningstar's pulled off this week, the Taiwanese have fake meats figured, and Golden Pacific's got it in spades.

I found my favorite \"maruboro\" cookies, little round crunchy / melt-in-your-mouth treats!

They are an intense evening of food and great fun.There are also a variety of cheeses, salamis, and other tasty things for sale. I'm partial to the pimento cheese which is also available from the menu. The breads used are all baked there and many are available to take home as well.

I hardly, if ever, write reviews. I only do this when I feel it is necessary to alert the public that a place is either really crappy or truly worth writing about and promoting. Everyone else on here can worry about writing the multitude of reviews for the 98% of places that are average. 2. For what this place tries to do, it gets 5 stars but as far as public perception is concerned, it gets 4 and I will explain a bit more in my review. Ever wanted to find a trendy, delicious, inexpensive Chicago brunch place with parking right in front without having to wait an hour to two hours before sitting down?So I finally tried out this place today as I have had their sauces before and found them to be insanely amazing (that reminds me, I need to write a review for co-op sauces) and when I found out through Facebook that they also have a kitchen / brunch place I just knew I had to check it out. The place is in Edgewater, right on Devon & Clark. A neighborhood that years ago used to be sketchy at best and not worth visiting. Now its bustling and getting trendy (Thank you Loyola!!) and unique places like this one are popping up. Due to its location, you will have absolutely NO problem finding parking. The girl behind the register was super friendly. The owner prepares the meals (I think this is awesome because it shows he cares about every dish that goes out rather than paying someone else $7 an hour to do it), however...even though when you first walk in you see a sign that says \"ORDER HERE\" you're not sure how things work. People are sitting at tables but you wonder if you should order and sit and wait, or order and stand at the counter until your food is ready (Panera style) or whatever. Its a bit confusing, but you quickly adapt. I ordered my food and went to sit down and was prompted to pay up-front. Ok, that's odd because I am not sure if I'll order more stuff later or what have you, not to mention that I knew going in I wanted more sauces for home, so it kinda threw me off. When you pay it asks if you want to tip - aaaaaaaand I doooooooooooooo... but not before actually trying out the food, service, ambiance and overall experience. So at this point I am forced to say no and leave no tip. I sit down and the friendly girl brings out my Brioche Toast plate and I also ordered a Maple Sausage sandwich. Hey, first time here, I want to try both salty and sweet dishes! Also you can pour your own coffee but i neglected to notice a water cooler nearby so I sat at my table wondering if I water would ever arrive. lol. Eventually I asked and she pointed out the cooler. DOH! Ok, I get it. Its a kitchen type of place, you order, they hand you your dishes and you sit down. No waitstaff and no table service. Thats fine with me, just I didnt know to expect that. The food was INCREDIBLE. No, really. It was. The sandwich was a tad dry but thats perfect because I wanted to try different sauces on it and that made it perfect. \u00a0Nothing required extra salt or pepper or anything. The brioche was just damned good. I really cant describe how excellent everything tasted and for those prices, I mean come on!!! You could eat here 3 weekends in a row for what you'd spend at TOAST or ORANGE (also awesome places). Coffee was also very tasty, bold and delicious. Arggh, I just can't get over how much I enjoyed this place and what a gem it is. I really do hope the community will come out and support and not only help keep this place for years to come but also to make it a huge success, minus the long 2 hour wait times lol. This place is just too good not to share with friends and family. They also sell some baked treats, sauces, granola and bread and just all sorts of goodies. One thing that really threw me off guard was that the bathrooms are impeccably clean. I was shocked. Im not used to seeing places like this have clean bathrooms. Did I mention everything seems to come from small farms, locally grown and fresh? I could be wrong but nothing seemed to be frozen or tasteless and the sauces, the sauces are quite possibly the best thing about the place. I mean, delicious random flavored sauces! Ok, I am starting to ramble on about SBK. Id love to give this place 5 stars only because I am comparing it to a multitude of other brunch places ive been to and while it is not quite there yet, its got an extremely solid 4 stars from me. Things I would recommend for SBK to get that 5th star (simply my opinion and perspective)  - Allow people to pay at the end. I guarantee tips will come in in larger amounts.  - Have lists printed out at the tables with the sauce names, how spicy they are and what they can be used for. (Kinda like a wine list or beer list. Sauces and breads are your thing, enhance your strengths!)  - Maybe just have an empty pitcher for water at each table for people to fill themselves.

We were in the mood for Ethopian food and got a few suggestions to check this place out. Glad we did! It was a miserable -25 with windchill so we really appreciated how close this place was from the Thorndale stop on the Red Line. Literally less than 2 minutes. When we walked in, the place was packed. We were worried we wouldn't be able to get a table because of how busy it was and how crazy we were trying to find anywhere to eat on Valentine's night without reservations. The staff was very accommodating and we sat at a traditional table which I thought was really cool. Our group had a few vegetarians so we mostly ordered vegetarian-friendly (which luckily with Ethiopian food is a lot of the menu) dishes and one beef dish. Our waitress was also incredibly helpful in suggesting items. When the food came, it was all AMAZING and the portions were huge. I thought this place was a great value for the amount of food we got.

In fact they have an online message board and a calendar of events on their website that support this. 5) In the past I have seen groups meet up at the store and sit down and play for 4 or 5 hours - and the store is completely happy with that.

I like fun board games with cartoon-y looking characters. I love mario and was the first person to mock my boyfriend about his Wow love. So when we walked in, I felt very, very out of place. He felt at home and reminisced about his childhood for 2 days afterward. At first, I clung to his side- I feel awkward and judge situations like this. However, I will say this: this had tons of games. The kind of game that you go all over the place looking for but can't find anything interesting sounding at Toys R Us because it's meant for kids. We went in to buy a fun but simple card game called fluxx. The guy in the store gladly showed us where it was at. They had games I was comfortable and familiar with, and games that are really really out there- but overall, it has a great selection, and as soon as I get over being uncomfortable with \"dorky\"/dark graphics as opposed to something you'd see disney do, then I'll love it.

We were going over to the gelato area and the african american young girl 1st did not great us, then almost half of the signs did not match the gelato flavors. I chose not to have any but my girlfriend wanted to try anyways. So she asked to try 2 flavors one being a peanut butter caramel. The young lady was having a difficult time scooping the gelato and then i notice that she was not wearing gloves or did not wash her hands before servicing us. I found that a violation of a heath code being that i am safe serv certified for Illinois. You must wear gloves and wash your hands before servicing customers for ready to eat foods. She completely ignored rules and heath code \u00a0regulations. Customer service was very low. this would be the last time i ever go to that department. I believe she completely ignored her training or was not train very well.The following day 7/10/2015 4:30pm Me and my girlfriend once again went to check out lane 8 ready to check out for our dinner. Once we get into the lane there was a young african american girl that checked us out. we had a few large items like, case of water, water melon, and 1 gallon of juice. Now i can understand a case of water but she refused to pick up the gallon of juice from and the water melon. I even handed it to her and she almost dropped it. she claimed to need to go to the gym. I found that very ridiculous because my girlfriend is much smaller and she can lift as much as i can. I believe in 1 the job description for a retail job is, Are you able to life up to 50lbs? Apparently mariano's just hires anyone. To top that off she total it to $64.07. My girlfriend use her card 1st which she paid $57 and some change then i paid off the remaining. Now the recipe doesn't come out unless it went through so when her portion of the receipt came out i was instructed to swipe my card for the remaining balance. After doing so the rest of the receipt came out and we again poor customer service and all just left. me being annoyed i did not bother to check my receipt.The next morning i see the full amount charged to my card only. I call my girlfriend while shes out of \u00a0state to ask if she was charge to. She says yes cause she saw her balance what was left over on the receipt. I called the store to explain what happened. they looked into it and called me back 2 hours later. first a lady tells me once the receipt they have i was only charged there's no record of her being charge, i respond with well why did \u00a0do we have a copy that says it was charge. she says bring in the receipt. I said i will once my girlfriend gets back but why don't you guys have a copy of that. It doesn't make since that whats on my recipe is completely different from whats on theres. Like you completely over charged me because you have a cashier that does not know what she is doing. I decide to talk with the store manager and he gave me the same response not helping at all. so.

I wish in some ways, this store had a little extra ooompth, like the location on Lawrence. I don't fault this store totally, since I know it has less square feet vs. Lawrence to work with. And I'll still go here b/c of convenience issues, and since it's slightly closer vs. Lawrence. Still those issues that it could improve on are there, and that's the reason I round down instead of rounding up on the stars.Like others said, I sometimes have noticed the occasional employee that's a little rude, unlike at other locations where they seem to try a little more(i.e. Lawrence, Elston). Also, I kinda wish like another Yelper said that they could do something with the greeting card space near the piano player that seems wasted. I wish this store could have an in-store bar added somewhere within the store like Lawrence does, but that's just me.I am happy though that it is an improvement over the Dominick's that was once here, though(both the dingy one pre-2010(?) that had the parking in front of the store, and the replacement Dominick's that was built on this site). The lone thing I miss about the Dominick's days is that I loved the convenience of the US Bank branch within this Dominick's(after the newer one was built), but I won't hold that against Mariano's. I just hope the management of this one could be slightly better and that it doesn't often seem like it's ignored for how well it's ran vs. Lawrence, but I guess we'll see over time if it improves.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 12, 16]}, "55": {"description": "I shopped at this store in it's former life as Dominick's grocery store for 4 years, it had a great selection, I knew all of the employees, and they always went out of their way to accommodate customers requests, especially when you were there at least 4 or 5 times a week. I live down the street, and it was convenient to walk to and leave the truck in the garage.Little changed as it made its transformation to Mariano's, just new employees, a way over-priced juice bar, and they no longer have a Starbucks, whose employees were so nice. They have their Verano brand coffee at a coffee bar, and it pales in comparison to the former.To be perfectly honest, I now drive to the Mariano's on W Lawrence, and that is a whole different experience, and another review. I am writing this review in regard to an incident that took place this evening. I arrived home Sunday evening for my place in Michigan, and found that I had left my wallet, debit card and credit cards there, not a big deal, but an inconvenience, and a 45 minute drive tomorrow to retrieve them, they were in a over-night bag that I forgot to put in the jeep. I was having a few friends stop by and needed some quick nibbles and wine. I called the Edgewater Mariano's and asked if they accepted personal checks, I only write one check month, or I wouldn't \u00a0even keep a check book. The person who answered the call was very professional, and friendly, and stated, it was absolutely not a problem with personal identification, so no problem. I shopped, and was checking out with just a few purchases, $90 worth of snacks and wine. The clerk, although friendly, has never accepted a check, and fumbled for 10 minutes or so as other frustrated patrons were waiting to check out, after several attempts to enter the check, it was accepted but asked for a state code, she was clueless, so i offered that it was probably my Drivers's license code, it was, entered again, and said it was declined. As it happened, Candace the person who had taken my call earlier was called over to assist, and could not get the check to be accepted either. Gratefully she asked me to just come over to the customer service station and she would take care of it. She put the check through and received a c-6 whatever that is, and said that I would need to call a certain number tomorrow to find out why. I remained calm and friendly, and stated that I didn't need these items tomorrow, tomorrow I can go to my bank branch and withdraw the cash I need. She called the store manager Owen over, and explained the problem to him.....same bullshit line, yet he was friendly. I explained to him that between his Mariano's and the Mariano's on Lawrence I spent a significant amount of money, and am in Mariano's 4 -5 times weekly. And I do mean s significant amount of money, ridiculously around $700 - 800 a month. I explained to him although I appreciate their customer service thus far, I find it ridiculous that you would not accept a local check from a regular shopper and simply deposit the next day. Mind you I had $90 worth of \"wine and snacks\" a normal order would have been closer to $150 and that is at least twice a week. I prepare gourmet food for my self and friends, and use the best ingredients, and I and \u00a0they enjoy fine wine and top shelf liquor.I was very kind, and friendly, but I let Owen and Candace know, that under no circumstances would I ever patronize their Mariano's again. And indeed I will never darken its doors or purchase an item there, even if I have to drive across town to do so. I intend to visit the Mariano's on Lawrence tomorrow as, I really like their selection of hard to find items, and incredible wine section. I will talk to the manager there, and see what he has to say, he may salvage my patronage and loyalty, as he is an incredible individual. I also intend to find out whom to contact corporately to file this complaint with. The real clincher is that as this all was going down I was looking at my checking account, with lets just say a significant balance to cover my purchase 100 times over. Inexcusable customer service. I will encourage any person who asks me to never shop at this Mariano's, and I will never spend another dime in that store. More to come on my investigation into a corporate complaint, and as to the other Mariano's take on this stores idiotic handling of this situation. Post script, I had written a check at this store when it was a Dominick's, it was similar circumstances, lost debit card, cancelled...so I wrote a check with no problem.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 8, 24]}, "9": {"description": "Dirty and so slow.

While it's good for the location and the area, the kind of people the store attracts isn't always the best. The cafe is right by the entrance, so most people come in, and just plop in the free cafe seating and never leave. I hate to say it, but it really is bum central.

This has been, for the past couple of months, mo go-to grocery store. Each time, though, I've had an experience that has left me wondering whether or not I should go back.There are many problems here (messy store, disinterested employees, lack of organic proteins, etc.), but the most egregious problem, in my mind, is the quality of the products they sell.Let's start with the produce: the produce is almost ALWAYS bad. I'm talking as bad as Jewel--and that's really saying something.I've tried to get fresh greens, boxed greens, and herbs on multiple occasions, only to find that they were brown, soggy, and spoiled. One time, after finding a whole row of mushy, brown boxed chives, I asked an associate to get me another box from the back. He came back with a whole box of \"fresh' chives, and they were also mushy and brown.The same goes for the (expensive, high-end) boxed greens--like arugula and kale. If you plan on buying any of those things, make sure you turn the box over and check for freshness. The produce, though, isn't the only problem.Last week alone, I had to return a $9 container of \"freshly grated\" Parmesan, a container of organic cottage cheese (with an expiration dated a month from now), and a box of arugula. All were completely sour and rotten. The cottage cheese had liquified and smelled like spoiled milk. The Parmesan tasted like funky blue cheese. (Just smelling it made it obvious that something was badly wrong.)I returned these items without hassle, and I asked to speak to a manager. I spoke to Nunzio, and he was very willing to listen to my complaints. I expressed concern over the quality of the fresh products, specifically, and the overall quality of the store, generally. He listened carefully, noted my concerns, but I haven't seen many changes in the week since. I went today--likely for the last time--and saw several boxes of rotten lettuce.The Edgewater/Andersonville citizen in me--and the cynic--has to wonder why THIS Mariano's location seems to be so lacking, while other locations, in \"better\" neighborhoods, are so wonderful. I'd hope that wasn't intentional, but what other conclusions can I draw?For now, I'll be driving to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, unfortunately.

(The layout of the store on Lawrence is a bit of an IKEA-esque maze.) The quaintness of this Sheridan location just feels friendlier. The sushi to-go is tasty for being pre-made. The pre-made deli sandwiches, on the other hand, which are topped with cheese shaved down to like 1/10 of a millimeter thick, are not so fantastic. I like the pretzel bun and croissant options, but the cheese portions are so half-assed, it's just irritating.Speaking of cheese, this store follows suit with other Mariano's locations in offering a great selection of gourmet cheeses at reasonable prices.
