I had grilled chicken, bell peppers and diced tomatoes. That was one of the best little pizzas I've had in Chicago! Chicago really has the pizza industry down to a science. It arrived hot, great presentation on a mini pizza rack with a spatula. The chicken was seasoned well, the peppers and tomatoes tastes super fresh! The crust was nice and crisp. Look out Giordano's, I might have a new favorite place to eat pizza. Then for desert....we ordered the Cookie Mound with one chocolate chip cookie, one scoop of icecream, and lots and lots of whip cream and chocolate drizzle on top.

I tell her the amount listed for the taxes so she tells the I don\"t know lie, an adds the prices were changed yesterday lie, maybe they just haven't got around to changing the store menu. I picked up the box and left, got in the car and notice she gave me a menu.Open the menu and lo and behold, the menu says the small pizza is 9.75 not 12.00.

Now, being born and raised in Chicago, to say I have a healthy affection for pizza is the understatement of the century! From thin crust to stuffed and deep-dish, I have an appreciation for all things Chicago when it comes to pizza. Home Run Inn, Giordano's, Uno's, Gino's and er, uh -- you get the idea, lol. But today I am reflecting on my experiences with Beggars on 103rd & Halsted Ave on the South Side. The service is nightmarish. All too typical of what you find in the heart of the city, most of the employees appear to be young, largely impersonal individuals. They seem particularly indifferent to anything reminiscent of 'attentive' service, chatting with one another, texting, chewing gum and then perhaps seeing what you could possibly want. Most saddening of all they have managed to make me less fond of the pizza. Beggar's marketing ploy is: We lay it on thick(cheese). I have received a family size with almost 5 entire pieces absent of \u00a0cheese. I have picked up a pizza on occasion to find 1/3 of the cheese is melted to the cardboard box in which it is packaged.Ultimately it's all too much or too little for me. Don't get me wrong, when made right this is an amazing carryout pizza! But ultimately, that doesn't atone for the lack of enthusiasm and attention to product this $27 family size pizza misses at this location..

And my mother's level of pain in her back and joints was very serious and her walking seem to be getting more challenging every month.

From the very beginning Bonny seemed very committed to my mother's progress even if it meant suggesting other non-acupuncture approaches. She took a very holistic approach with acupuncture being one main component. Within a few sessions, my mother's pain drop significantly and her walking improved.

The office/clinic is actually has a serene ambience with new age or classical music playing in the background, sunlight shining (not beaming) down the windows, and matching furniture.I completed several forms inquiring about my health history for the practitioner, Bonny Rhoads, to review. She took time to access my health. After a comprehensive exam and advice, she escorted me back to the main area where I sat on a chair. She then proceeded to insert the needles in several points of my body while closely monitoring my comfort levels. My body was overwhelmed by tingling and numb sensations. She asked me to rest for 45 minutes, but the sensations, particularly on my right hand, were too great. After about 25 minutes, she removed the needles. I felt a bit more energized after the first treatment, but I wasn't sure how effective acupuncture might be. I did sleep better over the next few days. I've been an insomniac by the way.Bonny called me a few days later inviting me to return for another treatment. I was a little wary, but a second try wouldn't hurt (literally). This time around, I was much more comfortable and Bonny was as hospitable as ever. After the insertions (which felt less painful), she wrapped me in fleece blankets and I almost fell asleep.

I've been seeing Bonny since this past September. I've been seeing her nearly every week since then. My story starts out in the field of bodywork and healing. I was a practicing massage therapist and yoga teacher, and after two years, I damaged my ulnar nerves in both arms. Unable to do much of any type of work, with burning pain in my arms and hands and tingling sensations in my palms and fingers, I sought out help from doctors and physical therapists, with very little success. Yoga did not help. Massage helped minimally. It became something that I lived with every day. 8 months went by. I decided it was time I gave acupuncture a try. I found Acupuncture Access through the Wildcard network from Northwestern. From the moment I walked in, I felt relaxed. Bonny creates a calm and open environment. She does a very thorough intake about why you are seeing her, and allows plenty of time for treatments. In addition to my arms, I also suffered from GERD, as well as plantar fasciitis and a heel spur, patella-femoral dysfunction, and PCOS. In the time since I've started seeing her, I no longer have knee pain, or GERD issues. My left arm is completely recovered, and my right arm feels mostly better. My heel pain is very, very minimal, and we are currently working on the PCOS symptoms, of which I am noticing a marked difference monthly. I'm someone who doesn't need pampering with my relaxation. I enjoy the group environment. It's rare that something disrupts the naps that I fall into every time I go. It's some of the most relaxed moments of my week.I'm a firm believer in giving EVERYTHING a chance, to find what works the best for your body, in terms of healing. My body responds better to acupuncture better than anything else I've tried. Bonny is fantastic. Her approach works. She has a keen ear, and a drive to help get to the bottom of ailments.
