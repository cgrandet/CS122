So, I asked if the buffalo chicken was vegan chicken and they said it wasn't. So the heading on the poster was only referring to one of the two burritos. Um, you need to get a new marketing company.So, I finally ordered the vegan green wrap. Unfortunately, they didn't wrap it very well so it immediately fell apart while the girl next to me ate a perfectly wrapped one that stayed together. Oh, well. That said, I enjoyed the wrap. It was filled with rice noodles, greens, tofu, carrots, cilantro, bean sprouts, and cucumbers and came with a peanut sauce.

You heard right, griddle marks. It is painfully obvious the eggs are purchased in precooked patties and then thrown on a griddle to heat them up. It is also clear that they are thrown on the griddle frozen because the griddle marks were black and the rest of the patty was typical neon yellow. To make matters worse, each breakfast sandwich was accompanied by a mixed green salad (greens only) drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Who puts a small tasteless salad as a side for breakfast? To finish off this embarrassment called \"food,\" the orange juice was indeed freshly squeezed, but served room temperature. The ladies behind the counter acted like this was some sort of delicacy; warm orange juice. Never have I heard people so proud to advertise \"fresh squeezed orange juice, served room temperature\".

You could really taste the different ingredients in the sandwich. The baguette was a little hard, but that's okay. It was still good. And the tomatoes were so fresh! I loved it. It came with a side salad drizzled with some sort of balsalmic sauce (you can taste the balsalmic vinegar, I just don't know what makes the sauce so thick!). The espresso was out of this world! Ha. Nicole described it as \"edible espresso.\" I had no idea what this meant, but I thought I'd try it anyway. It sounded good! She said it was topped with mousse and gave me an array of flavors to choose from. I chose hazelnut, and she said it would be \"shaken\" in the espresso. Ok... I still don't know much about coffee (even though I attended the Yelp Gets Cultured event at Asado) and I don't understand her lingo, but I needed something to wake me up because I was very tired! And I think I was most intrigued that it was going to be a cold drink. The drink came to me in a martini glass. Whoa, fancy! Everyone was staring at me as if I was crazy to be ordering a martini in the middle of the day. It's 5 o'clock somewhere though, right? Ha! (The drink is non-alcoholic though). And the taste? It was very good. The frothiness of the mousse added just another sweet touch to the already less-bitter taste of the hazelnut flavored espresso. The drink was sweet, but not too sweet. Perfect. My subtotal came out to be $10.54. Since the Groupon Now is new, the computer messed up a little bit. It only discounted the last item on my receipt.

We're always excited for every Christmas and birthday because that means we get to go shopping together for new charms. That tradition came to a screeching halt this afternoon when I visited the Pandora store at Water Tower in downtown Chicago to buy a snowman charm for my mom.

I was on my lunch break from work, so I politely asked if she knew how long it would be. She replied \"No.\" Ok, awesome. Very helpful. I explained to her that I was on my hour lunch break and if I could possibly add my name to a waitlist now to come and pick up a charm around 5:30. She replied \"No.\" Herein lies my problem. I understand that you're busy. Welcome to the world of retail during the holiday season. But as a loyal customer who is paying a lot of money for overpriced charms that I could buy somewhere else, I expect to be treated with a lot more respect than that. Maybe you could have asked the 3 sales associates standing around the register talking to help out some of the waiting customers? Maybe when asking a customer to sit around with their name on a waiting list, you could do it with a slightly more pleasant tone? My career is in sales and I would never dream of treating a paying customer with such disrespect. All of the bad customer services reviews I've read on the internet are now starting to make sense, and I'm not surprised that about 5 customers walked out behind me after they saw how the woman treated me.

The Drake Bros has a mundane typical brunch of omelet station, meat and cheese, etc. \u00a0Nothing original and at a very expensive price. \u00a0Today we went to the annual \"Charles Dickens Buffet\" at Drake Bros. \u00a0This was originally the best holiday brunch in the city and arguably the world. \u00a0All traditional English 18th Century dishes and a Christmas feeling that couldn't be beat......See below review from 1997: \u00a0articles.chicagotribune.\u2026Not any More.....Now it is a very substandard, mundane brunch that even dedicated 1/3 of the buffet to goofy little kiddie dishes like mac n cheese, french fries, pizza!!!! Yes Pizza at a 75$ per plate freaking holiday buffet..... Grilled cheese, etc...There wasn't even one egg dish, nothing original, just a pasta, a couple meats, one soup, a cutting station unmanned with precut, luke warm meats, the salad dressing could easily be recognized as bottled!!! YES, Freaking bottled dressing!!! The food was a joke. \u00a0The managers, and hostess barely spoke clear English, I think this place has been contracted out to some foreign owned chop shop restaurant operation.....What a damn shame. \u00a0If you read the above tribune review from 1997, you will see how wonderful this Event once was, and how incredibly foolish the hotel management is to allow it to be destroyed like this. \u00a0You are basically paying for the Michigan Avenue views. \u00a0They didn't even do the parade, just some Santa wandering around....But the carolers were very good. \u00a0I have to say, the rest of the Drake is awesome still, from the decorations, the Palm Court, the Coq'dor lounge, etc....

I don't cook, and he doesn't want to anymore.We happily leave it to the pros!So we had Christmas Dinner at Drake Bros. and couldn't have asked for a better experience. It was a bit of a pricey prix fixe 4-course, but we couldn't say it wasn't totally worth it. Started with a generous and delicate pan seared scallop, moved onto lobster bisque and our entree was the Beef Wellington -- cooked to an absolutely perfect medium. Seemed to liquefy in my mouth. Even the dessert buffet was good -- my dad loves mince meat pie, which is a decidedly 20th century delicacy these days. Well, the Drake dessert menu had mini mince meat pies! Leave it to the Drake to get it right!We had a lovely table overlooking Lake Michigan on an unseasonably mild, sunny Christmas Day. It was a wonderful experience. My \"complaints\" are relatively small -- the butter should be room temperature; the booth seat is a little low and the table a little high for a petite gal like me. And I don't like the fact that there's no place to sit in the valet area. My dad's 81--if he's gotta wait 10 minutes or more for the car, he needs to sit.Otherwise, The Drake does an amazing job and has a packed house for Christmas. We had a lovely visit from Santa, who even sat down at our table because he was tired (he'd been working all night, you know...) and the old-fashioned carolers were a nice touch as well. My dad was talking about that Beef Wellington and those mini mince meat pies three days after dinner -- always a good sign that he enjoyed himself.

I said why not measure my feet. I start following her and she turns to me and says that this other guy will do it. It was so weird! Anyway, he comes over and says, \"Do WE need our feet measured?\" I was tempted to say that I didn't know about him, but since it was offered...But I didn't. Instead, I said, \"Well, I think I'm this size but the other salesperson just offered.\" And he said, \"I'll just get you the shoes in both sizes you mentioned.\" I mean, why offer the service if seemingly no one wants to do it?? Anyway, he brings out about 10 boxes and I said, \"That's a lot of boxes.\" I'd only asked to see one pair of shoes. Well, he \"took the liberty\" of bringing out something else that was totally unrelated to what I'd asked for, claiming that that particular pair was that store's \"top seller.\" Whatever. I try my selection on and he disappears. Well, they look horrible and I wanted to try on another color of the same style. I had to wait for him- or anyone- to come and ask me if I'd like to see something else. And then he's finally back, trying to push other shoes on me again. I asked about the other color and he said they were very popular and sold out in my size. He then suggested that he could bring out a larger size so that I could see what it looked like and then I could buy them from him and get free shipping. Well, they have free shipping all the time on the Clarks website, so why would I do that? The whole thing was totally bizarre, unhelpful and a waste of my time. The other thing is that they were having a buy one, get 25% off a second pair. So he was trying to sell me another pair when I hadn't even settled on the first pair! Long story short, he was a lousy sales guy and the other two people there were also weirdos. That said, I'm glad I was able to see these and try them on in person before I made the mistake of ordering $100+ online that wouldn't fit correctly and are, well, ugly.

I got a Lifebook Loot certificate for a facial for $25. I was excited because I have had oily Lebanese skin my whole life. I was planning a big trip home to the east coast for Thanksgiving which included stops in Philly, AC, NYC, and Boston. I was going to 2 Watch the Throne shows, a wedding that specific night of the facial, and it was my birthday so I decided to indulge myself. When I walked in Claudia and her sister were extremely friendly. They led me to the room and I began to relax under the steamer. I don't remember her sister's name, but she was extremely kind. Claudia, on the other hand, was a monster. She told me my face looked terrible (um, yeah, I think I know. I wouldn't be here if I had great skin! And it was that time of month), and that I needed A LOT OF WORK. This made me feel really bad, like it was borderline upsetting. This is where she began to go to town on my face. She prick, pried, and needled all the imperfections out. I walked out of the salon with a puffy red face. I went home, took some aspirin, and went to the wedding without any make up (like she said). The next few days I didn't see any drastic changes in my skin that I had hoped. I think it finally cleared up like 2 weeks later once I got home from my trip. My face was scabbed and scarred and I think it's safe to say I will never return.It would be one thing if my facial cleared my face a bit (I don't expect a miracle), but the attitude and rudeness that came along with it was not helpful. Also, towards the end of the facial, I heard people in the lobby so the place is not private at all.

\u00a0That's what you should take my advice with.That out of the way, this store apparently thinks that 21-year-olds (that you should \"Forever\" aspire to be like) are loud, obnoxious, whorish, antisocial, devious and horrifically disorganized. \u00a0Either that or it doesn't understand what people think when they see a store labeled \"Forever 21\".I always thought that the music system in a store/business was meant to entice the patrons and lull them into a sense of comfort, like casinos do. \u00a0This place throws that notion out the window, then records the sound of all that window-glass shattering, and loops it at about 100 decibels until you're clawing at your ears to rip them off and end your suffering. \u00a0I'm not at all a \"hep cat\" (or however the youths are saying that nowadays), but I do have a wide range of music knowledge at my disposal. \u00a0And that sounds like a garbage disposal.If there's one thought that undoubtedly runs through the minds of these clerks 21 (and forever) times a day, it must be \"This place would be great - if it weren't for the customers!\" \u00a0Let me tell you something, Forever 21 executives. \u00a0The idea of being \"forever 21\" is supposed to appeal to PEOPLE OLDER THAN 21 because they wish they could be forever at that perfect age without growing old, like they are currently doing. \u00a0So how in the name of all that is good and right in this world did you pick a target demographic who is 14-18 years old? \u00a0These pubescent sticks of hormones wouldn't know 21 without the aid of a time machine - so how can you allow them to strive to be Forever 21?This store would be 30 times better if there were a bouncer at the door blocking women who couldn't present a valid I.D. - and it would be 300 times greater if it served alcohol. \u00a0Something for the menfolk - other than the clothes themselves...Whorish (adj.): a word to describe the clothing at Forever 21. \u00a0Done.We wandered the store for about 25 minutes in total and I was asked ONE TIME, \"are you finding everything you need?\" \u00a0I was not, because what I needed was for the store to sell more than 2 items in the size XL, neither of which I had located. \u00a0Unfortunately, before I could verbally get any of that out, the clerk had been distracted by something shiny and walked away. \u00a0Perhaps her hearing had been permanently damaged by the \"music\" and thought she heard me say \"yes\", so she was free to leave.As for the deviousness and disorganization, it's rampant. \u00a0Every \"sale\" sign in the place has those words \"and up\" attached to them, so by the time I've found something almost passable to purchase (after digging through stacks of items not sorted by size or anything useful or located near any similar items), I find out it's twice the price of the other stuff. \u00a0I'm fully aware that more material is needed to create an XL shirt than an XS - but people who can fit in an XS are too young to be shopping at this store. \u00a0Or need to eat something, please!(UPDATE: This store no longer sells XL at all. \u00a0They decided that XL is for people too fat to shop in their awesome store and is now part of their \"Faith 21\" line for plus-sized people. \u00a0Even though this new line only sells sizes in \"XL, 1X and 2X\". \u00a0They're dumb for considering XL and 1X to be different sizes and they're mean for making my S.O.'s 14-yr-old sister feel fat and unwanted in their establishment.)I'm frankly waiting for the revolution to begin. \u00a0The overweight are outnumbering the underweight, and all of these stores selling to the \"pretty people\" and offer nothing above a size L need to be driven out of business. \u00a0Yes, there will always be a size S in a department store for you - that doesn't mean we should have a nationwide chain of stores that ONLY sell size S. \u00a0And yes - I plan on posting this in every review I write of businesses who think that they don't have the obligation to offer clothing in sizes that are becoming more of the norm.Of course, those other stores might have a title that doesn't show complete disregard for itself like \"Forever 21\" does. \u00a0Then again, if a store were built around my 21st year, it would sell sweatpants and Nacho Cheese Doritos. \u00a0So grab that grain of salt, because this is the end of my rant:I guess I'd have to recommend this store to whorish teens who long to be 21 - and suggest that anyone who has survived that year and knows of the horrors of vomit-stained carpets from binge drinking that should not be revisited forever avoid this place like the plague.", "rating": "1", "date": [2009, 7, 25]}, "12": {"description": "There is so so much to hate about this store.

I know it was Black Friday and it was hectic but that's no excuse. I asked 6 people to assist me and my daughter with a coat purchase. \u00a0We both had found coats that we had been eyeing for a while and where quite excited. Out of those 6 people, only one young man stopped and looked me in the eye and had a conversation with me. He explained that he did not work in that section or on that floor and could only answer one of my questions, which he did graciously. I appreciated that. The thing is, if you work with the public, you need to at least pretend like you give a $%^&: pretend like you want to be helpful which other than him, no one did. Give me something-damn! One lady held up her pop and cheetos and pointed to her face and said I'm exhausted. Seriously?! Another lady said she was helping other people and would try, try to get back to us. She said this rather snidely. I swear I only saw her walking around like she was security, nothing else. Okay. Sorry to bother you. Everyone else said they didn't work that particular area. Okay.

The people cleaning the tables cleaned your \"reserved\" table before you are done. At the \"stir fry\" station the workers never called out when your order was ready, and if they did, you wouldn't hear them anyway because the music was too loud. A PA system would be useful for this. I saw other patrons annoyed at the same things that bother me. A lady at a table near me waited 20 minutes for her food, she came up to the counter and asked for her order and the man told her, \"oh it's over there, it was ready like a while ago\".I had a chicken stir-fry and it was over-sauced, salty, and too sweet. I would compare it to \"Pei Wei\" style, but the veggies seemed less fresh. The drink selection was decent, with a noteworthy assortment of iced teas. If I were to come again I would try \"GRILL\", which is a station where you can get grilled fish and other meats.The value is terrible.

I know what kinda bras I like, so I start looking for one that doesn't have 2 inches of padding. I find a cute polka dot one.

I'd rather just try that polka dot one on. So 40 minutes of dealing with some scatter-brained ladies upstairs, trying on a bunch of bras I didn't like to begin with, I come back downstairs. Yup, as suspected, I just want the fucking Polka Dot Bra, PLEASE. Guess what? We don't have it in your size.....ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? WHY DID YOU JUST WASTE NEARLY AN HOUR OF MY TIME.

Why you gotta make things complicated without ever checking if you have what I want in stock?Then I decided that it was one bad experience and many months later came back to use my birthday coupon they sent me in the mail. The coupon said something like free gift up to $15. So I came in an ask the nice lady in the front if I can use it towards a bra. She says yes, calls someone else over who also says yes. Then I spend some time picking out a new pretty bra, go to the front to use my coupon, where I encounter the Bitchzilla of them all. She, of course, tells me I can't use the coupon towards anything over $15. Knowing that VS is pretty lax on all the offers they send out, I tell her that two of the associates told me I could, which is why I spent all this time picking something out, and if I can maybe talk to a manager or something.

Is there a secret conspiracy to get me to become a mall-shopper again? I mean, with this kind of customer service (first at the Limited, now VS) I may have to admit defeat.I decided, being 30, that it was time for me to get a bra and some underwear that actually matched. I tried the lingerie section in Macy's and wasn't even spoken to by the three saleswomen on the floor. On to Victoria's Secret.The salespeople jumped on me immediately. At first, I thought this was going to turn into one of those awkward situations where I had to choose which one of them to give the sale to. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the team approach.Girl A asked me what I was looking for. I told her that I needed a big-girl bra. She then asked what level of padding I like, etc. After she got an idea of what I wanted (i.e. something to mold my perfectly-sized girls into perky perfectly-sized girls), she introduced me to Girl B, who would be assisting me with my fitting. I swear, this woman brought me everything. And they were all perfect. That fitting made me love my boobs again. Girl B took me back to Girl A and told her what bra I liked and what size I was. Girl A then showed my my color options. Easy as pie.I think what I really liked the most, besides my beautiful new bra, was the way the team worked together. I found it to be a low-pressure situation, I felt comfortable, and didn't feel rushed. Brava, ladies.

The dining room is a mix of reclaimed wood, brick, leather, and concrete.

The Pisco was good too. Very spirit-forward). We ordered quite a few menu items, used a great groupon and the meal was WELL worth the price. TRY THE STIFFED MUSHROOMS AND THE BACON ONION TART.

We sat outside and started with a cheese fondue. The server advised us that the fire could go out with the wind but we decided to risk it. Glad we did because it wasn't a problem at all. The cheese was delicious. They didn't bring enough bread and veggies but refilled after we finished with the first basket. We each ordered a cocktail which was small and overpriced. Basically the usual scene in downtown Chicago these days. It was vey good though. We decided to get the steak skewer, bacon wrapped chicken skewer, and Mac and cheese. First came the Mac and cheese and beef. They came a few minutes apart and the Mac and cheese almost went to the wrong table. Well, the chicken actually did go to the wrong table. The server figured out what happened and apologized and hurried out the next chicken. By the time we got it we were already full. We took a bite to try and the chicken inside was raw. Guess they hurried a little too much. Too bad because it tasted great. It took forever for a server to come by again and when he finally did we sent it back, too full to order another. Although all these snafus sound problematic, they handled it perfectly. The head chef came by with a vaportini and asked what else we needed. We ended up ordering a chocolate fondue. It was my birthday after all. They ended up comping the dessert and the drink which they didn't have to do but left a great impression in my mind. It's not like our meal was cheap either way.

We then ordered a glass of wine and didn't receive it for 20+ minutes and it was totally empty in there, not busy at all. My friend had joined us eventually and he was also having the same problem. He ordered a glass of wine and he saw it sitting at the bar for about 15-20 minutes and almost just grabbed it, and then our server asked the bartender \"what is this glass of wine for?!\" And then I guess he realized it was my friends that he ordered about 20 minutes ago. The bartender was getting so pissed off at him, cursing and crying and it was just so weird because we were so close to the bar and could see everything. I guess she was realizing how incompetent he was and kept freaking out about it. It took about 45 minutes to even receive our food, which was actually pretty tasty (we got the scallops, Brussels sprouts, shrimp, roasted veggies and my friend ordered the meatballs). The veggies and Brussels sprouts seemed drowned in sweet sauce, which it didn't need. The meatballs didn't arrive with our food and my friend asked about it and he said it was coming right out. 30 minutes later, still no meatballs!

Think speakeasy meets downtown lounge. Booth seating near the bar was nice. There's also a gorgeous table seating area with windows to the street but a ton of privacy. The dining room is a mix of reclaimed wood, brick, leather, and concrete. Holiday decor is up, too, and the manager (great guy) mentioned while chatting w us that they'll be adding some more winter drinks to the cocktail menu (although we tried two cocktails and they were both FANTASTIC creative takes on classic cocktails-highly recommend the sangria-pineapple foam combo but can't remember the name. The Pisco was good too. Very spirit-forward). We ordered quite a few menu items, used a great groupon and the meal was WELL worth the price. TRY THE STIFFED MUSHROOMS AND THE BACON ONION TART. Just do. And the Surf and Turf Skewer was to die for. In the future I will order two of them and try the bacon wrapped dates. We also tried the Rosemary pork, which was delicious, but, as pork tends to be in restaurants, was a tiny bit dry after hanging for ten/fifteen minutes and we ended up using a sauce intended for the steak... Still a great choice. By the way, dive into the kale chips they offer at start of meal; they're perfectly done and much better than you'd expect of not a kale fan. Lastly, our server was great. He offered his own opinion but also listened to what our interests were, and didn't give us that \"oh you're using a groupon\" attitude, which was refreshing.

When we tried it, the meat was cold and the part we ate was medium well done. I called the waiter over and asked if this was actually MR and he apologized and said I'll go in and check for you and get a better one. The whole night he was passive aggressive about it saying \"actually it was medium rare, you just didn't get to the rare part later on\" to dismiss our comment. Then a separate waiter came to bring he steak and was very adamant about sharing how the rare parts are closer to the middle and how it should be perfect now. While it should have had a helpful tone, it came as more of an insult. The actual meat wasn't bad, just needed the sauces to really get any flavor out. The jumbo shrimp was huge but was bland and had no flavor. They need to add seasoning or something to it or it tastes just like the filler fake crab meat they use in sushi sometimes.The bacon wrapped chicken was so cooked I couldn't taste the bacon and the chicken was not tender at all.

It's so smooth and creamy but still maintains the very strong flavor of cauliflower. \u00a0Pistachio crusted pork - The pork is cooked really well and the pistachio crust on the outside adds a crunchy dimension. Be careful when you pull down the pork from the skewer because the crust doesn't stick on the meat very well. It separates really easily which I was sad to see :( Beef tenderloin tips - Also loved this one - super savory, beef is tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the yogurt horseradish sauce on the side but the beef itself is excellent. Bacon wrapped dates - Good, but very make-able in your own kitchen.

That is what I mean by depth, they will be able to provide any customer with a product, but you may have to go else where for more accessories, further upgrades, or whatever (depending on product).The staff that I have spoken with are all very helpful and nice and liked to make conversation.

Trekked up the stairs which were a lot of stairs for a girl in work heels. Once there, another worker was immediately there, so looking at the expansive second floor, I asked her where I could find the section I needed. She pointed in a general direction (straight) and said \"to the right\". Followed her directions, no flash drives in sight. Found another employee who this time led me to the section that was right in back of where I had asked the girl earlier. Before I got the chance to thank the employee that led me to the right section, he was gone. I really felt like this unreal, that maybe I was being punk'd.

If its in the computer, then how come its not in the lockup cage? Seems suspicious. Finally called on the phone over here and was told they had one. I asked if they could physically find it and secure it for me. The assured me on the phone that they had it in there hands. So I drove down and there it was with a piece of paper with my name on it.

Best Buy was happy because I stopped calling them asking for a white PC. \u00a0This location is a great addition to Michigan Ave. Everyone needs things for there gadgets plus we need lots of gadgets. Not many places on this block can hook you up with an HMDI cable. Trust me when your doing a presentation and the Westin wants to charge you $100 to rent a cable. It's so much cheaper to walk over here to Best Buy. I'd rather buy it and have it for future presentations, then rent it for the day.

We all need an 80 inch TV...right!!!Thanks Best Buy for having a location on Michigan Ave and making it fun for guys to shop again. Plus how cool is it to have a store located in the 4th tallest building in Chicago, considering you're only on floors 1 & 2 of that building. There's always room to move up!

So the lady on the phone told us that there should not be a problem going back and returning the item.

So I believe that the store onTtouhy really have inept people working in there from the short overly Plumpy Short Girl who was in the customer service department to the Chip on the shoulder Bald store manager who should keep his snide remarks to himself. Buyer beware they used and excuse that since there was a return on the account in a 90 day period that is why it was FLAGGED so I looked at the date of the return it was dated December 30th 2012 the new policy that was put into place started Janurary 1st of 2013 so this should not pertain to the new policy also SINCE THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THE MATH from December 30th to April 24th it has been more than 90 days so they are either VERY STUPID OR JUST PLAIN IGNORANT as to how does customer service really works.

In fact, I have visited this Best Buy a few times prior to this and each time I seem to attract the coolest employees. I guess I just \"got it like that.\" At any rate, one of the best things about this particular Best Buy is clearly the location. Located on the ground floor of the John Hancock building, it is prime and subject to the \"mall crowd.\" In other words you run a risk of trying to navigate your way through a sea of families that are fully prepared to NOT buy anything - however just there to spend time. I also LOVE the view from the second floor of this building. Mid shopping, I had to take a moment to just stare out the window and look up and around. Sometimes the city still just has this effect on you. The staff at this Best Buy are cool as I stated earlier. One thing I enjoy is that they the staff here...they let you digest the products before they come meandering over to you with whatever sales pitch they've been brainstorming for the past 5-10 minutes they've been watching you browse. In particular, I was approached by the associate Jordan. He was HILARIOUS. A very sarcastic sense of humor that would come across (to some) as pompous, but I resonate well with humors such as his being a performer myself. Provided that I used to be a retail manager, I was very impressed with how easily he made a connection with me and my friend. He shared the appropriate amount and type of personal information without seeming creepy or intrusive - when asking questions about my personal life. We had a great time. Jordan was VERY knowledgeable about product. I am on the market for a new TV and he was able to offer some very nice suggestions based on my budget and needs. He went through all of the pros and cons of the different TVs I was looking for, and made sure that I was prepared for whatever problems - if any - I would have with lesser quality models. The only thing I would have loved for Jordan to do is not hold out on the duration of sales. I am not sure if he was just trying to make a sale right then and there or if he legitimately did not know when the sale was ending for the TVs, but i checked online when I got home, and it was plain and simple that this was a part of their weekly deal. Surely management communicated this with the staff during their morning meetings. Perhaps not. At any rate, I still had a grand time with Jordan.I decided which TV I wanted, and will return after I have had some time to digest the small dent in will leave in my bank account. #AINTNOTIMEFORIMPULSEBUYSBIH*sidenote: These bathrooms are very well maintained.

This is just another page in this ad infinitum saga of returning an item at Best Buy. Sit down, grab a wheelchair because the PS30 will be out by the time Best Buy sorts me out. As one might have expected after several hours of dealing with a company that one must only assume bases their customer service training on the Vancome Lady.

After he refused to agree to the arbitrator's solution, I called the store and was able to get ahold of the elusive Scott in his office. I explained my situation to him in a much more personal way, assuming that a mere personal chat was much more effective than heavy handed lawsuits, BBB complaints, credit card disputes, and the rest of my arsenal might be. Instead, \u00a0Predictably, Scott was just as unwilling and unmoved by my plight as Damian had been the night before. Scott couldn't possibly do a favour as huge as accepting a return past the 15 day mark. His response actually sounded as if I was asking him to give me the keys to the store's safe.

It turns out to be almost identical to the Cinnamon Apple Pancake for the Original Pancake House. Except it is about 2/3 the size and 2/3 the cost. That really isn't a criticism. I LOVE the Cinnamon Apple Pancake at Original Pancake House, and I absolutely loved this dish as well - but it really wasn't what I expected for French Toast. It has the advantage over the Pancake House \u00a0version in that it is a more manageable size (the Original Pancake House version is really a meal for 2 very hungry people - this can be eaten by one with only moderate amount of guilt for overeating).

They do have a solid collection of post-war minimalist, surrealist, conceptual works - and the blockbuster shows they put on are generally worth the trip, regardless of what you think of the artist/s featured....thought part of me still wishes that I could un-see the Koons retrospective of 2008 as I wasn't curious what his penis looked like before the show, and am certainly no less intrigued now....but it's contemporary art.

In Bogata, the artist's hometown, you do not see the river of mourning because people long lost the ability to cry. From Salcedo's perspective, the fear of death leads to the fear of life, ultimately leading to gang violence. In memory of lost lives, she created Plegaria Muda '08-10 - 2 hand-crafted tables, which approximate the size and shape of coffins. In order to place the life of the dead who were massacred in banana plantations in the memory of the living, the artist created Untitled Works '89-90, white cotton shirts impaled by steel rebar. Here, the boundaries which divide Life from Death are vague, as the standard dress of workers is no different from the funeral dress for the dead.For the artist, Colombians only deepen the wound of the society when they neglect to mourn. Thus, Salcedo built Disremembered '14, raw silk shirt that incorporates 12,000 needles. By failing to cry, people choose to deny their humanity. No one saves us but ourselves.

It was a bit more crowded inside.... You have to line up to get in and at first people would stand around looking at his most iconic stuff giving the illusion that there is a line but I soon realized there was no line...the reality is that some stuff enjoyed less traffic than others so it was better sometimes to go and look at that stuff first and maybe come back later for the stuff that people initially crowded around.

The building is welcoming, with wide steps leading to the 2d story entrance. \u00a0There are picture windows with great views, and places to sit, read catalogs, and watch videos. Exhibits are laid out over just three floors. The whole is manageable in 1-2 hours.What do you see? Usually 3-5 different shows, arranged 2 on the second floor, 1 in a small gallery on the third, and 1 or 2 on the fourth floor. Each will highlight either an individual artist's work, a theme or trend in contemporary art, or some curator's idea of an interesting way to showcase a group of works. Exhibits showcase the full gamut of contemporary art, and all the exhibits are temporary. The permanent collection is not on display, except when some pieces are brought out in connection with a current show. Very often, you won't recognize the artists unless you normally keep informed about contemporary art--that's a good thing obviously, because you're being exposed to new things here all the time.In my experience, the exhibits range from fantastic, like Isa Genzken, to the terrible, like \"The Way of the Shovel\" (don't ask). No need to mention \"Bowie Is\" -- it was over-the-top terrific. So the basic point is that each time you visit, your experience will vary. \u00a0You see the good AND the bad. \u00a0But you have to visit over and over, like every couple of months, to get what is going on here. \u00a0A single visit will be the luck of the draw.

Interesting but the amount of bread far exceeded the actual beef. It came with fries that were pretty plain and boring.

On the other hand, the service was so atrocious (yes, I busted out a teacher word!) that it makes me wonder if I'll come back. When we arrived, I was glad to see that it wasn't super busy, especially considering that we came on a Monday afternoon about 12:45. I told the waitress that we were a party of four adults and two toddlers. They seated us pretty much right away, but when we sat, they arranged the table for two adults and four kids :/ Meh....easy enough fix. The waitress, however, didn't come and greet us or acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes. Now for those of you who follow my reviews, this is huge for me!:( She took our order, which was pretty simple enough, and than we didn't see her again! So let me start with the good....the food:Warm Spinach and Artichoke Dip: This was actually really good! Now I know many people will be wary since it IS artichoke dip, but either we were just starving by the time food actually appeared on our table, or it really was that good! They do come with, what seems like, homemade corn tortilla chips. The basket they give is definitely not enough for the portion of dip that they give, so ask for an extra basket!Grilled Chicken BLT: This looked really good on the menu, so cousin and I shared. With an extra side, this is definitely a shareable portion! The chicken was really good, and relatively moist. The bacon was nice and crispy, and again a good portion in comparison to the sandwich. The star of the sandwich was the basil aioli, which definitely gave the chicken a different and herby flavor.Bacon Mac 'n Cheese: This side was DELISH! The side, although pricy at $9, was a huge portion! Let's just say that cousin, and I AND my daughter were able to eat the side! The pair was definitely a great portion for lunch, and than some! The sauce was good, with a good smoked gouda flavor, and a generous helping of bacon throughout. The rest of the party had other meals including the mac and cheese and grilled cheese for kids (which both looked good!) as well as the Holy Cow! burger (huge and looked delish!) and the BBQ chicken pizza. Now for the not so good part....the service :( Throughout our 1 1/2 hr lunch (with two toddlers!!) we had to ask for our server multiple times, watched two tables be sat after we sat, eat, and leave before we got food, as well as having to ask for our appetizer again because she had forgotten it! We even had to ask for things like drinks for the kids or more water. The manager was super nice and accommodating, which definitely helped, and he did make sure that the appetizer came out within 10 minutes. I did end up talking to the manager after our meal to tell him that the service was really bad. He again apologized, said that they would take care of it right away, and seemed genuinely concerned with the poor service. This is was really made me give them a 3-star rather than a 2-star.

The fries were really good, but you really don't get very many for the price. I would equate it to the amount I would expect to come with a sandwich at Chili's or something.

Grinning ear-to-ear, we carried it triumphantly to the cashier, presented our gift certificate and the cashier says: \"You can't use this certificate in a Lego store.\"With raised eyebrow and attitude, I ask: \"What should we do, take it down the hall to Nordstroms?\"Now, for the technical bizbaz that makes me spaz:Cashier: \"That type of 'e-gift certificate' can only be used to order Lego products online; you can't use that in any Lego store. Plus, that item you want to buy has been discontinued, so it's no longer in our online catalog, which means if you want to buy that item you can't use that certificate at all, anyway.\"Glad I'd taken my blood pressure meds lately, I knew better to argue with him, and set off to find a manager.Long story short, the intelligent and sympathetic manager called his district manager, and in a voicemail message explained the obvious: with that e-gift certificate, Lego had essentially dragged us into the store all eager and excited only to disappoint. It was hardly apparent \u00a0to Grandma or anyone else that what Grandma intended to buy her grandchild was the experience and fun of the hunt in the Legoland store, but that's not what she bought; and, for gosh sakes, what's the point of selling these certificates online if you need a Ouija Board to parse the fine print to realize they don't really allow the recipient whatever Lego products that Lego sells, new, discontinued or otherwise?I left the Lego manager my business card, and asked him to call me if he had any luck, because we really had our hearts set on that normally very expensive, huge, bright red, real boyish, testosterony, Star Wars Lego space ship thing that was discontinued and marked down about 35%. About an hour ago, I received a phone call from the Lego Lady who left me a really sweet voicemail with instructions about how to contact her so we can obtain whatever we want with the money Grandma gifted with such good intentions.The best part was imparting that news to the thrilled, soon-to-be-owner of that normally very expensive, huge, bright red, real boyish, testosterony Star Wars Lego space ship thing that was discontinued and marked down about 35%.

Most of the store is sadly devoted to selling various branded sets with specialty pieces you can't use for anything other than building the thing on the box. They do have a small section in the back of the store where they sell generic sets with 250-1000 pieces, but the options are slim. Along the back wall, they've got bins of pieces that you mix and match. You an fill a large container for $15.99 or a small container for $8.99. The signs say that the large containers can hold 325-375 pieces, and the small containers can hold 125-175 pieces, but obviously this depends on which actual pieces you want to get. I've never actually taken the time to count how many pieces I ended up getting, but I will say that a good strategy is to put big pieces in first and then sprinkle smaller pieces in the cracks. If you're building some project and really need a specific piece or a specific color, I would recommend getting all the pieces you might use together, because they do switch them out regularly. Also the containers themselves are really nice for storing dry goods like beans or rice afterwards.Despite its lack of actual products I want to buy, the Lego Store is a fun place to come and just play with Legos.

I still have a bucket of legos at home and I enjoy watching the little one spend hours putting stuff together. I love seeing the imagination and creativity at work. That is why I loved Legos as a kid. I love the giant Lego sculptors in the store. I also learned that they are built off site and glued together. I always had a fear of accidentally knocking one over and it shattering into 10,000 pieces. Then the staff makes me rebuild it and I'm there for months. So I can cross that worry off my list. You don't have to be a tourist to visit the Lego store even though you will find a ton of tourists shopping here. \u00a0Legos are international.

However, this store totally lacked the ambiance of the Aerie store in Woodlfield Mall (in Schaumburg), which has its very own store separate from American Eagle, and has a much more girly, \"you're floating among the clouds in cute underwear\" type of a feel to it. In Schaumburg, the sales associates are also very helpful about bra/underwear fittings and will wrap your purchases in a pretty bag with a colorful ribbon that you get to pick out. (I'm a HUGE sucker for packaging.)At this store, however, you're going to have to put up with obnoxious Justin Bieber music and 16-year-old sales associates that don't come anywhere near the Aerie section.

Asked the server if there's meat in it and he had to refer to the chalkboard menu (um... I can read too, you know). $8 for a serving of what turned out to be soggy lasagna w/ 2 slabs of prosciutto, I'm disappointed.

My favorite was the burrata. Soooo delicious and enjoyed the next day as well.

We asked for some wine recommendations and we were guided to a very nice bottle, so the server knew what she was doing. Our food arrived rather quickly and we were pleased with it.

It's a complete experience that's a must-do for foodies and wine enthusiasts.To start of, Disotto is just gorgeously decorated: the interior is rustic and classy but comfortable enough that you can kick back and relax with friends. The servers are lovely and very knowledgeable about wines and are very accommodating about any requests you have. Five stars just for service alone! I believe my servers name was Elliot, he was helpful, respectful and very patient and also offered a lot of good suggestions. We tasted a few wines, all good recommendations before we settled on our carafes.What also stood out to me was the quality of the food- Disotto Enoteca serves small bites, so the food is generally the size of an appetizer. We ordered the Caprese - which has a large hunk of mozzarella cheese with fresh tomatoes, I am not a fan of cheese but this dish was really to die for. The cheese was soft, aromatic and just very delicious! It also paired well with the white wine. Very delicious dish and clearly too notch ingredients. The tomatoes were sweet and aromatic: unbelievably good.We also ordered the eggplant meatballs in marinara sauce. To me this was a stand out dish, the crispy eggplants, the delicious tomato sauce. I just wanted to lick the plate when I was done. Absolutely phenomenal dish. I will be dreaming of it from Cali.Lastly we ordered the truffle egg toast. Despite the popularity of this dish I was really underwhelmed. It's pretty much your run of the mill toad in a hole. Would really not recommend except for the fun factor.All in all I had an amazing experience at Disotto Enoteca and cannot wait to go again to sample more delicious wines and food!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 7, 30]}, "1": {"description": "This is a cozy italian wine/small plates venue in the basement of another restaurant.

One of the reds I tried was the most memorable wine I've ever had.For food, we had the butternut gnocchi and the honey bruschetta; both were tasty and recommended.

To start with, the small room had been booked for a private party on the weeknight I went. The host graciously offered to seat us in the Francesca's upstairs and serve us from the DiSotto menu. Regrettably, the food did not meet my expectations, given the appealing descriptions on the menu and the generous reviews posted by other diners. To their credit, the staff in Francesca's was courteous and attentive.We ordered Carciofo Arancini (OK flavors, though the date puree was sweeter than I expected), Polpette di Melanzane (eggplant balls were OK, but the dish was a bit gloppy), Barbabietole (sweeter and sharper than I'd like), and Porchetta e Pepe (the porchetta wrapped in pork belly was a good idea, but sooo salty, and the accompanying fried gnocchi were rubbery). All in all, the flavor balance was not so good.Maybe it's just a personal preference thing, but DiSotto just didn't do it for me. Maybe things are better if you dine in the enoteca.

It's probably my fault trying to get a table on weekends in a popular place that doesn't take reservations but all four times they had private events with no room for other patrons.When I was about to give up on trying, I stumbled upon dinner reservation at Francesca's through work, which is their main restaurant upstairs. On my way to the restaurant I called Disotto, and luckily they were able to accommodate us in the wine bar downstairs (Disotto). To my surprise it was completely empty throughout our three-hour dinner. Sure, it was a Monday night, but once I got to see the wine bar I could understand why it was so hard to get in. It's a small, cozy area next to the wine cave and small bar with a handful of tables. A perfect place to host a small business event or party for a small group (less than 30). With a dim, relaxed and comfortable ambience and it can cater to both a casual romantic date night and after-hour drinks with coworkers or friends. Service was attentive if a bit slowWhile they did not offer cocktails off the menu this particular night, I ordered Vesper (which is actually on their cocktail menu) and they were happy to serve a well-made drink. Their wine list is not too extensive yet interesting although they did not have four out of five bottles of wine I asked for in stock.Last but not least: foodThe gave us the menu for Francesca's to order from.Antipasti selections were decent. We tried carpaccio, gamberi (shrimps), fried calamari, mussels in tomato sauce. Despite my bias towards food with ingredients from the ocean, carpaccio was my favorite. Thinly sliced raw sirloin was nicely complemented by capers, mushroom, and lemon. For main dishes we had linguini alla sora assunta (scallop and spinach), Vitello con polenta (veal), pollo con spinaci, and roasted red grouper. They were quite filling but none super memorable. Grouper dish was my favorite. We finished the meal with Torta Lava (lava cake with mint chocolate gelato) and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes pretty good even with a full stomach.After all, I'm glad I got to try Disotto - it gets solid 3.5 stars which I rounded up to 4. Since we ordered food off Francesca's menu it may not be a fair rating but running out of several wines for a wine bar seemed a bit odd. Would I go back? There are many other places I would rather try before returning to Disotto, although if I'm in neighborhood I wouldn't mind walking in to catch up with a friend.

We were here on a Monday evening and our first reaction was why is no one here?! We were literally the only ones here though two other parties arrived later on in the night. Others stopped by and quickly left due to the lack of patrons, but they decided too hastily!Once you step into this place, you feel as if you've just walked into a grotto or an intimate cavern so it definitely has a romantic and rustic feel. I can imagine this place can get quite busy during the weekend dinner times, so make sure to get here early to snag your table.The wine selection is quite extensive and while the food choices seem limited, everything we tried was outstanding though be warned that a number of the dishes come with bread so be prepared for a carb overload! :)All dishes are meant to be shared family style and most closely resemble small plates like Quartino's or a tapas place.

It was a cool mini super market with many different offerings for prepared foods and groceries. When I looked at the prices, I was stoked. The prices at Potash Bros JHC are really reasonable (being that I'm used to South Loop Market prices). Sometimes they have special discounts on popular items that are pretty competitive with any larger chain supermarket. The fact that this is right above my office is just the clincher. However, this location is only accessible to tenants that either work or live at the John Hancock. If you are so fortunate to be in the building, this is a great convenient way to grab a quick bite or grab a few grocery items. Here are a few items I have tried at the prepared food section. Soup and Half Sandwich Combo - They have a great deal on a cup of soup and half sandwich at $5.99. The food is not very good, but it's passable. The bread is a bit stale, and the soups are a bit inconsistent. But the price is relatively low, and it keeps you full. I got a roast beef sandwich and the chicken wrap. For soups I have tried the chicken noodle, the cream of chicken and wild rice, and the chili. The soups were a bit salty and not memorable, while the sandwich was below average (even with Boar's Head meat). Broiled Chicken Wing Combo - You get 6 broiled (look and tasted fried) wings with a handful of fries. Unfortunately, they won't let you substitute out the fries for a different side, but it was still a good amount of food for $6. The wings are a bit salty, and the fries are a bit soggy and uninteresting. But it's passable. Overall, this is a sweet place due to the convenience factor.

So I called this spa and asked if it is ok and good for them if I pay in the office. They told me yes. (And this is my first mistake)After this I asked front dest lady how long will it take. And she told me it will be about 1-1,15 hour. This was very important for me because I have a 5 month old baby and I had to ask baby sitter to come and I had to tell my baby sitter when I come back. After this I called this spa 3 times to reschedule because of my baby and they confirmed me that time.So on that day I came there on time. Almost immediately the lady picked me up. In the beginning we started to discuss money. I wanted to do 2 middle area and one large areas. I told her this and I told her I want to buy one coupon for this and do 3 on that day and 3 on another day. That lady started to tell me that I can't buy 6 procedures for medium area. Ok I was agree and I offered her if I just buy 6 procedures for large areas and she will do 2 medium and 1 large on this money. She was not agree. I tried to understand and we were spending about 15 min of discussing. She told me that I have to pay 6 procedures for extra large areas and we will do 3 today (remember it was just 2 medium - underarm and bikini and one large - half legs). I was solo upset so ok I was agreed and I was thinking I was wrong. I told her lets start asap. The \u00a0she asked me did you shave? I told her no nobody told me this (I did laser hair removal in another spa and they told me I shouldn't shave 2-3 days before the laser). She told me - oh ok - I have to shave you and you have to spend additional 15 or 50$ on this) AND you know I spend so much time discussing with you money that I do not have time to finish all 3 areas. I was shocked. I called the spa several times to confirm time, we spend max 20 min for all this staff and she is telling me please pay me for shaving and maybe I won't finish all areas!!!Is it normal???I told her I won't pay and see asked manager.I told the manager that story almost crying and she told me yes I understand you and I have to check with front desk! Is it normal? Also she told me that is If didn't shave at home they will charge me for this!!! Yes I started to tell her that it is not normal and I don't lie and she asked me if I want to go out!!!!! What???Ahh I forgot the lady who told me that I have to buy 3 extra large areas asked me if I live close by and I can go there and shave!! yes i live in downtown but i don't want to go home, shave and go back!So now I think it was emotional abuse or smth like this, I do not have other words. In the end I agreed with everything because I wanted to finish all this. And this is was my second mistake - I had to go out after all this terrible things.So yes in the end they shaved me with the shave very quickly - 2 min and did 3 areas in 10 min - very very quickly also.And yes I paid like for 6 extra large. And yes the lady who told me this she told me we did 3 extra large and 3 I will do next time.I left and felt terrible.I found other deals on groupon and I even called them and they told me they would charge me the same amount for 12 procedures not for 6 as I was told here.After this i called my husband who is a top manager in international company here. I told him this and he told me it is terrible and it is first time he meets so awful people who behave like in a very cheap salon! Of course he meets many people and deals with many different situations here in Chicago.He told me I will never go to this spa again, never called nothing... I disputed a charge in Chase (thank you Chase) and they returned me money. So please do not go here or if you go - please buy the coupon :)What I want to say in the end - this spa thinks that they are expensive salon with good reputation but not after this. Me and my husband will tell as much people as we can that nobody should go there. But after this story all my friends were shocked!!! So yes this is my first and I hope last review because usually I don't care even if smth do smth bad but they try to solve this and don't lie.

I attempted to eat the tacos, which were flavorful and well presented. I picked one up and the tortilla fell apart and the fish was cold. Warning! These tacos had been setting under a heatlamp for sometime getting cold and saturated with moisture. If I had more time I would've waited for them to fix the dish.

I'm from NY so went to Yelp to guide my search. The 3 best rated salons nearby were all booked up so I stumbled into Tran's and at that point didn't bother looking it up, just sat down. Quite possibly the worst manicure I've ever gotten. I won't even get into the atmosphere, which is depressing and unsanitary to say the least. The manicure itself started off ok until my technician put on latex gloves to apply my lotion. She turned her mismatched gloves inside out in an effort I can only imagine is to use them a second time?? Well, the powder coating that's on the inside of the gloves mixed in with the lotion and had an awful granular feeling on my skin. It really grossed me out. No hot towel, just wiped off the excess lotion with a dry wash cloth. The worst part was the nail polish she used. The top coat was clearly ancient (it's too thick and doesn't spread correctly). I knew it was trouble the second I saw it. They also don't have real nail dryers, just asked me to put my hands in front of a tiny fan. I could have blown on my nails with faster results. Sure enough a half hour later, back at my hotel, I look at my hands and the nail polish on my thumbs has been completely smudged, almost wiped off. I immediately return to ask that they fix them and instead of taking off all of the polish on those fingers to redo them, she insists dabbing them with remover and just layering more gooped up polish on top. Needless to say, they all smudged again by the end of the night and I'll be redoing them myself tonight before the wedding. I should also mention that I went with a friend. I was charged $15 for a manicure, she was charged $18 for the exact same thing. Didn't realize the discrepancy until later that night but, wtf?

When she trimmed my nails, she gathered the clippings in a paper napkin, then emptied the napkin on the floor... The nasty carpeted floor... Which another woman was walking barefoot across.

We were promptly seated in a large circular table in the corner, and everything started off well. We got multiple appetizers, which were great, but I noticed that no one was bussing our table. There were two instances where servers saw our table with empty plates, but no one came over. They forgot a drink and then the entrees came and there were still dirty, empty plates on the table. They bussed the table while putting the entrees down, but some plates were still left at the table. I found this totally strange, as dirty plates should be taken pretty quickly. My entree was not cooked all the way through - the pasta was very underdone. I would have said something to our server, but he never came to ask how the food was, and they were only servicing half of the table. I understand if it was hard to get to the other side of the table, being in the corner and all, but they were aware we were coming and could have prepared better. Anyway, with the dirty plates, lack of service, and my undercooked entree, I decided to say something to the manager. We were there to impress this colleague, and I did not want her to notice that things were amiss. I went to the host stand and asked for the manager. Elliot introduced himself, and I explained the situation. He apologized and fixed everything! Our table was taken care of - no more dirty plates, water and drinks for all, and he threw in free dessert for the table. Our colleague did not notice anything and had a fantastic time at dinner.

When you're finished, head to the register and you pay by the number of ounces that you're froyo weighs.

They also offer an all natural chicken sandwich, a free-range turkey burger, a vegetarian sandwich & a chopped chicken salad if beef isn't your baby!\u00a0If you are counting carbs or calories, or follow a paleo diet, you can request your sandwich or burger to be \"salad-style\" which is lettuce-wrapped at no extra charge.I ordered a\u00a0salad-style, free-range turkey burger with tomato & pickles. The burger was juicy & tasty but the lettuce-wrapping was a MF fail! There was only a few pieces of limp, iceberg lettuce draped over the top of the burger nothing around the bottom. A pre-schooler coulda wrapped better than that! The burger was only $3.99 so maybe I shouldn't complain as I'm used to paying at least $10 for a t-bird at most places. FYI: The burger should be completely wrapped in one tight, neat, cohesive, crisp lettuce \"bun\" like they do at Five Guys & In-N-Out. This isn't brain surgery people!I got a side order of M Fries which only comes in one size for $2.29. You get a bag the size a lil bigger than a small-size fry at McDonalds. M fries are kinda similar to McD's fries too except a lil fancier. These skinny guys are natural-cut & tossed in sea salt. Not the best or worst fries I've ever had, but they're pretty Mmm tasty!\u00a0Some M-iscellaneous notes:The restaurant is small, not a lot of seating; self-serve fountain drinks; yummy-looking soft-serve: all natural, low-fat M ice cream & shakes sold but I didn't try; food is made-to-order & they call out your number when it's ready to be picked up at the counter.\u00a0(Also, luv the restaurant name, M is my fave letter!)I had a taste for a burger so I stopped to eat here while I was shopping at the Water Tower Place. Would I make a special trip to this M Burger just to eat here if I wasn't shopping in the Water Tower, Mmm no.\u00a0But\u00a0I was impressed that M Burger offers a free-range turkey burger for $3.99 albeit unimpressed by the shoddy wrap-job!

For the category in which it's meant to be judged (fast food burger not gourmet burger), M Burger is pretty darn good.

The selection is incredibly vast for a cafeteria styled eatery. The offerings change from day to day and there are always interesting options to try. While many of the more famous restaurants on the list don't typically bring their signature dishes, they still bring quality in the dishes they do serve. There many things to like about FoodEase -- Huge selection of foods... hot foods, soups, made to order sandwiches, extensive salad bar, wrapped foods to go, sushi... etc. - quality ingredients and preparation from some of the great restaurants in Chicago- I have yet to encounter a really busy time, so its usually fast and painless to go through, make your selection, and enjoy your food- a nice seating area with a TV and a stand alone bar- very nice reusuable plastic containers for your foods, and small discount if you use a plate (dining in). So an underlining theme of going Green (if you're into that sort of thing).In the couple of times I've been in there have been a very small amount of bad things that I've noticed about FoodEase. - this only pertains to the hot food, but some of the food that sits out too long tends to get very dry. Causing the consistency of some of the items to go down. Some of the items are storage proof, some aren't. \u00a0And it's difficult to make that assumption just by looking at the food. - the different number of restaurant offerings will cause some foods to be very goods and some not so much based purely on preference. - it does get a bit pricey for what you're getting. A trip there is usually $10+ without a drink, with a very moddest pile of protein and veggies (and a splash of carbs). While I have no issues paying that at a sit down place, I still haven't gotten over the sticker price shock of paying that for cafeteria styled food. Overall, it's a great option in the area.

Now, keep in mind that this is a \"health conscious\" type of restaurant so some of you may not give this place a chance but you need to take my word and most of the reviewers words and try it out! Some dishes I found to be very tasty were: the garlic noodles, vegetable empanada, carnitas, anything with quinoa, and a very interesting buffalo lasagna. I made of mistake of not trying a dessert even though a Chicago local told me that their brownies were one of the best. I guess I will just have to visit again. Unfortunately I was too fixated on the food on my plate to know how much the prices were but it is calculated by a certain $ per pound.

Our interests were piqued when we found that a few of the Chicago breweries we'd been meaning to try were going to be at Foodease all at the same time. The event was only $10 and I would say we got our money's worth.Location: Foodease wasn't hard to find in the overly-packed, sometimes-confusing Water Tower Plaza. Up the escalator to the 2nd floor, then down the other set of escalators to get to the mezzanine. Once you're on the Mez, you'll see a bunch of other restaurants and it's a matter of time before your eyes are zoned in on Foodease. I was really excited to see they offer a ton of fresh and local food options and that was the first thing that caught my eye.There was a bar and also a small area with tables for people to come in and grab a quick bite. The event itself was back past the wine into a back room. The room was smallish and definitely not enough room for all of the people trying to grub and drink.Food: There were a few different things offered. Foodease offered homemade pretzels with beer cheese and also pork sliders braised in Revolution's Eugene Porter. I liked the beer cheese, but the pretzels didn't do it for me -- they could have been softer and warmer. The pork sliders were the highlight of my night though. The guy serving was really nice and didn't judge me when I asked for seconds. There was also a cheese tray in the middle of the room, where I found myself standing most of the night.I also got to discover Big Fork brands, which is bacon sausage made in Chicago. Holy cow - that stuff is good. No longer do you have to choose between bacon and sausage. You can have both! I checked out the website and there's a bunch of locations around the city and 'burbs that sell it, so I'll be buying it soon. (It's also sold at Foodease, but I didn't want to have to carry it around since we were going to be going a few places afterward.)Beer: Finch, Revolution, Two Brothers and Metropolitan all made it out. Half Acre was supposed to be there, but weren't for some reason -- boo! Getting to talk to all of the brewers was the best part. It's great to learn a little bit more about the tastes and history of the brewery and the beer itself. My favorite beer of the night was the banana beer from Two Brothers. I bought some that night :)Overall: the event was a lot of fun and I'm so glad I went. We only stayed about 40 minutes as I am a little bit of a people phobe and can only take being smushed for so long. Other than the lack of space, the event was a success!

Who puts a wine bar in a mall! \u00a0I first went to Foodease because I heard that they had wine on tap and I keep coming back because of the easy to drink wine options, endless food options, atmosphere and favorite bartenders. Seating: The bar has 12 seats and we've never ran into a situation where we didn't get seats, but occasionally we may have to wait a few minutes for two seats to open up next to one another. Usually pretty quick turnover with the people who just stop mid-shopping, but it's surprising how many regulars are there every week who will set up shop there for the day. Food: the wine bar has a small menu of meat and cheese plates and a few appetizers. These are good for a snack, but if you are looking for a full meal the cafeteria style food bar has a ton of selections. All of the food is amazing and the options are endless. The food options range from salad bar to mac and cheese, to soup and sushi. And then there is M Burger which you can eat at the wine bar. Atmosphere: It never feels crowded even when all of the seats are taken. Because there are so few seats it creates a friendly environment across the different groups there. Service: Excellent. The bartenders are all great, Ivy being a fave. Because it's such a small space customers get a lot of attention. If you are unsure about a wine they will offer you some to taste. Wine Cellar: If you like any of the wine you try, you can pick up a bottle at the wine cellar. They have a good selection of inexpensive wine. They will have complementary wine tasting events in the cellar as well which is a great way to try their wines. If you are shopping in the area or live nearby this is a must do.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 4]}, "14": {"description": "Cons: $11 is a lot for chips and a sandwich (Shout out to Hannah's Bretzel for also eclipsing the $10 threshold.
