My first visit was a year ago, I called them up because they are one of the only salons nearby, and made an appointment with Michael, based on reviews from Yelp. I showed up, and loved the decor, but was very surprised by Michael, who wasn't very interested in asking me any detailed questions about what I wanted done with my hair. He cut my hair based on the few directions of, I want some layers. The result was not at all what I had in mind, and I really wished that he had discussed what he was going to do. He also seemed to be smirking at me the entire time, and afterwards, and I really felt like walking out without giving him a tip at all, I was so dissatisfied. About three months ago, I was desperately in need of another hair cut, and so I called to make another appointment. This time they told me my appointment was with Meseret, the owner, and I was thrilled to avoid the grumpy, smirking Michael. However, upon showing up and checking in, without any explanation at all, I was handed over to Michael again. I was very surprised that they didn't even notify me of the change in plans upon checking in, or any questioning of if the switch was acceptable to me or not. Fortunately, this time Michael seemed to be in a very good mood, quite chatty, and we discussed the hair cut quite a bit, and I was very pleased with the result. I loved it! He took my basic ideas of what I wanted, and turned my hair into one of the recent fashions he'd found somewhere, and it was perfect. I'm not sure how I feel about making another appointment with them after these two very different experiences with the SAME stylist. And also, though they advertise the Tuesday special as including a wash, cut, AND dry, the receptionist tried to charge me EXTRA for the blow dry. I was horrified! She said my hair was longer and took longer and that's why they were going to charge extra. I argued, saying it didn't give any hint of this on the website, and she finally, very grumpily, didn't charge me extra, but kept trying to give me a guilt trip. It was awful!!! I am definitely NOT happy with the receptionist and their duplicity about hidden fees and discrimination against those of us with longer hair.

The receptionist made a little face, but did rearrange everything, and, five minutes later, Skip was washing my hair. Skip has been at 57th for quite awhile, and I knew I was in good hands. While he washed my hair, he chatted with Meseret, the owner. Now, I adore Meseret. She is funny, tells it like it is, and bends over backwards to take care of her clients. Several years ago when I was more of a strawberry blonde with highlights under Meseret's care, a trip to the salon would mean that I would have coffee purchased for me, and once, even Thai food. Anyway, Skip was telling Meseret about his new maple floors he was putting into the house he inherited from his mother. He momentarily abandoned me at his station to show Meseret pictures! That was a little annoying, but just one of the typical quirks of the place. While blowing and straightening my hair, Skip and I chatted about mansions in America that you can tour. He's been to the Biltmore several times, and, since I adore Asheville and have also been to the Biltmore, it was a lovely conversation. Skip also commented on my wonderful haircut, and asked if Meseret had cut it. \"No,\" I said guiltily, \"I went to Twisted Scissors in Logan Square.\" I told him that I had it cut a month ago, and, while he praised its shape, said he would trim the neck hairs for me. Twenty minutes later, my hair was sleek and smooth, and the stack was appropriately teased. Skip sprayed it on the heavy side, since the wind was fierce last night, and he wanted me to look \"stunning all night.\" But with Aveda hairspray, your hair never gets crunchy or gross. Will I abandon Jamie and Twisted Scissors? Never! But, it's great to know that 57th is just down the street in case of an emergency.

The store itself is huge, occupying the old Borders bookstore space. I went there after the Thanksgiving weekend opening and had mixed feelings.

I only found clothing from the Akira brand, which is actually quite affordable, but then again, lacking the quality of the more expensive brands. This would be fine if they stocked more \"down to earth\" kind of clothes. Instead, what you will find are crazy sequined cocktail dresses, neon horrific patterned tights, oversized baggy sweaters, and other oddly dowdy shirts mixed in. I can see them hitting it off with people who want to go clubbing and need to grab a cheap dress, but in order to appeal to the wider Hyde Park demographic, they will need to really rethink who they are targeting and bring in some more indie/hipster/cute designs that most college students and young professionals go for these days.

I went on a date to this place and was making an attempt to spark up some nostalgia for an hour or two. But that idea was halted. The new staff members are very abrasive. We were done with our dinner and was told at the last minute that we couldn't pay with a card because the machine was down. No one said anything before hand. So I asked to speak with a manager because I didn't want to use the atm and rack up even more charges (on top of the expensive bill). He made us wait for a good 20 minutes so I got impatient. I was unable to hide my annoyance because we didn't have long before the parking meter garnered us a ticket. The \"bouncers \" began surrounding the front door on some \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS\" type of thing and appeared to be there for us. I guess we were technically being held at ransom and I had to find out what the price was. Finally we got our napkin (appearantly a.k.a receipt) and it was almost half off. But the cost was that I had to use their atm. Needless to say we ended up getting our $75.00 ticked from the beautiful people over at the Chicago police department.

It wasn't the championship- probably the 2nd round or so. We went around 5p on a Friday. They were relatively busy but we were able to get seated right away. It went downhill from there. We asked the server if she would ask to get the TV changed. I shit you not (we timed it), it took over an hour. Alright, fine. We'll improvise.... let's watch on the phone. Then we each ordered a drink, and they were 10 bucks a piece. Alright, fine. I would have liked to see a price on the menu, but it's not a big deal. We ordered the bruschetta, and it came out just before our drinks. About 20 minutes for both. We ate it quickly and noticed that the people in the booth behind us finished their meal and left. Then, for the rest of the time we were there, the tables were not cleared. There were at least 3 tables just covered with napkins and what not. What the hell? We ordered a quesadilla (I don't know why. Moment of weakness, and I was freaking hungry) and it took 45 or so minutes to come out. OMG. By then we were pissed, still hungry, not watching the game, and just ready to go home. We could barely flag the waitress down (but don't worry, I saw her getting her smoke break!) and just paid and bolted. I blame the managers. The servers were slow, but I'm pretty sure they were the bus boys, servers, food runners.... shit. They may have been cooking the food too for all I know.All in all, DON'T go here. Just don't.

Once we were seated and our orders were placed, the next two hours were full of disappointment. We placed our drink orders and it took 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after asking for water twice they were never brought to the table. Next, when the drinks were finally brought to the table, there were errors with the drinks. One drink was missed and another was incorrectly made. The specialty drink that was incorrectly made did not have the proper ingredients (clearly evident based on appearance) as listed in the menu and based on prior experience with the drink at other Bar Louie locations (missing the berries that are usually mixed into the drink to add fruit flavor). The server then had us taste the drink which did not taste like it had on prior occasions. The request was that the typical berries be added to complete the flavor. The staff rudely stated this wouldn't change the flavor and brought it back to the bar and appeared frustrated. She returned 10 minutes later to tell me they refused to remake the drink because they think it would taste the same and it would be a waste of alcohol. This was after only requesting that the missing ingredients be added (strawberries and raspberries) and not to remake a drink. She then continued to tell me it wouldn't change the flavor and returned twice to the manager (who was also the bartender), who refused to make the drink. This was getting out of control and we asked to speak directly with the manager (our server said his name was \"Al\" - but they would not provide his last name after asking several time, stated they also don't have business cards) who refused to come to the table and would only communicate through the server going back and forth from the table. Eventually they decide to make the drink but they said they would only do it after making all the other customers drinks. By the time the drink was served, all the other members of the party had finished their food and drinks (~1 hour 40 minutes after arriving) and this was when we received our appetizer as well (we placed our order for an appetizer 10 minutes after the others in our party ordered). When the drink finally came with how it was described on the menu, it tasted like it had in the past, when the ingredients were present. The server was rude in that she attempted to place the blame on me on being difficult to order a drink when all I wanted was the drink I typically order and how it is described on the menu. She also repeatedly made the point that she was yelled at by her manager because of us. Besides this she was helpful and remained calm and for the most part friendly.

She could've brainstormed some options and asked me what would work best for me as the customer. \u00a0 Here is a thought, ask...is there someone else I can schedule you with? \u00a0or Your brows are on me to today for this inconvenience, we will take you in the next 30 minutes (or so). \u00a0 \u00a0There was no personal touch or top notch customer service given by the manager. \u00a0 Again, thank goodness my aesthetician was so accommodating and quickly addressed the situation. \u00a0I was willing to compromise because again, I understood it was simple mistake. \u00a0 As a loyal customer I was owed a reasonable response. \u00a0This is only one example in the theme of how I am treated as a customer. \u00a0I have been loyal to benefits for nearly 5 years and after all of this time I am still disappointed with the level of service I receive when escalating matters to the manager. \u00a0Because Tracy is so professional and respectful of my time, I continue \u00a0to return.", "rating": "3"}, "35": {"date": [2014, 10, 8], "description": "Recently went here to get my eyebrows threaded and wasn't really blown away.

In a female dominated industry, what better idea than a Benefit party complete with spray tans, brow and lash treatments, makeup - etc.Unfortunately, a few of our party members were running late for our 5pm start time. So as one of the first ones there, I just started herding our guests in one by one on a rolling basis so that we wouldn't waste any time, seeing as were a party of 10. As a side note, my boss made a reservation with them THREE MONTHS in advance, they knew we were coming, they knew how many, and they know how long 10 spray tans, 10 eyebrow waxes/makeup applications/tints/extensions take for 10 girls.Everything started lovely. We were trying to be as efficient as possible because we knew that there were a lot of us and that this location in LP is their busiest. We did notice another party of 4 come in, who suddenly started to get quite agitated after arriving about 30-45 minutes after we did. One of our makeup artists made a comment to a girl in our party that \"Oh yeah, that party called the other night and asked to come in tonight, but we told her we were too busy and already had a party of 10 but she INSISTED that it had to be tonight and no other\". We were pleased they were still accommodating us first and appreciated that they honored we had made our reservations further in advance. How nice!At one point we realized our party had been chatting it up for about 30 minutes, and yet none of the girls were being serviced...Interesting...suddenly we note that all 4 members of the party who were told not to come that evening were getting tans, getting waxed...and wrapping up their entire evening. Weird - right?Suddenly, we realize we're late for our 8p dinner reservation. So, my boss strolls over to the woman who I assume is the manager and whose name I sadly forget and says to her very nicely, \"I'm sorry, but it's now been over 3 hours, and a few girls still haven't had their spray tans, however, I did notice that the party who arrived after us is already done\". This is when the story gets REAL rich. The manager, completely avoiding eye contact with my boss, \"Well, that woman comes in here every week, so we gave her some special treatment.\"I ask you all to please keep in mind that for TEN woman, having a party like this costs well over $1,000. So, what Benefit is saying is, we just dropped more than a thousand dollars at your store in under 3 hours, but we won't be receiving any special treatment? My boss just about lost it at this point, we were also quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of clients.To add insult to injury, when you have one of these \"parties\" they give everyone a $50 gift card. They don't really tell you this rule flat out, it's hinted at it but never explicitly said - you HAVE to spend it that night, right there on product, even if you don't want it. Since we were running late for dinner, myself and a couple other girls left in a rush to make sure we still held our reservation, we did so without buying product, sort of just assuming we'd get a spray tan or something else at a future date. Let me tell you folks - the manager totally freaked out over this one. She INSISTED my boss call myself and the other clients I left with, have us leave the restaurant, and come back IMMEDIATELY to use our gift cards to buy product. We did not do that, we stayed at the restaurant waiting for the rest of our party to finish up their services, as we didn't want to be rude to the restaurant. And future reference to other party goers - if you don't want to buy the product right there, don't! Just save it, use it at a later date. It's totally ok!While I love Benefit products and have had a great time here in the past, the management really ruined this for all of us there, and nobody has been to a Benefit since.

A nice hot, greasy, gigantic pile of beef and fermented cabbage wedged between slices of rye, with melty swiss and thousand island that oozes out as you bite. Pre-Bergstein's, my options were slim. I like Windy's deli, but their reuben isn't a reuben in the traditional sense and doesn't quite satisfy in the same way. Morry's is good, but on the absolute other end of Hyde Park so I don't get over there often. Bergstein's definitely fills that reuben gap in my life, although I cringe every time I fork over the $13 it ends up being. My first experience with Bergstein's actually wasn't in one of these reuben-seeking moods of mine, but actually with the cold sandwiches they send to one of the cafes on campus. I got the Smokey Joe, which I enjoyed, although I'm sure the fishiness didn't please those around me too much. I actually haven't seen that particular sandwich being stocked recently, and it's not on the menu online, but I did order it in-restaurant last week. The generous layer of whitefish salad can be overwhelmingly fishy and salty after a couple of bites which makes the sandwich hard to finish, but I do enjoy it. That said, the reuben will remain my steady order. Although it's almost prohibitively expensive, and comes on rather small slices of bread, it is meaty and gooey as it should be. I also appreciate that it comes with sides. The potato salad and coleslaw are both good, and I have done the upgrade to potato pancakes. The pancakes aren't like mother used to make, being rather small, heavily deep-fried, and heavier on the sweet onions than I would like (and the potato is grated very, very fine so that the texture isn't as interesting as I'm used to), but they're still potato pancakes and they come with plenty of applesauce and sour cream. They sell bottles of Dr. Brown soda, and also have a drink fountain which has the normal options alongside Barq's red cream soda. I'm a great lover of cream soda, but the red cream has a strong artificial bubblegum-ish taste to it which is a little much for me - I'll stick to the Dr. Brown in future.

That's a half pound sandwich made of freshly-made ingredients and I'm willing to pay $13 for the quality of that brisket alone. You also get a bag of chips with your sandwich and they've got delicious chocolate cookies for sale.

Quality of cut: 4Customer service: 1length of time spent: 1price: 1location: 4conversation with the barber: \u00a03 The story: This place is not bad...but it depends on what you're looking for. \u00a0The men all do good quality work cutting hair, but it lost a few stars for me for a few reasons.I'm new to Hyde park and was looking for a place to take care of my beautiful locks (you know, all 3 inches or so).I read reviews and saw that it was a cheap cut, which is what I was looking for (i'm on a budget and was honestly considering just buzzing my own this time because even $15 feels like more than I wanted to spend right now). \u00a0Sadly that wasn't the case. (scroll down if you just want to see the price)Around 4pm on a Saturday I called in advance to see if they what time they closed. \u00a0He told me they normally close at six but just come in and he'll get me in. \u00a0It sounded like they had barbers open from what he communicated. \u00a0I headed over around 5pm figuring an hour was plenty of time to give him for the cut and not keep him after hours. Side note/context of my experience. \u00a0I was hungry so I decided to order something online from Cafe 53 which is across the street. \u00a0I included a message saying that I wouldn't arrive until between 5:40 and 6PM. \u00a0So I walked in around 5:05PM. Each of the three barbers were giving someone a cut. \u00a0No one said anything to me. \u00a0Not one barber said \"hi\" or \"welcome\" or \"are you here for a cut?\" or \"do you have an appointment?\" or \"were you the one I just talked to on the phone?\" or \"i'll be right with you!\" or \"have a seat, you'll be next\" or \"sorry we're full today\" or anything. \u00a0Just nothing was said. \u00a0They all certainly looked up and saw me walk in, it was awkward and uncomfortable (this is coming from someone who rarely feels uncomfortable). \u00a0So I sat down and waited next to a fella who seemed to be waiting for his buddy to finish his cut and maybe get a cut himself. \u00a0I don't need any red carpet to be thrown out, but a simple acknowledgement that you see a customer is generally good practice. \u00a0A really weird movie was playing, and the guys were talking about something so I jumped into the conversation. \u00a0They responded and acknowledged my presence, but still nothing was said about a haircut. \u00a0Sure I didn't ask at this point, but should I have to? One barber finished his cut and took the next guy (the only other person waiting) before me. \u00a0I figured I was next and would take whoever finishes soonest. \u00a0The 2nd barber finished; but didn't look at me. \u00a0He casually went to the back first. \u00a0Then he came back and swept. \u00a0He said nothing to me. \u00a0I thought maybe he would finish sweeping and say \"sorry for the wait, come on up\" or \"ok man what can I do for you\"....still nothing. \u00a0He started checking his phone and took a call. \u00a0About 12 awkward minutes later one of the barbers left and asked the one guy who was still working on a client if he had any other cuts today, and then he pointed at me. \u00a0Ok thank goodness I was allowed to be in this place. \u00a0Meanwhile 5:40PM passed. \u00a0To spare you spending the amount of time I did; i'll just tell you it was 7:40PM by the time I got out of there. (this experienced definitely spread a little poo on my party because it meant my dinner was soggy by the time I was able to pick it up) The haircut was great, but it wasn't exactly what I asked for. \u00a0I asked the man to thin out the beard a bit, and take next to nothing off the top, just kind of even it out (I should have specified no more than a cm). \u00a0He took to much off the top and the beard. \u00a0My beard is very upset with me, but it's hardly a beard anymore so it doesn't even have the energy to yell. \u00a0Now, like a rookie, I failed to ask for price beforehand and just assumed it would be cheap because of yelp reviews...it wasn't. \u00a0When we finished the man asked me for THIRTY dollars (that's at least five good burritos right there), and I paid him, plus a five dollar tip. \u00a0A better tip might have been to remind him to acknowledge a customer when they walk in (even a \"welcome to blues\" with a middle finger would have been more than the silence I walked into). To be fair he cleaned up my beard which likely added to the price. The second rookie mistake (which really applies to any shop) is you never want to go in pushing closing time. \u00a0The conversation was decent, and the cut was good, but I probably won't be back. \u00a0Again these were good dudes that gave good cuts, but I won't be paying to come back and let any more sandwiches go soggy. happy haircuts to you my friends!", "rating": "2"}, "2": {"date": [2015, 8, 15], "description": "I only gave two stars for gp.

The bread. \u00a0I can't find another baguette like theirs - light yet substantial, not too crusty. \u00a0So after a few weeks of regularly ordering the same sandwich (I know what I like) the woman making the sandwiches would start making mine the moment I walked through the door. \u00a0This went on for a few months. \u00a0I really appreciated that this woman actually remembered me and that I rarely had to wait for my food. \u00a0So one day I gave the girl serving me a $5 bill and asked her to give it to the woman who made the sandwiches. \u00a0The woman came out from the back, smiling, and with a heavy French accent said \"No, it's ok, they pay me well enough.\" \u00a0A few years later the woman making the sandwiches stopped making sandwiches and took over running the front. \u00a0I'm assuming this is who people are referring to as the owner. \u00a0She certainly acts a bit more haughty now, but calling her rude would be ridiculous to me. Let's clear one thing up now: \u00a0They only make a certain number of baguettes each day, and when they're gone that's it. \u00a0I love to spread a soft cheese on their baguettes for a nice lunch, but many days I've shown up too late and left disappointed. \u00a0For anyone wondering, it's a lot more profitable to sell a sandwich than to just sell the baguette - you can get 3-4 sandwiches out of one baguette - and this is why you might have to fight for a piece. \u00a0I note the supply/demand issue with baguettes so my last story makes sense. \u00a0One day I went to get a baguette and there was a long line, but the staff who work there are pretty fast and it moves quickly. \u00a0This time, however, a customer was standing at the register forcefully asking if she had the right size coffee. \u00a0She ordered a large, and it wasn't large enough to her - to me, it was a lot of coffee. \u00a0After the girl at the register explained that the customer was indeed holding a large coffee, the show started. \u00a0She demanded to speak to the manager, the owner, whoever was there. \u00a0The girl at the register explained that talking to the owner won't help, but eventually relented. \u00a0Now, if you've seen the man who does the baking then you probably know where this is going. \u00a0He came out from the back, walked up to the counter, and was completely confused as to why he was there. \u00a0The girl at the register explained the situation, the customer reiterated that her coffee should be larger, and the man simply stated \"You want more coffee? Go to McDonald's!\". \u00a0The customer was flabbergasted. \u00a0She stammered to ask for her money back but he just told her to get out. \u00a0Maybe I'm a bad person, but I started to laugh. \u00a0The poor girl working the register was trying to clear out the even longer line that had formed, so by the time it was my turn I just handed her some cash and turned to walk away. \u00a0She tried to stop me to give me change but I just chuckled and said it was alright.A few weeks later I came in to get a baguette. \u00a0There didn't seem to be any left, but when I'm desperate sometimes I ask anyway, to feel like I tried. \u00a0A different girl was working the register and she, as usual, apologized that there were none left. \u00a0Just as I was about to walk away, the girl from before came over from the espresso machine and said \"Wait!\" - a few seconds later a baguette appeared from nowhere, and with a smile I was on my way. Yes, they don't treat their staff very well. \u00a0Yes, they can be brusque/rude. \u00a0No, you shouldn't have to put up with that - you're quite welcome to avoid Bonjour altogether. \u00a0That being said, I wouldn't trade this place for the world and I'll truly miss it if I ever leave Chicago.", "rating": "5"}, "49": {"date": [2014, 1, 11], "description": "Wonderful bakery.

Secondly he used SOOO much ice, in the description it said it would be mixed with fruit so I thought it would be frozen fruit for the thickness. NO, I didn't see him add any frozen fruit, he added ice instead and that completely through me off cause I've had the bowls from other places before and I know that would only make the consistency watery!

I asked the guy working if he could use a whole banana instead of a half of one and he rudely tells me \"no, a full banana won't fit....\" It would have fit it he added less ice and put a little less product inside the bowl. It was SOOO much left over in the blender that I know his proportions were off.

It was a Sunday morning and me and my workout partner decided to go for a run on the lake front in Hyde Park. After a great run, we decided to walk over to Bonne Sante for wheat grass shots and smoothies. What we didn't know is the juice bar was operating under winter hours (through the first weekend of May), and they were closed on Sundays! LE SIGH! So, an employee (maybe owner) of the store, George, informed us of this and we were visibly sadden by this. He then asked us, what we needed it and we told him. He didn't say, \"well, come back tomorrow, or reiterate the winter hours\". His words were, \"give me a second, I can help you guys out\". WHAAAATTTTT???? Yeah, they were closed! George proceeded to get everything he needed to prepare our wheatgrass shots and smoothies. What we didn't expect was for a million other people to trickle in, think the juice bar was open, and order smoothies. We felt soooo bad because he was just trying to be nice to us. However, he was nice to everyone! George probably made an additional 10 smoothies that day, on the day the juice bar was closed! He was awesome.

The sandwich pitas are tasty, and they come with a side salad, house dressing, and homemade fries only for $8.24. Sharwama's really good, while the skirt steak is good but a bit dry sometimes. And if you ever have to between the steak or short ribs, get the short ribs! The short ribs are superb, the pomegranate sauce is truly wonderful. The vegetable tangine is a must for any vegetarian, and cooked in beautiful refreshing sauce; the smell is just heavenly! The environment is super clean, and customer service is amazing. The staff are so friendly, efficient, and fast. They are very nice to all their customers. This is my favourite Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in Chicago. I eat here at least once a week so if you're in the neighbourhood then enjoy the food, and fabulous customer service.

It was your run of the mill pita bread stuffed with veggies, tasteless hummus and lamb fat. I say lamb fat because every other piece was un-chewable. I understand the spindle has fat to allow for cooking, but standarda are so low that I am now eating a shawerma with lamb fat with a side of hummus and veggies. I tried to drench it with sauces (garlic and tahini) but tahini was so watered down that it was salty water with hint of tahini. Not to mention I paid 50cents for each sauce!!!!Disappointed I opened my Shukriya dish and had my first bite. Yuck - the worst part of lamb filled with fat and coarse meat is used for this dish which supports the $9.99 price tag. Chewy and gamy to the point where my jaw hurts. \u00a0Lamb is known to be gamy but definitely tender If cooked properly. \u00a0The yogurt gravy was half decent.

Usually, when the establishment is being conservative, the bar tender measures the alcohol in the silver shot glass. Not so here. Two weeks ago, 5 of us patrons sitting outside, sent our drinks back.

See the corresponding Walgreen's and Treasure Island locations for further examples. That is, previously successful business models (like the \"fast casual\" restaurant environment of Chipotle) seem to break down and fail. I suspect these failures have been caused by three primary reasons. I'll start with the reason that is most commonly cited in the other reviews here. The service at this Chipotle (and at Treasure Island and Walgreens) is absurdly bad. I never knew that putting wrapping up a burrito or running a cash register was more difficult than heart surgery until I came here. Not only do the employees at this Chipotle make it seem like their jobs are extraordinarily challenging, they also manage to do so while being incredibly rude to their customers. You can go in here and wait in line for 20+ minutes, never even making it to the counter, while you watch 2-3 employees hopelessly construct burritos while 4 or 5 stand in the back doing nothing, and the cashier talks to their coworkers who are either off the clock or just doing nothing. Second is the breakdown of the aforementioned \"fast casual\" restaurant environment that has been so successful at other Chipotles. Most Hyde Park-ers clearly do not have a handle on what this concept means. While the line is often backed up due to poor service, the sheer number of people who call in orders creates a crazy bottleneck that can end up causing the employees to make 10+ burritos before they even get to someone who is actually physically in line. Corollary to this is the fact that many people treat this Chipotle as a dine-in experience - hardly anyone ever seems to take their orders away; they're all physically eating at the Chipotle. This necessitates the location to set aside one or two employees who are either busing tables or cleaning up. This is Chipotle! Bus your own %&$^ing table! The last reason simply has to do with the customers and their ordering behavior. Lots of people here cite the fast lines they've experienced at downtown Chipotles. Now, most people at downtown Chipotles are just getting one burrito for themselves, then they leave. I can't tell you how many times I come in here, and the customer ordering their burrito is actually taking the orders of their family members and dictating it to the employee. At another location, the employees might actually be able to handle, or at least mollify the effects of someone ordering 6 burritos at a time. But that is simple not the case here. I've been here at least a dozen times in the past two years, and at the start, I thought the employees would improve, the staff would get into their burrito-making groove, and all would be well. Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken and conditions at this Chipotle have only worsened. After going in last night around 7:00 and seeing a stationary 30+ person line, I decided to call it a day on the Hyde Park Chipotle.", "rating": "1"}, "14": {"date": [2014, 12, 18], "description": "I love chipotle but this one on specific was organized the last time i came.

Folks worked their butts off from the moment I entered until I paid and exited. During the 25+ minutes I was there, I witnessed a minimum of socializing and the teamwork seemed on par with what I see at other Chipotle's stores.Since I visit another Chipotle's twice a week during evening rush hour, I erred by expecting this even newer store to operate in a similar fashion. I was terribly disappointed. Two observations: They were terribly understaffed this afternoon. There was a larger than average number of folks ahead of me who seemed asleep or brain dead until they appeared before a staff person. Three orders before mine were changed. A young lady ahead of me was more concerned with tossing her ratty hair weave from her eyes (and into the face of the poor person behind her) and her cell phone remaining attached to her ear. She literally changed her order twice and each time was politely obliged. Another woman with three small children was unbelievable. She waited until she got before staff to negotiate with each of her children, individually, what they could and could not have. She showed NO regard for the growing line behind her and took her time. So rude. Unbelievable.I will avoid this Chipotle's in the future. It's really a shame that a popular format finally decides to come into a primarily Black neighborhood - and rest assured it will reap the investment and then some, as is typically the case (check out the data on the Starbucks on 71st & Stony) - and the experience is compromised. Based on the prior reviews, it appears this Chipotle's is having its share of problems. Folks, fairly, seem to have standard expectations and this store is falling short. Please don't take this particular clientele for granted; it deserves the very same quality of service or better, including adequate staffing, clean facilities and courteous treatment.

I'm waiting for quite a while and finally someone appears in the separate section and starts asking the line of people waiting on their online orders. She makes the other customer's order who was waiting for his online order and he then leaves. She then proceeds to do the same thing with other people who are on the side waiting for their online orders. I ask the cashier why is this taking so long when I have a 7:45pm promise time and more and more time goes by. I then tell the other customers that I think this service is terrible and I have never experienced this at any other locations where my online order is not ready upon the promise time. The woman preparing the online orders said that I had a 8:15pm promise time, but I tell her that I actually called and spoke to someone and the woman that I spoke to confirmed that she told the online order person that I did call and she told her an hour before that I needed 7:45pm instead of 8:15pm. It was 8:15pm by the time this whole conversation was occurring and my order was still not ready. I decided to leave and not give this location my business since this was truly the worst Chipotle service I have ever received in being their customer for over 12 years.

I live down the street from Clarke's and have eaten here more than enough times.Food - 3.5 StarsIf I had to give this place a review just based on the food, I would give it 3.5 stars. Because it's not an upscale restaurant whose food should be ranked top 10 in Chicago, I can't, by any means, give it anything close to 5 stars. However, Clarke's is one of the better diners I have been to. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served 24 hours a day, there are freshly made pastries, there is a turkey option, and the food is consistent. You can get 3 full course meals for under $30. Clarke's is like an off-brand IHOP with less pancake options, better tasting eggs, and burgers. The food quality is definitely on the better half of Chicago diners. Service - .5 Stars...Yes I said POINT 5 starsBefore I talk about this, please note that from December until now, the service has been excellent. They've hired some new staff like O and this white guy (forgot his name) who have been outstanding waiters. However, for the sake of the new owners making changes, I'll be writing this review for the time before December.I've been to my fair share of diners and restaurants, and let me tell you, Clarke's has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. When you first walk in, there's no host....at all. I've lived in Hyde Park for 2 years now, and, until December 2015, I've never been greeted a the door. Usually, my girlfriend and I wait about 2 minutes, get irritated, grab a few menus, and find ourselves a table. Then begins the waiting game. The busser is always helping with refilling our water glasses, but he's usually the only person we interact with for the first 5-10 minutes of stepping into the diner. Many times we're sitting by the TVs which is right in front of the juice bar where the staff is usually. So we can clearly see the staff looking at us waiting to have our orders taken. During one experience, we had our waitress come by, take our orders, clock out without placing our orders, and then wait another 20 minutes before anyone realized that our waitress had left and our orders were never placed. During another fantastic experience, 3 waiters/waitresses passed us by without taking our order. The white waiter (still can't remember his name), who was actually about to leave since his shift was up, went out of his way to ask someone to take our order. However, when they \"forgot\", he took off his coat, put down his bag, and offered to stay an extra hour to make sure we got our food. As soon as we did, I tipped him $20, and told him to leave because he shouldn't be burdened with his colleagues' terrible service or management. Lastly, it take FOREVER to get the check. Now, many are probably asking \"Why do you keep going back if the service is so bad?\" Well, considering I only live 5 minutes away walking, and it's the only place (besides Subway) opened 24 hours in Hyde Park, there aren't too many options after 10pm. Also, like a said, the food is actually pretty good. Since the beginning of December, I have seen some changes in personnel and the service has been soooo much better. I just hope the new owner can whip his manager into shape.Rant over.", "rating": "2"}, "10": {"date": [2015, 11, 28], "description": "This place is a funky mess.

WTF! Never heard that one before. He argued with us about this, even though our waiter accidentally admitted that he saw \"it did not look white.\" Under omelets it says $1.50 for each additional topping, but they charged me double that and said it was because that was the price for onions and tomatoes, not turkey sausage. Whatever. Finally, the food was absolutely flavorless. It was not good. We'll be staying by this hotel for 3 more days and we will make sure you never see another dime of our money.

But other than that, it's a fairly mediocre restaurant.", "rating": "2"}, "2": {"date": [2016, 1, 1], "description": "If I could give this place no stars or even negative stars, I'd gladly do so. I have never had such terrible service at a diner \u00a0in my entire history of having diner food. Diner food is never even that good to begin with, so to have this experience is really saying something. We (a party of 10, but one wasn't eating) arrived a little after noon and were seated quickly, which is good, but what was probably the one good thing that happened here.From then it took our server/waitress, at least 30 minutes to acknowledge us. Looked at our table a couple of times, but no one knew she worked there because she was dressed like she rolled out of bed after a real deep sleep and showed up in sleep clothes. By the time she finally acknowledged us to take orders, she stood at one end of the table and basically said \"who's ready to order\" in no particular order, not addressing anyone directly, in between orders she just says \"anyone else?\" Doing that is forcing us to shout our orders to you across the table. Good job for not taking 5 extra steps to move to the other side of the table to take orders. Maybe if you would have our orders would have been correct, but that must have been way too much to ask of a person we pay to provide a service.So with all of the orders in, we continue to wait an OBNOXIOUSLY long time for our food. Now it's understandable when you're a very large, super busy restaurant who provides something a little more complicated that chicken noodle soup and omelets, but again....maybe these are complicated orders. I think we waited, without further acknowledgement from anyone, for maybe close to an hour. To the point that we had to ask if we were forgotten. Maybe the order got lost, maybe they forgot and overlooked, but they assured us it's being made and they're busy so that's why it was taking so long.....I've seen busier places take care of our large group and still actually treat us like paying customers. So our food comes out and....let me tell you, the food seemed like it was cooked and sat there on the counter for 20 minutes before someone remembered to bring it out to us, like an afterthought. We got rice (from the burrito ) that was taken out of the fridge and served cold, an order of potatoes that seemed like it was cooked this morning and left under a slightly warm heat lamp to get soggy and slimy, an order of chicken noodle soup that came out very last, wrong orders, and missing food. So yes, some of the people in our hungover and super hungry group, regrettably, \u00a0ate what was remotely edible. Traded in then soggy potatoes for slightly less, but still soggy potatoes. We had them stick the rice in a microwave, cause rice isn't normally supposed to be served cold, but afterwards it ended up tasting like sadness, anyway. Had rye bread for a blt, but was given white, which would have never happened if my friend didn't have to shout across the table in an already not quiet diner to order it. Toast was ordered, but never dropped off. Now unless you were back there baking the bread from scratch, I don't understand how an ordet of toast could take more than 3 minutes to make, let alone never making it to the table in the hour and a half we sat there waiting. Even after reminding our waitress /server, it was still never brought out...So we ask to speak to a manager, who comes out like \"well it's busy, \u00a0the food is being brought out as it is being ready.\" Really? \u00a0We got half our meal at once, and not one thing was served hot. All room temp. So what were we waiting for, really? I find it hard to believe it took a blt just as long to be made as an omelet which takes the same amount of time as a burrito and they were all made simultaneously and came out at the exact same time. So she walks away without even letting us finish our complaints and goes to get some other guy, who knows who he is. He just walked up to us and says the same thing and they walk away. O....kay. lovely service that you can keep using that tired excuse, but not offer up any sort of apology or anything. Avoid this place like the plague. Avoid it like you'd avoid your nasty \u00a0stalker ex-something. Go across the street to Mello Yellow because, for a diner, they've always been solid in the service and food department.

And proceeded to ROUGHLY wash my hair.. then went on to burn me with their scoldly hot blow drier. After me acknowledging that he burnt me. He then, throws me out his chair, hair still soaked and takes the woman who had just walked in the shop. I was furious. I was told to wait in the front of the shop (where i sat for an HOUR) . Then, another guy starts blow drying my now-dry hair... and asks me how i want it. I show him a picture and he goes into a frantic, rude rant about how I couldnt get that style because of my short hair. I was only originally referring to the picture for an IDEA.. not exact style. He also threw me out his chair, I was in tears at this point. I was appalled. The next guy then tells me he'll take care of me so i waited for another 30mins.

Big Girl Salon that used to be across the street was such a treat, so I never ventured to Fairy Nails. However, since Big Girl lost their lease and closed, I decided to give Fairy Nails a try. From the instant you walk in you're overwhelmed by fumes and can instantly tell that the place isn't clean. If the floors and open area are dirty, then the pedicure bowls must be infested with who-knows what considering they barely rinse between clients. What I'm quite sure of is that Fairy Nails can take credit for the plantar's wart I got after getting a pedicure there several times.None of their tools are in disinfectant solution. So gross. I took a friend from out of town there in the Fall. We walked in, she looked around, said \"nope\" and walked out. Smart woman.I walked by recently and noticed they've done some remodeling. And by remodeling, I mean opening up, but not finishing a wall, and moving the pedicure chairs from one side of the salon to make room for more manicure stations. The seating situation is better for those waiting, but it still looks filthy.Today I read an extensive article in The New York Times about the horrible conditions under which nail technicians work. Men are always the salon owners and the mainly-immigrant woman who speak no English and have no resources or support system are often treated, literally, like indentured servants. Upon arrival in America, \u00a0they have to buy into the job, then they receive little-to-no pay and are forced to live in unacceptable and abysmal conditions, some times in the basement of the salon owner's home. If you can get a mani/pedi for about $20, then the employees are not being treated/compensated well or fairly. Unfortunately, the thousands of shops across the country like Fairy Nails are not closely regulated.The women who work at Fairy Nails deserve better, as do the women of Hyde Park.", "rating": "1"}, "13": {"date": [2015, 6, 23], "description": "Worst nail techs ever.

The prices are very reasonable.ATMOSPHERE: it's kind of a small operation. \u00a0There two rooms, the manicure room where you enter the shop and right next to it is a room for pedicures. \u00a0Not decorated, all the nail stations are packed together and it doesn't really look like they have storage-- all their supplies are stacked up on shelves in the pedicure room. There were five (exhausted) employees working when I was there.MY EXPERIENCE: I asked for an American manicure. \u00a0I don't get manicures regularly, maybe I've had 10 in my life. \u00a0This was my first time getting anything beyond a mani pedi with polish so I trusted the nail technician. \u00a0He sat me down and started to file my nails with an electric drill... all over the surface of my nails! \u00a0I figured that was just part of the process until he pulled out a big box of plastic finger nails!!! \u00a0I freaked out and explained that I did not want anything fake, I just wanted my own nails. \u00a0He then told me that my nails were too thin/short to do an American manicure on and pointed at the colored polishes saying that's all I could get. \u00a0I almost cried; I had a big even to go to that evening. \u00a0He had destroyed the surface of my nails. \u00a0There was definitely a language barrier or a hearing problem because he just nodded a lot even when I asked him clarifying questions (because I didn't trust him to just do his own thing after that). \u00a0I asked another guy about what could be done with my nails at this point-- he seemed to be in charge of the place and was having friendly, cheerful conversations with two women who appeared to be regular customers so I felt he might be a good \"second opinion\" and an additional person to avoid any lost-in-translation incidents. \u00a0The woman he was working on had beautiful nails almost finished and they looked very natural. \u00a0She said they were \"gels\" and that they were way more natural looking than acrylics (plastic nails). \u00a0Those were one of my only options to salvage my hacked up nails so I asked the two men if it was possible to have my nails look natural --they said yes and I ended up with a beautiful set of very natural-looking gels with an American finish. \u00a0But that cost me $35 plus tip instead of the $13 I thought I was going in to spend.THE GOOD:-Crowded and popular. So they're doing something right.-They were able to fix a problem they caused, though I did have to do a lot of self-advocating.-Their prices are clearly painted on the wall so you know what you're going to be charged.-I saw them clean EVERYTHING and all bowls, liquids, etc where brand new with each customer, as they should be.-They have an excellent selection of polish colors.-The TV was tuned to a local Chicago station and it made the time pass.-The do a DAMN GOOD set of gels!THE BAD:-The waiting area is immediately next to the front door. \u00a0So in January it was a big blast of icy cold air every time a customer opened it. \u00a0The door also didn't close on its own so someone had to get up and push it shut so there wouldn't be a draft.-Parking SUCKS. \u00a0There's only street parking and a pay lot. \u00a0I had to park 2 blocks away.-I, seriously, almost passed out at two points because of the fumes. \u00a0I don't believe they have a ventilation system at all. \u00a0I felt horrible for the employees. \u00a0They wore face masks but I think that only helped keep them from breathing in the dust from filing nails. \u00a0They all looked completely worn out.-My technician not only destroyed the surface of my nails and couldn't communicate with but also had hands so chapped that his skin was cracking to the point where it looked like it was bleeding (not currently bleeding --I would have stopped immediately). \u00a0He did not wear gloves to protect him or the customers.-This certainly wasn't necessary and I would have paid regardless of the outcome because they spent time on me, but no one even apologized let alone offered a discount for their mess-up.MY VERDICT: Fairy Nails isn't the least bit magical but it did have a happy ending. \u00a0The moral of the story: I didn't have a good experience but I wouldn't rule out it being a great nail place for those who get what they ask for but I'm not going back again.", "rating": "2"}, "4": {"date": [2015, 8, 26], "description": "I've been coming to this place for over 10 years now and they never disappoint.

So my boyfriend and I decided to go on Saturday morning to talk to the owner: perhaps we can exchange the pot? Send it back to the manufacturer? Get a new one with a minor discount? None of all this. No apologies and we were treated extremely rudely. We were told that apparently the pot could not be used on the stove-top (contrary to what I was told) and dismissed in a very brisk manner.

Fair Trade coffee for 1 smackaroo). \u00a0Fair Trade coffee is a darker roast with strong flavor, and it is an ethical brand of coffee that ensures that the farmers and growers of coffee beans are paid a fair wage for their labor. \u00a0Not that purchasing Regular coffee is unethical by any means - it is grown locally by a small group of farmers outside of Chicago. \u00a0Either choice supports the little guys rather than reinforcing the deeply-lined pockets of The Man.Espresso can also be purchased for one lowly dollar, and the Div School standard is that all shots come doubled at a strong and healthy 2 oz. \u00a0If you are lucky enough to come in MWF between 10:30-11:30, you will hit the jackpot Latte Hour and get a 12 oz. latte or cappuccino for (you guessed it) $1. \u00a0Any other time of the week, espresso drinks are roughly $2 - a far cry from the $4 you'd pay at Starbucks!Pastries are catered in locally from La Petit bakery every morning, but they usually sell out well before lunchtime. \u00a0The Div School was actually the first campus location to broker lunch catering deals with local restaurants, and as a result they have the lowest prices on boxed lunches from places like Siam, The Nile, Cedars, Soul Veg, Edwardo's, Good to Go Foods and more. \u00a0Most boxed lunches sell for $5.25, but you can find many other fares (slices of pizza, spinach pies, pasta salads) priced anywhere from $1.75 - $4.25. \u00a0Add a beverage from the generously stocked fridge, and you can have lunch for an average of $6. \u00a0Not too shabby.The cheap coffee and catered food is what attracts the majority of patrons around the lunch hour, but loyal patrons who frequent the shop in the early morning (the shop opens at 7:45 in order to serve you coffee before you have to be behind your desk at 8:00) come back for the friendly staff and quirky atmosphere. \u00a0To wit: recently, a \"Battle of the Gods\" was waged March-Madness-style on the giant chalkboard behind the counter, and patrons cast their tips to vote between the heavyweight religious, imaginary, and literary likes of Muhammad, Jesus, Poseidon, Foucault, John Lennon, and - this round's ultimate champion - Optimus Prime of Transformers fame. \u00a0The first battle lasted more than three months, spawned loyal followers, and grew into a local phenomenon for its kooky and irreverent treatment of typically weighty religious figures. \u00a0The Div School Coffee Shop is staffed by graduate students, managed by students, and run by students - and its independent financial status from the U of C means that all its profits are used to directly benefit the Divinity School and (of course) its students. \u00a0The laid-back atmosphere in the shop is a product of its student-run status - this is no Starbucks! \u00a0The lack of sophistication (there isn't even a cash register, so all tabs are calculated via quick mental math) will frustrate patrons who want their triple-shot low-fat mocha raspberry iced lattes within a minute of placing the order, but all other patrons will likely be charmed by the slow pace, intellectual banter, and friendly staff. \u00a0Order the same drink more than twice from the same worker, and chances are good they'll remember it for you on the third visit. \u00a0They'll probably know your name by the fifth visit, and the names of your children and pets and childhood imaginary friend by the tenth. \u00a0Like I said, this is no Starbucks!Keeping with the support-the-students atmosphere, adorning the walls are the works of talented U of C senior art students, providing a means for young artists to display their pieces and discerning patrons to potentially purchase original art for a fraction of the price. \u00a0If you don't want a painting, you can purchase a T-shirt or travel mug for $10 to commemorate your trip to God's Coffee House. \u00a0In short: \u00a0The Divinity School Coffee Shop is a quirky and off-beat find, run in an anti-Starbucks environment by students who believe in dispensing non-specific salvation - one fairly-traded cup of coffee at a time.***The power of God compels me to confess: this review may have been slightly influenced by the fact that I am, indeed, the senior student employee of aforementioned coffee shop. \u00a0You can direct any complaints to my manager, the Big Java Drinker in the Sky. \u00a0This is God's coffee house, so take up your issues with Her.", "rating": "5"}, "4": {"date": [2015, 3, 14], "description": "They are vegan-vegetarian friendly which is super nice.

Long story short, it took a couple of huddles between the cashier, the cook, and two other people before they decided to give me another piece of chicken. Then they accused me of eating a piece because my basket only had three pieces. I didn't realize that they had also shorted me a piece! \u00a0I told them I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO EAT A PIECE. \u00a0I walked from the check out window to the table, cheched my order, and walked back to the service window. I will go to a different Harolds! Don't sell me old chicken and then have a huddle with four different people to fix the problem.

Dinner is probably the best time of day to come, as I can't imagine anyone would be able to be productive after indulging in this finger-licking experience in Hedonism.Sauce: Most all of their food comes with sauce over it, so you will have to declare your allegiance (or specify your means of death).

At worst, it can be described as a necessary trial to prove your desperation--oh the wait, the agonizing, excruciating wait! At best, it's a mundane ten-or-so minutes (YMMV, depending on how large and how strange your order is) to endure. However, there is some comic relief in the game of telephone that inevitably occurs. To elaborate: the game begins when the servicepeople behind the bullet-proof glass yell out what to me appears to be a randomly-generated IID number. Then, the customers waiting in line will begrudgingly check their own receipts (to their dismay). It proceeds as they look around and see if anyone else was lucky enough to win the jackpot (incidentally, there is a small lotto shop attached to this Harolds, but I think it's a different enterprise on its own), and if not, someone will yell out a DIFFERENT number, perhaps out of spite, genuine concern but hard of hearing, or a part of the usual necessary bedlam in the process (nobody knows). Upon hearing their number finally being called out, someone will happily rush over, only to find that it was 108 and not 92, to everyone's dismay, and the game begins again.

Inside that door was the restaurant.

Each dish came with Fried rich with shrimp and an Egg Roll. My wife ordered Mongolian Beef and I ordered Orange Chicken. We were astonished on the portion! Each plate looked good enough for 2-3 persons! The main dish was delicious! The Mongolian Beef was soft , tasty, but slightly on the salty side, but not a deal breaker. The Orange Chicken was crisp with a \"just-right\" sweetness to it. The fried rice was a tad salty, I wish the chef used less Soy Sauce. It was totally noticeable by the color of the fried rice.

It just sounds like a teenager from the 90s playing his boombox too loud to annoy the neighbors. The selection is okay, but nothing you can't find anywhere else if you get your fingers dusty. And what happened to all the classical stuff? And how does the same record labeled with the same condition and the same pressing have 3 different prices when I find it in different spots in the store?

Last time I went there, I brought vinyls to sell, those were from my own collection and it was mostly classical, free jazz, and 20th-century avant-garde. Guy buying the records was all over the Schoenberg and John Cage albums, and visibly pleased that someone had brought this material in. My hope is just to get a token amount of money for certain albums, and to enjoy debating the merits and demerits of the music, i.e. : (a) Good music that we should recommend others to listen to, or(b) Really not good, or not to our tastes, but something that will nevertheless sell in Hyde Park, or (c) \u00a0\"Naaah... I wouldn't buy that, either.\"This time, I brought 20 CD's that were left behind by my neighbor, of what one would call \"indie rock\" and electronica. I cannot really agree with this person's musical tastes, and the criticism I would make is that his collection was very formulaic. On the other hand, there was nothing in really poor taste, and there were a few excellent albums among the more predictable stuff. First guy buying CD's said he doesn't know the material well enough to judge whether they should buy it, therefore wait for his \"boss\" to come look at them. Boss-man, who resembles a record-store employee, arrives shortly, looks at about three albums on the top of the stacks of CDs, and says \"Nothing we need here...\"In a manner which could be interpreted either as desultory or as \"hipper-than-thou\". He didn't even look at the other seventeen of the 20 CDs, so how would he know whether they need them or not? Come on, dude, at least go through the motions of playing the record-trading game . . . I brought you these for the fun of trading, not for the money.So I \"gifted\" them all of the 20 CDs, by walking out before they could attempt to give them back to me. I hope that they will come to their senses, and put a few of the better albums for sale in the racks. That having been said, they are a lot more polite than employees at a typical record store.

I bake mine and patron other Jamaican bakeries and was sad to have paid $4 plus tax and tip for a microwaved dish. The outer texture of the dough and the sunken center were the immediate clues to a microwaved dish.Entr\u00e9e: I ordered the large jerk chicken dish, because why only get two pieces for $12 when you get an half chicken meal for $14? I really liked their cabbage, but everything else was ok. The peas and rice were dry so I used jerk sauce on them and the three small plantains were also dry. The plantains are more of a garnish then an actual included side. The chicken was actually very tender, but lacked the flavor I was expecting so I just dumped more jerk sauce on it.Dessert: I ordered the apple caramel bread pudding. It was the best thing they had out of everything I ordered! It is a big portion and the caramel sauce is just sweet enough and not too thick. Well done.Staff: The hostess was nice, but clearly overwhelmed trying to manage her station and assist the servers. My waitress was kind, but may have been only one or two servers on duty on a busy weekend afternoon. From what I've read, this seems to be a consistent issue when dining here. Needless to say service was slow, but they tried to be attentive.Environment: The layout of the tables and hostess/host stand is awkward. I was seated by the door, which meant people had to come through my table to get out, while I was eating. The decor is nice and vibrant and the ambiance elevates their overall rating. I just think they need to re-structure the table layout and host stand. Overall, I would revisit knowing the food to be of C+ or B- quality. The ambiance and location is an A.

That was the first Jamaican restaurant I featured on my food blog. Well, the Lincoln Park location closed and the restaurant has moved to Hyde Park during the Hyde Park revitalization.Being the son of a Jamican father, I am a bit more in tune with authenticity. The Ja' Grill location in Lincoln Park had a bit more authenticity to it. The Hyde Park location seems to be holding back a bit, and part of that may be to pander to the local palates.The curry chicken was tender, but very mild in flavour. The rice and beans didn't have the hint of coconut milk in it that I was accustomed to tasting when eating my grandmother's cooking. I must admit that the coco bread mentally transported me back to Negril. Also, the curry soup was a plus for the cold weather we'd experienced in Chicago.I give high marks on the service. Having gone early in the afternoon, I was there before the dinner crowd. The Hyde Park location is more spacious, and I imagine it packs out nicely in the evenings.

For a match up between Uncle Joe's and Ja' Grill, scroll to the bottom. Appetizer: My patty took awhile to get and then appeared to be microwaved! I know the difference. I bake mine and patron other Jamaican bakeries and was sad to have paid $4 plus tax and tip for a microwaved dish. The outer texture of the dough and the sunken center were the immediate clues to a microwaved dish.Entr\u00e9e: I ordered the large jerk chicken dish, because why only get two pieces for $12 when you get an half chicken meal for $14? I really liked their cabbage, but everything else was ok. The peas and rice were dry so I used jerk sauce on them and the three small plantains were also dry. The plantains are more of a garnish then an actual included side. The chicken was actually very tender, but lacked the flavor I was expecting so I just dumped more jerk sauce on it.Dessert: I ordered the apple caramel bread pudding. It was the best thing they had out of everything I ordered! It is a big portion and the caramel sauce is just sweet enough and not too thick. Well done.Staff: The hostess was nice, but clearly overwhelmed trying to manage her station and assist the servers. My waitress was kind, but may have been only one or two servers on duty on a busy weekend afternoon. From what I've read, this seems to be a consistent issue when dining here. Needless to say service was slow, but they tried to be attentive.Environment: The layout of the tables and hostess/host stand is awkward. I was seated by the door, which meant people had to come through my table to get out, while I was eating. The decor is nice and vibrant and the ambiance elevates their overall rating.

Today, that food truck was Jack's Fork in the Road. My visit to this Food Truck was unfortunately plagued with one of the following issues:1. I chose the worst possible item on the menu, or2. This food truck benefits from peoples perception that 'if there's a line, it must be good'.Let me elaborate:When I got to Jack's food truck, I asked the cashier if she had a preference of the turkey or veggie sandwich, and she proceeded to read me the description plastered on the side of the truck. I decided to go with the veggie because I was in the mood for some vegetables and the sandwich looked good. After 15 minutes I was ready to chow down. I found a seat outside to enjoy the weather and my delicious sandwich, then I realized... I made a horrible mistake.My sandwich was exactly what the description said it was plus an extra cup of liquid. This made it nearly impossible to eat without the expectation of a shower and change of clothes after I finished. I really don't think it's too unfair to expect items from a food truck to be reasonably easy to eat in an outdoor setting. My second point refers to peoples tendency to wait in lines just because lines exist, without ever knowing what the line is for or if the line is even worth waiting in. I believe that Jack's has a line simply because they're really slow. I waited 15 minutes for my sandwich, and my order was the only one being prepared. I've seen this truck during the lunch rush, and the line is at least 20 people deep. I'm guessing that half of those people don't even know what's on the menu. Poor suckers.Since I really love food trucks, and I tend to have a history of ordering the wrong thing, I will definitely give Jack's another chance.

LaSalle, and also S. Wacker. While some other food trucks parked nearby are super busy, Jack's is generally not, and I think there's a reason for that. I've had their best-selling (according to them) Roast Pork Loin sandwich, and a turkey with cranberry sauce on special.The roast pork loin sandwich is tasty, but served with an apple slaw that in transport, soaked through the sandwich and was a mess. The turkey with cranberry sauce on special was tasty, so they're mostly winning in the sandwich arena.Where Jack's does not exceed is wait time and being unorganized, (check out the Duchess' review, I mean, she downgraded to 1-star, the Duchess!). On my second visit, people that ordered after me were getting their orders before me. I waited probably 10-15 minutes at lunch time from time of ordering to time of leaving with my food.

Yeah, I was wrong. It's gotten worse. Make no mistake, these guys put out good food. I'm just fed up with their lack of organization and reliability.I visit Jack's Fork in the Road at least once or twice a week. On at least four of my visits in the last month or so, they've been parked at their scheduled stop with their window shut despite tweets saying that they would be open by that time. The clock hits 11:30, 11:40, ... and they still don't open - and since all of the employees are inside the truck, there's no one there to explain the delay or give an estimated time that they will be open.I understand that sometimes things come up and cause them to be running late, but the frequency with which they're behind schedule is frankly unacceptable. People don't have 20 minutes to stand around waiting for a food truck that may not even open during the time frame that they have for lunch. I personally have about 15 minutes to run downstairs, grab food, and come back. What's more, they don't inform people on Twitter when they are opening late - their original tweet stating that they will be open at 10:30, 11, etc stays up, and there's no notification that they're not yet actually open.I don't know. Honestly, I do like their food a lot, but I feel obligated to share that they're pretty disorganized most of the time - it's not a good idea to plan your lunch break around them unless you have 20 or 30 minutes to hang around.What else to add? Today, I was the third person in line. At least five people and ten sandwiches were served to people who ordered after me. All told, it was 45-50 minutes between me arriving at the truck and walking away with my food. Oh yeah, and I saw one guy in the truck lick his fingers and then go back to putting food together.I take back what I said before - don't go here.

My baby son has been straight ripping the hair out of my head by the root for the past year, leaving my hair a cracky looking mixture of frizzly lengths and my nerves shot to hell. So I just went and got a new haircut. But if I had TWO little babies doing that to me at the same time, who knows what I would have done... Getting my hair cut by Dezel was a trip - he was literally dancing around me in the chair, regaling me with stories about his life.

I didn't really have a style or cut in mind, so I just told him to fix my shit - and he did. I was disappointed that he only spray bottle wet me down instead of a proper shampoo, but I just figured that's how he does it, so whatever. After the cut he gave me a blow out that made me look so Jackie/Chelle-rific that I wanted to throw my hat up in the sky toward all of those Obama banners all over Hyde Park. $25 and they let me walk in with no appointment. I'd come back for a style or blow out, but the cut itself is pretty average.Although I did not get the massage that outdoes people literally jumping on your back and shit (clearly a mistake on my part), I didn't really find this spot very Zen, other than leaving with a pretty slamming new do.

The manicure/pedicure lady is super nice and I would give her five stars! I wanted to like this place BUT the attitude of the person who did the thread/waxing was just too much. Long story below:I went in and got a mani pedi and eyebrow and upper lip thread. Two different people do them. The manicure/pedicure lady was great- she even thought of my color while I was waiting and that was exactly what I had wanted! While the technique of the threader/waxer was good, the way she treated me was definitely brusque and unequal to others. I waited a long time and spent about 2.5 hours there, so about 10 other customers walked in during the time I was there. To everyone who came in EXCEPT FOR ME- she would say Hello dear or honey-they were definitely an older clientele (e.g. 30s+) and mostly African American. To provide a comparison I am an Asian in my 20s- I am new to Chicago, and to her place so she has probably never seen me before. \u00a0It doesn't me that I should be treated differently when I am paying the same price and tipping fairly! I kept on wondering what I did wrong to have her treat me this way.. For example, I was waiting for the mani/pedi to finish and she could have done my eyebrows before- not because of time constraints but so I could hold the eyelid taut - but she took several other customers after me instead. She then chose to do threading after my manicure, so I couldn't touch anything- it hurt horribly that way and I was in tears. She just told me I needed to stay still. I tipped 25% for mani/pedi - I feel that is above the standard 15% that Tipping for Dummies recommends. I still gave 13.33% to the threader. However, she forgot to charge the tip on my card. However, she didn't realize this until 10 minutes later- I had already put on my socks and shoes, etc and was on the street a block away. Suddenly, I hear someone yelling behind me- she flippantly waved her hand like I didn't pay or something. Excuse me, it is your problem that you did not charge me the correct amount when I had verbally specified how much I was tipping.

The store smelled like fresh chocolate, and they had some candy samples out, which were pretty tasty.But since it was a hot day, I was in the mood for ice cream.My friends and I spent a long time trying to figure out the flavor of ice cream that we wanted. But the staff was very patient with us and happily made recommendations and gave us samples. When i saw the Superman flavor, I instantly felt so nostalgic for my childhood favorite flavor. Right now, I generally like flavors like peanut butter, pistachio, or strawberry, and certainly nothing too \"colorful.\" But I made an exception that day. And to take reliving my childhood all the way, I got a milkshake. That's right, a Superman milkshake. It turned a really bright, unnatural shade of blue, but I had no shame that day. It was delicious!But besides the fact that it is a lot of sugar to have at once, and it is a flavor I don't normally choose, this is a treat that I will only have once in a while because it was very expensive.

When asked if I needed help, I specifically asked the young lady for salted caramel ice cream - hand-packed. The term hand-packed must have thrown her for a loop and she eventually understood and went to the carton to get the quart packed for me. So popular is the item that the container was empty and hadn't been replaced. She was a bit confused on where to look for another container and requested help from another employee. Eventually they pulled out a container from the back freezer as I was getting anxious. So after a while the young lady who was hardly interested in working this evening finished packing up my quart, asked if I wanted a bag (yes) and lamely said have a nice evening. Now I'm okay all the young folks \"tude\" if the service is up to snuff. But when I got home to serve myself and spouse a dish, I noticed the ice cream was not even remotely packed. It was loosely dropped into the container and after serving a small dish there was less than half of the quart remaining!

Right now, I generally like flavors like peanut butter, pistachio, or strawberry, and certainly nothing too \"colorful.\" But I made an exception that day. And to take reliving my childhood all the way, I got a milkshake. That's right, a Superman milkshake. It turned a really bright, unnatural shade of blue, but I had no shame that day. It was delicious!But besides the fact that it is a lot of sugar to have at once, and it is a flavor I don't normally choose, this is a treat that I will only have once in a while because it was very expensive.

The food is just okay. Flavors tend to be bland and underwhelming. I usually get a burrito suizo which is just a burrito topped with melted cheese. Pretty standard fillings but they tend not be all that satisfying. The price is also pretty expensive for what you get. The burritos are about 8 bucks and a dollar more for extra cheese. I'm a big fan of chile relleno but you only get about 2 small stuffed peppers and half a scoop of beans and rice along with it. Again, not worth the price and it's just okay in terms of flavor. The most flavorful dish I've had there was beef tongue in a chili verde sauce, though unfortunately the only thing i could taste was overwhelming spice.Service wise, it can be pretty slow. Some of the waiters take forever to take your order and are very curt. Sometimes I felt like I've straight up been ignored. They do bring you free chips and salsa though this is the stingiest place I've seen when it comes to handing them out. There are often literally no more than 10 chips per basket and they are in no hurry to refill it when empty.They do have a bar and a large selection of margaritas but I don't think it's worth coming here for those either.

It is not set up like a typical Mexican restaurant menu with categories (burrito, fajita, tacos, etc.) and meat choices (beef, chicken, pork, veggie, etc.), plus some special combinations/dinner plates. Maravillas' menu is mostly dinner plates with VERY limited vegetarian options. Their \"vegetarian dish\" is mostly rice and beans with some dinky tomato and avocado garnish. I don't eat meat and when I go out I want some yummy vegetables, not just rice and beans. They do have various cheesy options (like quesadillas and enchiladas), but that still doesn't give me my veggie fix. I know Mexican food isn't always the healthiest, but I at least want some vegetables along with my grease and carbs.However, recently I went there for dinner and decided to ask if they could make the fajita dinner without meat. I generally dislike special ordering, but surprise--it was absolutely no problem for them!! And it was DELICIOUS, with a large portion of tomatoes, peppers, and onions. Yum!

Not everyone who works there, mind you. There are one or two who seem to have some sense, and there is one girl who is cute as hell. But I digress. Let me share an experience or two with you, oh weary traveler.1. I ordered a Quarter-Pounder with only cheese. The girl said, \"You just want cheese on that?\" Yes, quoth I. \"Do you want ketchup?\" Um, just cheese, thanks. \"No onions?\" Only cheese.Success! I only got cheese on my quarter-pounder! \u00a0Oh, but no meat. That's right. Cheese on a bun. I took it back inside and pointed it out. \"But you said with only cheese.\" So I did, fair lady. So I did.2. I asked for my Diet Coke in a sweet tea cup. Keeps it colder longer, dontcha know. \"You want a sweet tea?\" No, I want a diet coke. \"We don't mix drinks.\" What? \"You want sweet tea mixed with diet coke?\" No, I want only diet coke, but i want it in a sweet tea cup. \"Oh, Ok. $2.19.\" But Diet coke is only a dollar... \"RIght, but you want a sweet tea also, right?\" Nope, heh heh, just the one drink. DIet Coke. But I'd like for the styrofoam cup, normally associated with your sweet tea, to be the container used for said diet coke. You see, the styrofoam cup, although destroying our environment, keeps my diet coke colder longer, and keeps the ice from melting. I'm a selfish bastard, I know, but that's how I'd like my frosty beverage today. \"We use the plastic cups for drinks. You want a sweet tea?\"3. IN what should have been a scene from a movie, after sitting at the drive through window for close to 15 minutes waiting for someone to bring me my Sprite and small fries, the window opened and out came a cloud of sweet smelling smoke, and the guy said, \"Wait, wait wait wait wait hold up. What did you order, man?\" A large sprite and a small fry. \"Oh, man, yeah. Our ice-cream machine is down.\" Ok, I'll just have a sprite and small fries then. \"Cool, here you go.\" (Hands me a bag containing several big macs and a filet-o-fish.)4.

Hadn't had it in several years, but when I did, it was so memorable and amazing that I thought it would be a good choice. Called and placed the order. Simple medium sausage pizza. She said it would be about an hour, hour and a half. Surely about an hour later, a cold, soggy pizza with crumbled up sausage on it came through the door. It was absolutely disgusting. And did I mention cold? So, I called the store and explained what I just explained to the lady who answered. She placed me on hold to get the manager. A female voice answered and said \"hello?\" So I explained the story again. She placed me on hold. At this time, I'm very slightly agitated because I've waited an hour for this pizza and I'm hungry. So, asked y coworker \"Why do I have to keep being placed on hold for a manager?\" to which the manager (who was now on the phone) answered, \"Because they had to come find me, that's why.\" Um... Okay. So, I explained and she responded by telling me that I order sausage pizzas all the time and I've never complained and how they haven't done anything out of the ordinary to this one so why am I complaining now. I'm like, \"Um, no... I haven't had pizza from here in years...\" To which she responds (as if I'm lying), that the system keeps a log of my orders and that I clearly order from there all the time. So, after explaining that I was calling from work and that I work in a very large building and OTHER coworkers and others in the building might order from there frequently, I don't and that their orders have nothing to do with me. When I told her the pizza was cold, she told me that the pizza comes out of the oven and into an insulated bag right away for delivery, so there's no way the pizza is cold.

The outdoor seating for us was perfect because Ashland could also eat with us. It was easy to order at the coffeehouse counter and we were able to snag some ice water while we waited. I knew this place was known for its pizza but we wanted to keep our late lunch light and so opted for the salmon burger and the garbage burger. The take out containers were really cute and seemed also ideal for going to the beach or anywhere else on the run. Let's start with the garbage burger. It looked great! It was somewhat warm and medium as I asked. I was not impressed with the potato bun and recommend that you ask for any other bun besides that one. It was dry and was crumbling as I was eating which was a little annoying. There were a generous amount of toppings for a ten dollar burger. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce which was much sweeter than what I normally like. The slaw was really good though and the portion was just right. The salmon burger was also underwhelming for my partner. It was a generous size but also dry. The sauce on it didn't help very much and it still tastes pretty bland. The fries were good on the side. If we were to come back we'd try the pizza and stay away from the burgers. We peeked at sandwiches and those portions were large too.

Surely you are not about to tell us there was a problem with GRILLED CHEESE? Yes, my fellow yelpers, I'm afraid I am. It turns out you CAN mess up grilled cheese. Here's how: Take a slice of american cheese, and place it between 2 slices of white bread. Then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. That's right. The microwave. Then run it through a toaster so that it is burnt black on one side, and completely untouched on the other side. Throw on a pickle (for an extra 50 cents or so, depending on the day) and there you have it: the most disgusting grilled-- I'm sorry, not grilled-- microwaved and 1/2 toasted cheese sandwich ever.This alone would not cause me to jump on Yelp. I've had worse. But when I went in tonight and asked the guy cooking if he was going to grill my grilled cheese, suddenly this other idiot (who I'm told is the owner's son) runs over and says, \"He toasted it last time, that's good enough\". I politely told him no, it's not. When you order GRILLED cheese, what you secretly want is GRILLED cheese. He kept yelling about how pickles cost extra, they are only free with sandwiches. So, first of all, what does that have to do with anything? I don't know. And secondly, so is the grilled cheese sandwich NOT A SANDWICH?

I showed Mr. Lucchesi the shoe and after a brief conversation, it seemed he tried to minimize my shoe dilemma by telling me how much I worked in them (I've had them for seven months), and \"this is an $80 shoe anyway\" (so I was overcharged). When I told him he charged me $124, he remarked, \"well that's \u00a0beside the point\", when HE initially brought up price. He offered to give me $20 off a new pair and to order them for me because they were out of stock.

We weren't rushed, so we ordered appetizers of hummus (smooth but bland), lentil soup (also well-executed but the flavor wasn't very deep), spinach pie (excellent flavors and textures, not phyllo dough based, with a bit of kick to the spinach-onion filling), and Jerusalem salad (way overdressed, almost soupy, difficult to like). To follow, we had maklouba (\"upside down\" rice casserole) with chicken, which would have been excellent if the vegetables hadn't been overcooked to mush, and shish barrak, a large bowl with a few doughy dumplings swimming in a yogurt broth thickened substantially by flour and dotted with small chunks of what I think was lamb from a shank. The shish barrak, which I assume is comfort food in someone's home, was very hearty, but forgettably bland, or perhaps just an acquired taste. The maklouba, on the other hand, had the makings of greatness, and as it seems to be offered as a veggie-only dish or with different meats, would be worth trying again. The rest of the menu looks pretty standard Levantine (baba ganoush, falafel, kifta, kebabs, etc.), and given the comments here is likely worth exploring (although I am spoiled for life by the chicken shawarma at Naf Naf and I don't expect Nile to meet that standard). No alcohol served, but you can BYO or walk a few doors east to Jimmy's and pick up a 6-pack.", "rating": "3"}, "48": {"date": [2014, 9, 19], "description": "This review is solely based on our recent takeout experience that was inspired by our first dine-in visit where we learned the ins-and-outs on what The Nile does well (see my previous review for a quick heads-up on what wasn't quite right).That said, it was GREAT! For $13, you can order 12 of their fantastic falafel and a large mouth-watering hummus w/pita (ask for extra, the hummus is huge), and it was this revelation that moved us to add them to our ordering-in menu pile. The food was ready for pick-up in less than 15 minutes and was nicely packed with plenty of napkins, silverware, and the perfect amount of little individual falafel dipping sauces. The only letdown at all is that I sang immaculate praises over how perfectly warm, steamy, and soft the pita was in the restaurant only to find that our takeout order featured pita that hadn't been warmed up at all. Not a huge deal at all but being so close to a homerun, I wished they hadn't cut that corner. No big. Surprisingly, we (the hungry two of us) could only eat half of both the falafel and the hummus, so technically, we could have cruised by with a small hummus and 6-piece falafel for $7...that would be one happy highway robbery, and one I imagine we'll be repeat offenders for.Thanks, The Nile, for a wonderful night in!", "rating": "4"}, "49": {"date": [2014, 8, 18], "description": "This place is pretty delicious.

Simple yet filling and tasty - the chicken shwarma sandwich ($6) is also a great value.I've also tried the maklouba, which sounded different, not something you can find at your typical fast-casual Naf Naf/Roti/etc. in the Loop.

The yogurt paired really well with the eggplant and carrots, but the whole thing was pretty mushy and really needed some texture.The hummus is standard, nice and creamy but bland. The babaganouj is just slightly smoky and pretty good, and the stuffed grape leaves are small but pack a lot of flavor and a nice hint of lemon.

I only came because it was convenient for my schedule the day I needed my hair done (my stylist is in the burbs). I am natural (10+ years) and went from having my hair blown out once a week to once or twice a year. I've worked hard to grow out the heat damage over the last few years and, of course, was nervous going to a new place. It started off fine. The assistant washed (rather rough in my opinion) and conditioned (if you do not get a deep condition, they apply product, comb it through and wash it out-no steamer) my hair. Then its gets bad. While my hair is natural (4b) it is soft and fine. The assistant added a heat protectant, which I appreciated and proceeded to blow dry. He was extremely too rough. I could feel the hairs breaking as he pulled the brush through. I offered to help detangle but was ignored. He would dry one part, dry a second part and add them together and go over it again. Once I realized he intended to do this for each part he dried, meaning that he was continuously adding heat to already straightened hair, I asked him to stop going over the same sections repeatedly. This time I was not ignored but given a snide remark about getting my hair straight. Again, I am not new to natural blowouts and have been getting them for years. My regular stylist can get my hair bone straight with one or two passes, so my hair hardly needs excessive heat. When he finally finished, he proceeded to do a final pass; but,frustrated, I got up and said \"it's straight.\" The stylist appeared to be nice and although she also used too much heat, I liked my hair. So all is OK (I had already decided not to return but it wasnt yelp worthy) until checkout. I was charged $55. My mother only pays $45 which is what I assumed I would pay. When I inquired about the $10 difference, I was told that I had virgin hair. Ummm, excuse me but my mom has been natural for at least 8 years!! They had no answer for that. Maybe if they would've said length, I would've understood as my hair is longer than my mom's. Most of the other salons that have natural clients charge the same price for everyone unless your hair is really long. Imagine my surprise when told I was being charged more than my natural mom in a salon that does natural hair. Silly me!! I will also point out that the client before me made a fuss about being charged $65, stating \"I always pay $55, so why is it more this time?\" There is too much competition in the immediate area for this type of behavior. The pontential heat damage, excessive manipulation, and inconsistent pricing is not worth a style that can be done at half a dozen shops in walking distance. For heat conscious naturals, I would caution you to steer clear. For those with perms or who blow dry often and enjoy pricing games, the stylist is decent. *fingers crossed that my curls return!!", "rating": "1"}, "9": {"date": [2015, 6, 17], "description": "My 1st time here and I had a very good experience.

The most grievous problem I have with this dumpling restaurant is that it's not a dumpling restaurant. \u00a0It's an otherwise perfectly lovely restaurant that tries to fit its food inside (and around) dumplings. \u00a0I think there's a profound lack of respect and understanding of dumplings as a food item that really limits this place. \u00a0The entire thing is treated as a novelty, as some gimmick for packaging otherwise nice food. \u00a0I realize this sounds like some minor crazy philosophical point, but it matters.1. The fillings were almost all meat. \u00a0This is a mistake. \u00a0Single-filling dumplings are necessarily lacking in their range of flavors-they will feel less filling and satisfying because of it. \u00a0Especially when we're talking two-or-four dumpling portions, this is a huge setback.2. Many of the meats appeared to be precooked, which is an understandable decision: they get to use more interesting meats than would be otherwise possible. \u00a0Moreover, dumplings (hypothetically) allow the delivery of flavors and meats that would otherwise take much longer to cook. \u00a0But when handled badly, the meat ends up being dry and mushy (especially as it has to be chopped down into a filling, losing a lot of structural integrity and mouthfeel). \u00a0It was handled badly.3. Packed's way around this is to use sauces and garnishes and etc. \u00a0First off, isn't this a little backwards? \u00a0To make dumplings better by putting things on top of and around them, rather than inside them? \u00a0Secondly, this makes the entire dumpling project seem more laborious and extraneous. \u00a0If I'm cutting apart a duck dumpling so I can smear it ginger-scallion sauce and pick up scallions, why am I not just eating duck breast in ginger scallion sauce? \u00a0Why am I eating a dumpling instead? \u00a0Thirdly, there's often not enough of these extras/enough strength of flavor to really balance out the uniformity of the meat dumplings. \u00a0My point is not that these extra touches are totally wrong-the plating was often attractive, the sauces were well-made, I enjoyed them-but that they can't save a poorly conceived dumpling. \u00a04. Some of the ideas were just poorly conceived. \u00a0The lobster dumplings were modeled after classic ways of eating lobster, with minimal accompaniment, but the texture and flavor of lobster doesn't keep well enough for that. \u00a0The rice dessert dumpling had a lot of great flavors assembled around it, but the dumpling itself was filled with congealed rice pudding-it very much felt like eating a bread sandwich. \u00a0Silliness.5. The wrapper was honestly not very good, and I don't know if that's because of how long they'd been stored or what. They were a little thick, which is not a bad thing. \u00a0I love thick-skinned dumplings. \u00a0But they were dry, a little flabby (presumably precooked to some degree), and largely tasteless. \u00a0Even the duck dumpling's fancy curry wrapper didn't have nearly enough flavor to add.6. The service was lovely and the food came out lightning fast. \u00a0But food that comes out so fast really makes me question: how long ago was it actually made? \u00a0To what degree was it already precooked? \u00a0I would've been happy to wait five more minutes if it meant that my dumplings would actually be cooked, and taste a little less like they were reheated in a microwave.7. I understand that I might've caught the restaurant on an off day, or perhaps an off hour. \u00a0I imagine all these dumplings would taste much better freshly made (though there would still be some basic issues). \u00a0But we ate there at 6 pm on a Wednesday. \u00a0I know that isn't the most important day of the week for any restaurant, but if you can't expect good food at exactly dinner time, when the hell can you expect it?There were a lot of interesting flavor combinations that I was excited and subsequently disappointed by. My overall impression is that dumplings are being treated as a way to deliver some semblance of fine dining to customers, rather than fine dining being used to elevate dumplings. \u00a0Which is fine, I suppose, but mediocre dumplings are mediocre dumplings even if they're made with locally-sourced ingredients and fancy short ribs; the price just makes it bite even more.It's not all bad news, to be sure. \u00a0I really enjoyed the pozole soup dumpling I had, made with braised shoulder of lamb, peppers, and hominy. \u00a0I was a little skeptical, but it won me over-it was almost like an explosion of a really layered, delicious chili in my mouth. \u00a0(I had some trivial complaints about it, but w/e) \u00a0But I'll note that it succeeds primarily because it goes in the opposite direction of a lot of Packed's dumpling offerings: it packs all the flavors inside the dumpling.I'm running out of space. \u00a0I want this place to succeed so badly! \u00a0Packed does a lot of things right! \u00a0Atmosphere, decor, service, exciting menu changes, seasonality, local relationships, etc. \u00a0It just doesn't do dumplings right, and that's the tragedy.", "rating": "2"}, "10": {"date": [2016, 2, 18], "description": "I LOVE this place.

I want to start off with this: I am all about paying a little extra for food that's worth it. This food is not worth it. Not even close.If you need to put signage at the register to justify why your menu is so expensive, I think you need to reevaluate your strategy - maybe focus on making the food instead of telling us about it. Hyde Park is a neighborhood with super limited restaurant options - I can't imagine that so many people would complain about the price if the quality was up to par. No one should support a big up-charge for locally sourced and organic ingredients if you are going to prepare them so horribly wrong that they become inedible. Let's break it down: I paid over $15 for a 6 pack. A 6 pack = 6 items, 4 dumplings (2 flavors), a side, and a drink. (It's worth noting that most of the dumplings cost an extra $1 to be included in this lunchtime deal.) I grabbed the pastrami and lobster dumplings, with a side of crackers (black bean dip / chicken liver mousse), and a Nicaraguan Cascara (1 of 2 drinks currently on the menu).The pastrami dumplings were OK. The lobster dumplings were so difficult to bite through that the texture made me gag - they were like sinewy rocks. The combination of flavors tasted like sea regrets and an old vanilla candle. I couldn't ingest any of it. Just...nope.The chicken liver mousse was so foul I couldn't get it down, either. I have no idea what happened inside of my mouth.The Nicaraguan Cascara was too strong. I've had this drink before and enjoyed it - but this was a bitter mess that needed some water to dilute the strength and open up some actual flavor.I don't understand the concept of this restaurant's ever changing menu if nothing on the menu is ever executed to perfection.

Buying local, organic, non-GMO ingredients is too expensive for anyone to eat often without a 6-figure salary. Presumably this has something to do with government subsidies and farming.If you are poor, it's probably impossible to eat in a way that is 'environmentally friendly' - and it's not your fault - it's just the system that is broken. Thus I don't think Chef Sheerin is to blame for the high prices nor his philosophy of how he acquires ingredients. There seems to be a lot of hate on that, though I will admit it's a bit odd for 4 out of the 5 main dumpling types to be premium-priced vs the other one.Is Hyde Park - a mostly student-filled, and middle class neighborhood - the wrong neighborhood to open a high-end fast casual place? Maybe. But I think if this restaurant had opened elsewhere it wouldn't bring up the same issues on how sustainable farming and class intersect.Now onto the food... yes, it's expensive. I'm very small and my lunch special was just on the cusp of being filling. My meal was around $14 and that was with not buying any of the special dumplings. I don't imagine I would go here for anything other than special occasions. I definitely think - and this might be how the place was marketed - this place is trying to make 'dining as entertainment' available to a wider audience. I'm still not really sold on 'dining as entertainment' (think Alinea, etc), but if you are curious this seems like a good start for relatively cheap. The flavors sure are uh interesting.I could see the $2-$2.50/dumpling price tag making sense, but the pricing on the salad seemed offensive - unless those are some really rare peppers being used. Maybe it's the watercress, I have no idea. The salad was really small and by itself, $7. But, it was good.We sort of avoided anything people had complained about and the food we had was great. The drinks are bitter, but this goes well with all the dumplings, which are not bitter. The menu changes often, at time of writing we had the coffee and the hibiscus black tea. The coffee's actually really good for being black, I'd recommend it, it's got just enough flavor tones to be palatable and not overly bitter. The tea, not as much. The beginning of the flavor is good - slightly sweet hibiscus and then slightly bitter, but the end of it has too much bitter bite. It didn't seem possible to cut this by adding some milk or cane syrup.The food we got was:- Lamb dumplings - these were nice- Mango rice dumplings - I think the rice filling could use some flavor that comes out near the end. The toppings were nice, but fade out and by the end it tastes like (better than average) rice pudding/sticky rice- Banana dumplings - really good, not overly sweet, but the sesame paste can overpower everything.- Pastrami dumplings -nice balance all around! the pickled tomatoes and spicy sauce thing on the bottom work well- hush puppies - these went really well with the coconut sour cream! \u00a0felt expensive for $7 by itself since you just get 3- salad -mentioned above - good flavor, great salad, just really expensiveI'd be interested if there would be a way to compromise Sheerin's morals and great flavors with a cheaper menu. Especially for people who need more than a small meal.I imagine that something that would help this restaurant could be building more trust with the local community.

Garnished with some olive oil and pecorino cheese, and served with house-made marinara. Marinara sauce was amazing. I'm not sure how you were supposed to eat this-- dunking the dumpling in the marinara was quite cumbersome. I took a bite of the dumpling, then scooped up a bit of the marinara and put it directly in my mouth. When the dumplings were gone i still had a ton of marinara, which also went directly into my mouth because it was amazing. It's in that right zone of spiciness where you can tell it's spicy but it's not burning your mouth. 9/10 needed instructions, opted for shovel, definitely get this.Shrt Rib- probably my least favorite of the three. Kinda bland, maybe the actual meat couldn't stand up to how plain the brown rice was? Came with a horseradish sauce that was decent. 4/10 would order something elseMac 'n' cheese- let me tell you about this mac. A delightfully thick american cheese sauce covers house made udon noodles. But so what right? WELL. They also add nori and shiitake mushrooms. The nori might sound weird but it adds a saltiness to the dish that really makes it stand out. The shiitake mushrooms give you something hearty to chew. The menu says there's jalapeno in this but im 99% sure i did not get any jalapeno. 9/10 so wonderful, and compared to the dumplings it's a really good portion.The sweet potato side looked really good as well, will probably order it the next time I go there. There is also a crackers side that consists of different types of crackers with a black bean dip and a liver mousse. Looked good. Didn't get any dessert, but their banana dessert sounds super great. The pear sounds good too except it has whipped coconut and I Hate Coconut.I didnt order any of the specialty drinks because I'm lame and only drink water. However, their Nitrogen-charged Winter Coffee sounds amazing and I heard good things about the Winter Lemonade. The nicaraguan cascara \"tea\" is apparently too summery of a drink according to some people considering it is currently Not Summer.Final verdict: Small portion sizes for their main $4/2 attraction might be a turn off considering you will probably order more than one. However, the bold flavors of (most of) the dumplings are a great change of pace from the bold burntness of Bartlett chicken breasts. The lunch option seems to be a great deal!

The sides impressed me as both creative and delicious. However, in totality, Packed delivered a less than filling dining experience.

One cheese, one spinach, and one chorizo. All very good. My favorite was the Chorizo one.I had the cheese and spinach ravioli with a vodka cream sauce and chicken breast. The ravioli just melted on my tongue and the flavors were so delicate. It was soo good. It felt velvety and the ravioli wasnt super dry which was a delight. The Chicken breast complimented that perfectly. My friend had a salad and she was pleased to know that everything tasted fresh and the mozzerella was amazing. Wanna know something crazy yelp readers? I was enjoying my food so much I don't even remember what my 3rd friend had. Oh well. I am almost positive it was good because wen didnt even handle any business on our \"business\" lunch.

The service overall was good, but lets dive into the food! I ate a lot. For starters there was the fried calamari and the Tex-Mex Egg Roll which were okay. The Mixed Baby Green Salad was good with vinaigrette was delicious. It normally comes with raspberry vinaigrette but that was a little thick and not preferred. The main courses that I personally tried was the Pasta Shells with Salmon which were season well and had mushrooms, which is personal dislike of mine, but it was still good nevertheless.The Tequila Lime Chicken fettuccine which was my favorite was well seasoned and very tasty. Definitely recommend! Also had a slice of Pesto Lover pizza which was just okay, nothing special and also a slice of the Chicago style pizza (Sausage, cheese, and spinach). This was relatively good, but I also love pizza so there might be a little bias. We ate a lot, the food just coming!! Overall good experience, but there were some negatives. First, I noticed some issues with the cleanliness of the dining plates. To be servicing some high VP's from the organization I work for I was disappointed and had to ask for cleaner plates.

This was a salad that was lazily made because the BBQ sauce was poured over the shrimp after it was grilled. Also the BBQ sauce tasted like it was bottled BBQ sauce, sweet baby rays to be specific. Which wouldnt have been bad if the bbq sauce was on the shrimp while it was being grilled. Seems like it was poured on as an afterthought. The shrimp was grilled but didn't taste seasoned at all. Even though I didn't really care for the food that wouldn't have been worth a negative review if the staff was welcoming. The manager was just rude and told me it was fine with him if I never came back and wrote a review, after I told him why I was unhappy with the salad. When I attempted to send the salad back the same \"manager\" came to the table and said since I ordered it and there was nothing wrong with it except for the fact that I didn't like it and didn't think it was tasty, you have to order something else, \"but we can't take the salad off of your bill\". This was a salad that I ate one shrimp off of. The shrimp was not tasty at all. The \u00a0rubbery calamari could have been seasoned better as well so why would I order a third item?

Was that a granny smith? \u00a0A halved grape?Pockets is not that sandwich. \u00a0But it is somewhere between the two I mentioned.When you order a pocket, it's going to come on some seriously dense bread, like a pita but with added density. \u00a0And it's going to be chock-full of lettuce and the varied toppings that comes on your particular choice, dressing on the side. \u00a0So full, in fact, that the toppings will be scattered all onto your plate (or take-out box). \u00a0I've never ordered Pockets and still felt hungry. \u00a0Not even a little. \u00a0And I almost always order their salads as the bread is just a little too much for me. \u00a0You still get a nice nob of it, though, wrapped up in foil, which smells amazing and tastes decently.The thing about Pockets that keeps it at A-OK rather seriously impressive is that, despite what you order (I'm talking only salads and sandwiches here), it's always going to be a one-dimensional experience, much like my grandparents' sandwiches. \u00a0You can have some varied toppings, dress it up a little, but there's really one unified taste going on, which is to its credit a nice, crisp, fresh one, but nothing overly impactful. \u00a0That's why, in odd form, I order a side of the chips to go along with my meal, simply to mix it up a little. \u00a0The one thing that I do really like about Pockets is that their dressings manage to save an otherwise bland meal into something with a bit of zing. \u00a0That, and ordering the salad rather than the bread saves the taste from being too carb-laden which tends to mask the punch the dressing packs. \u00a0For bold flavor, The Popeye and its complementary house dressing is the winner. \u00a0Asking for both bacon and chicken takes it up a notch as well. \u00a0Honorable mentions include The Original w/ Turkey (aptly named, a simple and classic taste) and The Waldorf w/ Turkey (very sweet, almost like a dessert salad).All in all, Pockets is an A-OK choice for those nights when you'd rather not spend your time in your own kitchen whipping up a meal instead. \u00a0Order the right thing the right way and you may even find yourself craving it from time to time. 3 stars.", "rating": "3"}, "8": {"date": [2014, 10, 25], "description": "Their salads are a treat!

We'd ordered two old fashioneds ($8) but when they arrive, we both realized that they weren't made properly. The waitress admitted so as well. Not wanting to be complainers, my friend suggested adding a bit more Makers to each. The waitress returned with two shots of Makers. Certainly made the drink stronger but still a terrible Old Fashioned. When I received the check, there was a charge for the drink, upcharges for Makers and then a charge for each shot. This brought the drinks to almost $20/each. No manager on-site to speak with. In a hurry, I went ahead and paid the check. I reached out to Porkchop a couple of times, no response. The food was good. No complaints there. But I can't spend my money on bad service so there's no returning for me.

The only reason that I even stepped into this restaurant tonight was because the wait at Ja Grill was an hour to get a table.Since I'd never been before, I decided why not, and my friend got us a table.The first table we were seated at was entirely to high for both of us to feel comfortable. It felt like we were sitting in Alice in Wonderland seats after she shrunk. We were pretty quickly allowed to switch tables.....but no one told us it would be the forgotten table.Someone showed up pretty quickly to take our drink orders. The drinks came relatively quickly, so kudos for that. Shortly after the drinks came, I placed my order. Rib tips. They come with coleslaw and fries. Nothing too complicated. My friend was still deciding, so the waitress said she'd come back to take his order in a bit.30 minutes later, she hadn't come back. At this time, no one had been by to refill our water, or even to check on our well being. After about 3 attempts, we were able to flag down someone else to take his order, at which time our original waitress magically appeared at the table to grab the ticket. Like I said. I think we were at the forgotten table.We sat and chatted and sipped our drinks. 30 minutes later....nothing. After trying again for a couple of attempts we managed to flag down a different server to inquire about how much longer we would have to wait for our food to come out. We had been there for over an hour and watched several other tables get their food...but none was headed our way. After the server checked, food magically materialized!! But it was HIS food, not mine. Even though my order was placed 30 minutes before his! How is that even possible?! Seriously?! A new server that we had never seen before went to check and apparently my ticket had fallen out of the ticket line never to be seen again. 3 minutes after this, once again food magically appears. After an hour, I receive an order of rib tips smothered in bbq sauce.I'm no stranger to BBQ houses in Chicago, and of the ones I frequent, the tips are NEVER coated in sauce. When I ordered off of the menu, it said that 3 different sauces to choose from would be present at the table. So when my tips came with sauce already on, I was absolutely done. After I protested, the brand new server quickly removed those tips and came back with more stat. Kudos to her as well....she was the MVP of the moment. And for the record, our table came with one type of BBQ sauce and a container of catsup--not the three different types of sauce the menu promised.For the inconvenience, my friend and I were assured we would get a discount. None was provided. We quickly got to-go boxes, paid our bill, and left. And to add insult to injury.....the food was bland. I prefer my usual BBQ spots, and will never come to this restaurant again.

It took a few minutes for them to remake my salad and by that time the line had built up in front of me and I had to wait to pay. The only reason I didn't walk out is because I was really hungry. All this may sound minor, but when I'm paying $7 for a salad, I want it to be right! I also don't think its too much to ask for the staff to acknowledge me appropriately.

So many remainders but not enough quirky stuff (occasionally make some great picks... but when you see what you think is the only copy of The Sage and the Second Sex, for example, and you snag it, and then a month later you see four, and then you keep seeing two or three, you start to feel there's nothing really special about the place other than the name and the rep).Except for one cute brunette and another who's a Doctor Who fan, the staff is pretty cold. Almost surgically or antiseptically frigid. You shouldn't react to a question about what Will Oldham song is playing on your iPod the way you would as if I've asked if I could borrow your wife for the weekend. (I had to clean my fridge ALL BY MYSELF, thank you!) Also don't ignore someone who just got clocked in the head with your heavy metal front door. i don't care how engrossed you are in the prospective sale--you were maybe 15 inches away, and you're quite lucky I neither passed out in the doorway nor collapsed on the sidewalk in front of your free book box. That would have been a big lawsuit WIN for me.It makes me wonder why this store's still in business while Rodney's, a great Central Square Cambridge (MA) institution, has about a week of lifespan left. But then I remember: I'm not in Cambridge anymore--I'm in Chicago, a decaying (in the most Spenglerian sense) City State with absolutely no class or charm (fuck Art Deco--EVERY American city has Art Deco) and about fifty-five actually literate people in the Hyde Park neighborhood (maybe twenty of whom attend U of C). Anymore I pop in, glance the philosophy or the \u00a0poetry, and pop back out.Avenue Victor Hugo on Newbury Street in Boston. Twenty-nine years, and a total Ayn Rand worshipping test tube baby schitzo running the place, but it had character and class and tradition and rep and the best sci-fi collection in the Northeastern United States. All Powell's has is rep. Worth the pop in, but don't be surprised if you pop quickly out. It doesn't really encourage the browsing that even O'Gara and Wilson across the street does.NOTE: I have to admit that it's really just awesome to see a pompous U of C git try to pick up a chick by impressing them with his ability to read the names \"Hegel\" and \"Fichte\" from the spines of the philosophy section. German's tough but the pronunciation of his surname is probably the most accessible thing about Kant. \"Ah... yes... I think you would really like Nietzsche...\" Had I not been engaged to one, I would have probably been able to pick up the pretty Asian woman who had also been in the aisle on that afternoon on sole account of \u00a0the knowing glance and smirk we exchanged after this guy and..

None of this \"Seattle's Best\" or \"Starbucks\" nonsense, no \"Caf\u00e9,\" just books. It works.

The graffiti is great, and there are very few places outside of Hyde Park where one could find the bathroom graffiti conversations that are on this wall. May they never paint over it!3.) The books are very well priced for a used bookstore, and are in great condition, usually like new. There are never underlined pages, tobacco stains, etc. If you buy a tshirt or a tote bag from them they give you even more discounts on books at various events throughout the year.4.) Being in Hyde Park, this place has so many great academic books. It has huge sections in philosophy, sociology, poetry, gender studies, classical studies, \u00a0and every other social science/humanities field imaginable. They don't have a large science section but those books tend to be dated rather quickly due to their nature.5.) Very convenient location near the Metra track on 57th, across from a gelato shop!Areas for improvement:1.) The books are not in exact alphabetical order.

My taste buds have enjoyed his work up until his departure in 2011. In 2012, there was a noticeable change in the kitchen. The quality of the food has declined as well as the flavors. I am surprised and dumb-founded by the recent reviews because I have experienced both catered and normal service to be poor. At a catered departmental event, an entree choice was delivered in the form of three flat falafels, 2 inches in diameter that were completely bland. The only edible part of the meal were two broccoli florets that actually saw some salt. Out of starvation you have to consume the brick that is a dinner roll, the 5-leaf boxed salad with a generous lone cherry tomato, and the chocolate cake. Can't tell you if the chocolate cake was actually good because anything tastes good when you're starving. Most recently, I accompanied an emeritus professor to lunch at the Quad Club hoping for better and receiving disappointment once again. I have learned to keep it simple because who can mess up simple, what food establishment is going to risk poor pasta? The Quad Club that is! Fettucine is pasta in sauce with some vegetables. What I receive is gluten mush because the pasta is overcooked, and terrible sauce. The oil had started to separate from the rest of the sauce. The vegetables again overcooked. At least I tasted something, but it was so forgettable that I can't tell you what that flavor was. For an establishment that conveys exclusivity and pretentiousness, please execute, because I too can lay down a white table cloth, pour an Arnold Palmer, and microwave a frozen dinner to achieve my experiences at The Quad Club.", "rating": "1"}, "14": {"date": [2013, 10, 4], "description": "I held my wedding reception at the Quadrangle Club, and I was quite pleased. \u00a0My husband sampled the food prior to the wedding as was not impressed. \u00a0I was a bit nervous because I really wanted the venue since we were getting married at Bond Chapel. \u00a0Fortunately, the food for the wedding was great!

The rice is good, though I feel that it's a little pricey for something I wish was included. The samosas are not my favorite. I find them to be heavy and oily. I have not tried any of the soul food. My only real complaint is I wished they served naan or parantha; their roti bread is just not as good. Service: Always courteous and quickly delivered.Ambiance: Has been newly renovated, which is nice because it does feel like a place you could now sit down in.

So he new owner decided not to change the name, and instead to offer both North Indian and Southern delicacies. As far as I know it's the only place where you can buy collard greens and samosas, tandoori chicken and cornbread, or daal, mac'n'cheese, and naan. The curries are pretty good, if a bit on he heavy side, and the collard greens and other southern dishes are decent as well. It's hardly the place for standouts in either genre, but it's a great place to grab a quick bite, especially since it tends to be open pretty late at night. It's also a very casual place in which meals are fetched on plastic trays, you'll use plastic silverware, and cardboard takeout boxes packed with styrofoam containers. The restaurant is a common student hangout, which isn't much of a problem since the restaurant can only fit 5-7 tables worth of people, and it seems to have just as many local patrons.

I knew that the Alabama bar was not going to work today because it would have been a production (think get there 2 hours prior and hope you can get a seat). My requirements were, quality television, unobstructed views, decent food, and reasonably priced drinks (since I was going to be there for all 4 quarters).A friend recommended Seven Ten Lanes.. and it did not disappoint. I walked in to a pretty spacious bar area and plopped down. I asked the bartender (Robin, I think) if we could switch one of the tvs to the game at kick-off. DONE. Asked me was I eating and was I drinking.. YAAY for service.I started with the Fried Pickles and they were terrible. I got nervous that my minimum requirement of decent was not going to happen. The bartender said get the chicken philly with no mushrooms, light onions, and jalepenos on the side. I said SOLD. IT came out and when I tell you this thing was DELICIOUS! Oh goodness. I couldn't have been happier. My friend ordered the catfish nuggets and that did not disappoint either.Then let's talk about the beer selection. From drafts to bottles from coast to coast to country to country, I was in heaven. I decided to work my way through their Weiss beers, a few locals, and some ciders. I couldn't complain.The short, I left with Alabama pulling out the W, a full belly, and a more experienced beer palette.

These dance parties are mainly for people from the UofC to come practice their salsa, bachata and cha cha. The DJ always presents a great selection, the dancers are friendly and there are all levels, although there are usually more dancers on the 'learning' end than the 'advanced' end. The floor can be a little slick, so I'd actually recommend rubber soled shoes, for once.The staff are always quick to provide pitchers of water, and the full bar (though these are all-ages parties) is great.

Well all of that changed when the bill came. Our waitress Deloras A. separated our bills for us (thanks) everyone paid everything was fine, then we noticed that there was an extra bill on the table for a 6th item (in which only 5 were ordered and already paid for) when she returned to the table to get the receipts she asked who was going to pay for the item on the receipt? (huh??) We responded by saying \"you charged 6 times instead of 5, we've paid for everything already.\" In my mind that was her que to say \"Oh wow sorry have a good evening\" Well lets just say things went down hill from there. She went to get her manager Juan Alcantar who came over and demanded that someone pay for this item (let me remind you NO ONE ORDERED IT) , once again we are defending ourselves pulling out paid receipts showing the both of them that she made a mistake and everything was paid for. Instead of apologizing and stopping the harassment he told us that we were thieves and should not go out and order things that we cannot pay for. At that point we were very upset and voices were raised (as we had every right to be upset). At that point we realized it was useless to carry on asked him to move out of our way so that we can go, then he says that he is going to call the police (why are we calling the police??) screamed for us to leave and never return (As if we would ever go back). I told them that I was going to call corporate because this was the most ridiculous thing I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Well today I contacted Michael Lamagcki at 773.472.1601 I left a voicemail and he did call back about 20 minutes later I explained to him what took place and how offended we were to be called thieves and be yelled at. Well long story short Mike backed his workers and had the nerve to tell me that his staff felt threatened and BELITTLED by us because we yelled......So let me try to make sense of this, your staff rung up 6 items instead of 5, all 5 were paid for, instead of your staff acknowledging their mistake they insist that we pay call us thieves (because thieves pay for things they purchase) threaten to call the police and refer to us as \"you people\" BUT your staff handled that well.....I will never go to another 7/10 lounge or support any business that MIKE LAMAGCKI runs.", "rating": "1"}, "7": {"date": [2015, 7, 26], "description": "Had a black sangria an smoked a cigar outside an some chicken wings great spot to drink an smoke", "rating": "4"}, "8": {"date": [2015, 6, 19], "description": "Fries were hard.

First, this place has an incredible lunch and dinner special -- rice, soup, egg roll, your dish, for $8-$11. The choice is limited, but there are great things.

But there is enough space for a lot of people to come in even without a reservation.While many of the dishes are really great, I've had a couple things here that are genuinely gross (one of them was the roast duck soup; sounds good in theory, not so good in practice -- though I had a friend who LOVES it, so who knows). Look out for these in the reviews -- I really do think that the mixed reviews on Siam come from people who chose poorly. If you order well, this place is amazing.It's BYOB, and if you bring your own beer or wine, they'll help you open it and give you glasses and no sass.

They have two brands of tea - Republic of Tea and Stash. I mentioned that I didn't like Stash tea so I'd like a Republic of Tea plain green tea. They didn't have any more of it. So I said, ok, I'll have a Republic of Tea Earl Grey tea (it's a black tea - I wanted caffeine). I saw him reaching for Stash tea so I reminded him that I didn't want Stash. He reaches elsewhere, pulls out a tea bag, puts it in hot water and hands it to me. I go sit down and realize after it starts to steep that he has given me some chamomile hibiscus herbal nonsense. \u00a0I take it back and tell him this is chamomile tea, not Earl Grey. He tells me, \"We didn't have it so I gave you another type of green tea.\" \u00a0I say, \"Wait, I don't think you know what green tea is...\" The cashier, a woman, then opens the cash register and tells me she's going to refund my money because there's nothing more she can do for me.

Here I was hoping to get a palatable cup of tea only to find that they don't know what they're doing. Owner of Sip & Savor, if you're reading this: you need to educate yourself on teas so that your staff can learn the basics about tea and not be so confused. Herbal teas are not green tea. Change your menu before you embarrass yourself further. Sure, your barista should have known that Earl Grey is listed under black tea and shouldn't have substituted a \"green\" tea, especially without asking me first, but I get the sense that if management is confused, the staff are going to come across like they don't know what they're doing or saying.", "rating": "1"}, "33": {"date": [2014, 8, 25], "description": "This cute place has a stay a while and chat vibe.

I tried a tuna sandwich on a croissant (I would have preferred a choice of regular bread). I specifically said I did not want the sandwich heated. Even so, I got a sandwich that had been microwaved, so the croissant lost all its crisp and the tuna was hot. Worse, it was overly salty. When I took it back, the person got really impatient and began making another sandwich in a huffy way. I had to clarify that I just wanted my money back. I really appreciated that they took the food back and refunded my money. That says they are committed to me being happy with what I get here. Still, I would rather have had a fresh sandwich for lunch.

I was now pretty frustrated as this seems an thoroughly inexcusable mistake. I walked back to the 'salon', showed him the issue, he told me to wait, then had me come to a chair and said 'what's the problem?'. I told him to look and notice that he had left the left side bizarrely longer than the hacked-at right side. He started hacking again at the left side and said 'there. is that what you want?' Immediately seeing that it was still markedly uneven (see second picture), I asked him if it looked even to him. His response was a seemingly incredulous 'you want both sides the same length?' Very irritated at this point, I responded 'No, I'd actually like the right side about a half foot shorter than the left side'. He rudely responded 'suit yourself' and turned his back on me and went back to hacking at the hair of the person next to me.I'm extremely disappointed not only at the waste of money but at Tamer's inexcusably rude demeanor, lack of acknowledgement of having seriously screwed up my hair, and at the waste of time and more money that I'll now expend to repair his rude, lazy, incompetence.Additional tidbits:-Place is smoky with incense.-Tamer smells like a cigarette.-They talk in (?)

Thai is absolutely my favorite food, however their thai was not authentic. It seemed like very Americanized thai. First off, they say that their pad thai is made with \"Pad Thai sauce\" and usually it's tamarind sauce. Their pad thai is drenched in what tastes like syrup. It's really sweet and the smell is so strong I want to gag. Traditional pad thai is supposed to be a neutral contrast between sweet and sour, their pad thai was overly sweet and didn't even have the sourness of the tamarind sauce. The only thing okay was the tofu in it. Their bubble milk tea is nothing too memorable, just that the bubbles were not as fresh as it could've been.Service of the place was definitely below my standards after reading what others claimed. My friends and I walked in and only after a minute did they seat us. Not really a big deal, but fine. We were seated at a booth and the male waiter kind of threw the menus on the table.

It wasn't bad, but not prompt. But, I generally like to judge a restaurant on the food more than on the service, as it's really the food that I go to a restaurant for. As for the food, I ordered the red curry with chicken, and it was not good. It was actually pretty bad, and it's pretty difficult to make bad curry. The first thing I noticed was that the curry was not anywhere close to red. I know red curry isn't usually red, but more of a deep orange to pale orange. This curry was a pale white yellowy color with some bits of orange stuff floating around. The second thing I noticed, which was much more worrisome, was that it was very liquidy, like it was watered down. The taste was very bland, so it probably was. The description said the curry was \"simmered with herbs and coconut milk\". I couldn't taste any herbs, or much of anything other than a vague sweetness. There was a faint trace of coconut too, but I doubt there was much coconut milk in there considering how watered down it was. The chicken was mediocre and a bit dry, which could've been forgiven had the actual curry itself been good. The rice was average, if a bit dry. Again, could've been forgiven if the curry had any taste. Everything together though, just makes for one bad curry. My friends ordered pad thai, and those looked and smelled decent, hence the 2 stars. If I was just reviewing on the curry alone, it would've been 1 star. I rarely eat a curry I dislike so much.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I think any Thai place worth its salt should at least be able to make a decent curry alongside the usual pad thai.", "rating": "2"}, "47": {"date": [2013, 12, 20], "description": "I've been here once on a date.

I ordered a dirty martini. I needed something strong and salty to bear these noises. When the waiter brought it over, complete with canned olives, he said \"$5.50 please.\" I nearly fell off my chair. Five and a half bucks for a dirty martini?

The Cove is the type of place that I would expect to find out where I grew up (Crookfield, IL), back in the day that is (because today the town is too \"upscale\" and you have to drive all the way to Lyons to find a real dive bar). Trust me, I like dive bars, and this place is a fine specimen. In my opinion a dive bar is most of, or all of the following: - not going to go out of their way to serve you decent beer (I think this place has four beers on tap- three of which are Miller products and the third one might have been Coors Light; plus, to top it off, a fellow Yelper pointed out that they serve Kirkland brand beer by the can... That's right, Costco beer!!!) - food is limited (or in the case of The Cove- non existent, unless you bring your own crock pot of chili) - glasses for your draughts need to be reused - TV entertainment comes in the form of cheap old box-style TVs with bunny ear antennas (this is where The Cove fails because actually their TVs are very nice!) - At any given time no more than one or two people on the payroll working so you need to make sure drinks are ordered before bath room and smoke breaks- bathrooms are oddly configured (I heard the women's room was clean, but the men's stalls were right by the door with no lock that were clearly open to anyone passing by if the door opened) - cheap options for when you want to get your drink on - regulars who can tell you all about how much (little) the place has changed over the last twenty or so years (including the price of a drink) So while Skylark is nice if you want to pretend that you are at a dive, The Cove is more the real deal Holyfield.", "rating": "3"}, "41": {"date": [2010, 1, 11], "description": "I have mixed feelings about Cove Lounge.It's an old man bar, which I like, and the drinks were CHEEAAAP!! \u00a0They were gracious enough to let us host the Yelp chili cook-off and the owner and bartender were very nice. \u00a0The side room where we had our chili was pretty big with large tables and benches...picnic table style! \u00a0There were also a couple of flat screens to watch the Bengals lose their playoff game (*snicker*). \u00a0I had to take a star off for something that is out of the bar's control and that is the clientele. \u00a0While some of them were very nice, others were just not.

If you're not a foodie, and just wondering whether or not you should eat here... eat here. I think it is awesome that after every dining experience with The Promontory, I have so much to say. This restaurant is truly offering not just exceptional food, but an complete gastronomical experience. I arrived to The Promontory an hour earlier than my reservation, just to have a drink or two before dinner began. They were very accommodating to seat us an hour early at our reserved table with a view of the open kitchen. We always enjoy watching the chefs interact with one another as you can very plainly see they are one big playful family. After our pre-dinner bubbly, the Sommelier brought out our first course. The Maine lobster was perfectly chilled, tender, and plenty. The oyster mayo was really brightened up by the addition of mustard seeds, that lead to a perfectly creamy yet tangy sauce. The salmon roe that highlight the fish notes without overtaking the entire dish and of course are a beautiful addition to the presentation. The bed of yuzu toasted brioche added just the right amount of sweetness. The frisee played a role aesthetics as well as bringing a fresh and crisp factor to the dish. Overall, perfectly composed dish with an expertly paired with Ca' Bosco Brut from Franciacorta.The second course was a well planned preview of the upcoming rich and earthy and away from the sweet and creamy by marrying the two flavor profiles. The transition was presented as a celery root agnolotti, with properly cooked pasta and subtle earthy celery filling. The creamy richness of the cauliflower soubise and roasted vegetable demi were cut by the crisp bitterness of the treviso. This course was beautifully paired with the refreshing Heidler Gruner Veltliner. A surprise course was added to the menu, the chef's experimental savory version of financiers. It was very obvious which of the two was onion flavored but he cheddar was not as pronounced. The cookies were moist and dense, and almost sticky. I loved that we got to partake in the chef's playful experiment! The last time I dined the Tuesday Tasting menu, the beef course was strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree. This time the beef course consisted of Waygu strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree... sound familiar? Basically, same exact dish but with an exponentially better execution and wine pairing the second go 'round. The steak was cooked to the chef's preference, as it should always be. A gorgeous steak presentation that melted like butter in your mouth. A satisfyingly rich and earthy course that paired so well with the comparable notes in the Jason Stephens Cabernet Sauvignon.The last savory course of the night was a Kentucky Burgoo composed of venison sausage, turkey roulade, smoke pork belly, braise butter beans, and the M.I.A. pickled okra. To my pleasant surprise, this dish was not overly salty as I had expected. With pork belly and venision sausage on the menu, I was prepared for the saltiness to shine. The pork belly was expertly salted, infused with natural smoke flavors, and was oh so tender. I was so happy to taste that the venison sausage was well seasoned, had an absence of game flavor, and great mouth feel from the casing to stuffing. As soon as I saw what was on the menu for dessert, I could not wait to have it in front of me. Coffee and Doughnuts paired with Boulder Beer Co.'s Shake Chocolate Porter on nitro. When you write something like that on the menu, people are bound to get excited. I know I was excited, until I saw the dread grapefruit marmalade. Dessert came out and as always, gorgeously presented. A yeast doughnut, a doughnut hole filled with grapefruit marmalade, and coffee cremeux. I completely understand the concept of pairing acids with richly decedent flavors, but I can't handle the execution. Next time, I'll have to pass on the citrus marmalade. At The Promontory, there's an open kitchen where you can see all the chef's preparing the main dishes. However, there's an elusive, mad scientist of a pastry chef that hides in the back and conjours up wild desserts. Coffee foam, that's not so crazy, but not still not found on your average dessert. The kicker? Grapefruit powder. It looks like powered sugar but tastes like your eating afresh slice of grapefruit. Oh, the magical powers of molecular gastronomy.The third time must really be the charm, because I left completely entranced. Compared to my last experience, the food seemed to be more thoughtfully composed and purposefully prepared. The Sommelier did an exceptional job pairing with every dish, not just as a \u00a0compliment, but to complete the course.Well done.", "rating": "5"}, "11": {"date": [2016, 1, 20], "description": "Alright so can I start off being honest???Ok.

Just four years ago, there was no movie theater, no Chipotle, no fancy coffee shops (Plein Air, I'm looking at you) or fancy boutique stores, and certainly very few \"hip\" eateries ... do I sound like an old grandma yet?The Promontory, while definitely not perfect, really classes up the Hyde Park food scene. I've had the pleasure of dining there twice - the first time for dinner, then for a weekday lunch a year later - and it's definitely worth a trip if you find yourself in Hyde Park (though maybe not if you're thinking of coming all the way from downtown Chicago).Venue / Ambiance:+ Rustic, airy, and open are the three adjectives I'd use to describe the setting (lots of wood and hanging bulbs). In the daytime, the ubiquitous windows and high ceilings let light flood the restaurant, creating a very bright space. In the evenings, it's a bit of a different story - The Promontory keeps the lighting a little on the dimmer side, creating a cabin-like, cozy feel.+ The noise level here can vary greatly. When the house is packed (e.g., prime time dinner), it can be very loud - but if you're looking for a quiet meal, a quick jaunt to the Promontory during lunch (if you have the time, of course) might be best. I went on a Thursday afternoon somewhere around 12:30, and my friend and I were one of maybe about 3-4 parties in total.Food:+ I got dinner with a group of friends back in 2014, and remember that the kalbi short ribs were the standout. Unfortunately, I don't remember which other dishes we liked - but not every dish was a winner: out of the 8 or so dishes we had, there were two or three we didn't care for. In addition, I remember we thought the portion size wasn't the biggest (I think we actually ordered three orders of the kalbi, haha!). Of course, this was all a while ago, so things have likely changed, so I'd ask the waiters/waitresses what they'd recommend!+ Lunch was much more recent (October 2015) and my friend and I shared the Fried Chicken Sandwich and The Point Breakfast (both pictured here). Unlike with dinner, the portions were generous - we both left already deep into our food comas - and in true comfort food style, both dishes had good flavor. (I might have preferred the Chicken Sandwich, if only because I'm a sucker for fried chicken.)Service:+ Both times I came, the wait staff was friendly and helpful. In particular, the first time I went, I specifically called ahead to tell the restaurant that someone in my party had a birthday, and to arrange some sort of birthday surprise. Since they hadn't been open for too long, they told me that the restaurant didn't have any candles or specific birthday specials ... but if I wanted to bring candles, and any dessert of my own (or pick any of the desserts from their menu), they'd be happy to arrange & bring out the dessert and sing happy birthday. So I brought candles and everything went pretty smoothly :)Overall: The Promontory is a restaurant that delivers a wonderful environment and solid food. If you're looking for good dining in Hyde Park, it's definitely a good choice (happy hour here seems like it would be a fun affair). But it's solid in the way that many other Chicago restaurants are, so if you're already downtown or more than a stone's throw away from Hyde Park, I'd take a raincheck for the next time you're actually in Hyde Park.", "rating": "4"}, "33": {"date": [2015, 11, 21], "description": "Had food with a friend on a chilly winter's day.

I had the grilled gulf prawns with sweet potato, ham hock, smoked pear, braised kale ($15). Portions were small but surprisingly filling. It was overall a good dish, with the smoked pear complementing the prawns. The down side was that the kale was excessively salty, felt like I was drowning in the ocean.

If you're not a foodie, and just wondering whether or not you should eat here... eat here. I think it is awesome that after every dining experience with The Promontory, I have so much to say. This restaurant is truly offering not just exceptional food, but an complete gastronomical experience. I arrived to The Promontory an hour earlier than my reservation, just to have a drink or two before dinner began. They were very accommodating to seat us an hour early at our reserved table with a view of the open kitchen. We always enjoy watching the chefs interact with one another as you can very plainly see they are one big playful family. After our pre-dinner bubbly, the Sommelier brought out our first course. The Maine lobster was perfectly chilled, tender, and plenty. The oyster mayo was really brightened up by the addition of mustard seeds, that lead to a perfectly creamy yet tangy sauce. The salmon roe that highlight the fish notes without overtaking the entire dish and of course are a beautiful addition to the presentation. The bed of yuzu toasted brioche added just the right amount of sweetness. The frisee played a role aesthetics as well as bringing a fresh and crisp factor to the dish. Overall, perfectly composed dish with an expertly paired with Ca' Bosco Brut from Franciacorta.The second course was a well planned preview of the upcoming rich and earthy and away from the sweet and creamy by marrying the two flavor profiles. The transition was presented as a celery root agnolotti, with properly cooked pasta and subtle earthy celery filling. The creamy richness of the cauliflower soubise and roasted vegetable demi were cut by the crisp bitterness of the treviso. This course was beautifully paired with the refreshing Heidler Gruner Veltliner. A surprise course was added to the menu, the chef's experimental savory version of financiers. It was very obvious which of the two was onion flavored but he cheddar was not as pronounced. The cookies were moist and dense, and almost sticky. I loved that we got to partake in the chef's playful experiment! The last time I dined the Tuesday Tasting menu, the beef course was strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree. This time the beef course consisted of Waygu strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree... sound familiar? Basically, same exact dish but with an exponentially better execution and wine pairing the second go 'round. The steak was cooked to the chef's preference, as it should always be. A gorgeous steak presentation that melted like butter in your mouth. A satisfyingly rich and earthy course that paired so well with the comparable notes in the Jason Stephens Cabernet Sauvignon.The last savory course of the night was a Kentucky Burgoo composed of venison sausage, turkey roulade, smoke pork belly, braise butter beans, and the M.I.A. pickled okra. To my pleasant surprise, this dish was not overly salty as I had expected. With pork belly and venision sausage on the menu, I was prepared for the saltiness to shine. The pork belly was expertly salted, infused with natural smoke flavors, and was oh so tender. I was so happy to taste that the venison sausage was well seasoned, had an absence of game flavor, and great mouth feel from the casing to stuffing. As soon as I saw what was on the menu for dessert, I could not wait to have it in front of me. Coffee and Doughnuts paired with Boulder Beer Co.'s Shake Chocolate Porter on nitro. When you write something like that on the menu, people are bound to get excited. I know I was excited, until I saw the dread grapefruit marmalade. Dessert came out and as always, gorgeously presented. A yeast doughnut, a doughnut hole filled with grapefruit marmalade, and coffee cremeux. I completely understand the concept of pairing acids with richly decedent flavors, but I can't handle the execution. Next time, I'll have to pass on the citrus marmalade. At The Promontory, there's an open kitchen where you can see all the chef's preparing the main dishes. However, there's an elusive, mad scientist of a pastry chef that hides in the back and conjours up wild desserts. Coffee foam, that's not so crazy, but not still not found on your average dessert. The kicker? Grapefruit powder. It looks like powered sugar but tastes like your eating afresh slice of grapefruit. Oh, the magical powers of molecular gastronomy.The third time must really be the charm, because I left completely entranced. Compared to my last experience, the food seemed to be more thoughtfully composed and purposefully prepared. The Sommelier did an exceptional job pairing with every dish, not just as a \u00a0compliment, but to complete the course.Well done.", "rating": "5"}, "35": {"date": [2015, 11, 20], "description": "Loved the music and ambiance.

As she ripped my hair out, I decided to mitigate some of the damage by suggesting she use the big red detangling comb sitting a few inches away on the counter. \u00a0She did for about 3 minutes, then went back to the small comb. \u00a0I even asked her to give me the large comb and detangled half my own hair so I wouldn't walk out bald. \u00a0My inner voice was screaming \"Don't let this woman cut your hair.\" \u00a0By this time I was pretty worried, but since I had a head full of pre-poo conditioner, I went with it for a bit longer. \u00a0She washed my hair and left me sitting at the bowl for about 10 minutes while she finished up another customer and swept her station. \u00a0No explanation. \u00a0The manager came by and asked if I were relaxed. \u00a0I hid my rage.When we returned to her chair for the blowout portion, I realized things were going even further south. \u00a0She used a blow dryer comb attachment to dry my hair. \u00a0Now, my hair is fine, but it's CURLY. \u00a0I have broken the teeth of many a comb attachment in my day. \u00a0As she ripped through each section to \"detangle\" with the tiny tooth comb, she would stop blow drying about 3 inches from my ends. \u00a0I think she was preparing to cut the rest of that length off because it was too tangled. \u00a0 Again, I asked her to detangle with the wide tooth comb. \u00a0Again, she used it for about 4 minutes and went right back to her tiny tooth friend.I stayed through the end of my blow dry to avoid walking out with wet hair. \u00a0The very moment she finished, I bailed. \u00a0I asked for my bill because I believe in paying for the products used. I was extremely unhappy, however, because my hair looked worse than when I came in. \u00a0The manager found me fuming in the store and ripped up the bill so I wouldn't have to pay. \u00a0She was nice enough and said she understood there were problems with the service. \u00a0She even offered to finish my service and trim herself if I didn't mind waiting for her to finish another customer. \u00a0 I picked up a paddle brush to use for blow drying my own hair and promptly left.I ended up blow-drying my own hair and only had to trim about a half-inch. \u00a0My blowout looks way smoother and more professional than hers did. \u00a0Although the customer service from the manager was nice, \u00a0I will never visit this Ulta salon again.TL;DR: \u00a0listen to your inner voice and avoid this salon if you care for your natural hair.", "rating": "1"}, "12": {"date": [2014, 11, 16], "description": "Girls rejoice.

Most of the time I don't mind being left alone to browse. However, the last several times I have gone looking for a specific product I wasn't asked once if I needed anything by the multiple employees that passed by. The main reason why I wanted to write this review is because of the lack of skill in the salon. I made an appointment for a no-chip manicure with Kimberly, as the other nail salon in Hyde Park that offers no-chip has also had poor reviews. First of all, nail shapes should not be limited to square or round. When I asked her to follow the natural curve of my nail, I ended up having a minimally filed nail that was not uniformly shaped and symmetrical. Maybe my request for a natural look threw her off, but I also suspect her square and round techniques would also be asymmetrical. Secondly, if I wanted my nails to look like I had done them all with my non-dominant hand instead of salon-quality, I would have saved myself the $25. Some nails weren't painted close enough to the cuticle, leaving it appear as if my nails had grown out since I had them painted. Other nails were painted beyond the side of the nail onto the skin, allowing the polish to peel away thereafter as gel nail polish does not cure on skin. Once the top coat was applied and cured, she went back and touched up spots with the colored polish but didn't go back over those spots with more topcoat, leaving dull spots (not shiny like the topcoat) over multiple areas in my nails. What I gathered from some of the conversation was that she was trained by Ulta, not necessarily receiving formal training specific to nails like a nail technician. \u00a0It doesn't take a genius to apply no-chip polish, but it does take some skill from beginning to end. In fact, I own a UV light and Shellac polishes but I think I don't do a salon-quality job so I'd rather have someone else make them look nice. My mistake...I'll do them myself.", "rating": "2"}, "18": {"date": [2014, 10, 16], "description": "Overall my hair turned out ok, but you get what you paid for. I am in the process of growing out my asymmetrical bob which is now past my shoulders and needed to get a trim to even out the ends and de-bulk my hair around the neck as it has gotten thick and heavy. My hair is medium in texture, shoulder length and I have a lot of it! I always bring a picture of a cut that I want to make it easier to communicate with the stylist as to what I'm asking for. The girl that cut my hair was new and I think I may have been her first client ever...she took forever! and only did half of what I requested (just a trim) because frankly I think by the time she finished trimming the hair she was either too tired or ran out of time. So she never went through the hair to take out the bulk and thin it out. The manager had to come over 10 times to help her and give her advice on how to cut hair, what tools to use, what products to use, where the clips are..the hairbrushes...she didn't know SQUAT ... I understand she was new, but common! as a client I want to feel that my hairdresser is in control and knows what she/he is doing, needless to say that didn't help the process either. Afterwards I felt pressured by the hairdresser and the manager to book another appointment to get my color done, but because of the experience I got I do not trust them to do a good job on my hair, so I will not be going back.", "rating": "2"}, "19": {"date": [2014, 4, 26], "description": "When I go into this store, Im normally in and out.

There was even an additional salesperson behind the counter just kind of walking around behind the registers opening and closing boxes and cabinets.

I wish I could give -5 stars. I wish that was an option. The other weekend I went and got my haircut... I usually go to the aveda schools, so my standards aren't crazy high. I had a friend who said if I needed someone for haircuts, this lady at ulta was great! Unfortunately, she was not available. Instead, I had a guy cut my hair, I don't remember his hair, but he was a \"master stylist\" and usually his cuts were $53, but since I was quoted $37, that's the price I would get... But he definitely made me very aware his price is usually $53. Well, my haircut isn't difficult. I wanted a simple bob. I had about 4 different images explaining what I wanted. I had a picture of the exact line I wanted (slightly longer in the front since I curl my hair and it's thin so it being longer in the front looks better) \u00a0he told me I had a dominate jawline and a hard angle, right on my jaw, wouldn't be flattering... I wasn't asking for a hard line... Just a bob cut slightly above my shoulders, with a few texture layers, and longer in the front... Well, apparently he had issues listening, or needs glasses, but the front of my hair is SHORTER than the back. The cut isn't anything that I asked for and I wish I could have my tip back. Once he was finished I didn't look closely, paid, and left. I was scared to actually look at my haircut. I thought, maybe he styled it poorly and just pinned it back. The next day, when I tried to style it, I wanted to break down in tears. My hair looks so bad I can't even curl it and wear it down. I have never had a worse haircut in my life and feel like I went to get a $10 haircut. Now, I have to wear my hair up until it grows out enough so I can get it fixed.

After going here for eyebrow waxes for several years, I'm done with them. There are several reasons I wouldn't recommend waxing services here. First and foremost is that they charge the same price as many nice salons ($20 for brows) but the customer service is not good. They are aggressive about calling my cell phone to make an appointment with me. However, on three different occasions when I've made an appointment, I've arrived at my \"appointment\" only to find that the waxer is not there. Either she's running late or called in sick. I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise, but all I'd ask is that this place call the customers who've made appointments and let them know that the appointment is cancelled or needs to be rescheduled. I shouldn't have to find this out after I'm already there. It's kinda rude, guys. The last straw though was the completely awful wax I got the last time I was there. I've been growing in the inside corners of my brows for months. This waxer (who was the person who recommended I grow them in in the first place) just slapped wax on without asking me what I wanted, and ruined the look I was going for. There was no communication about it at all and now I hate my brows. I really don't like paying money for a service that wasn't what I wanted and makes me look worse than when I went in.

The woman was completely unhelpful on where I should tie him up. No one asked if I needed help, so I had to flag down a salesperson. I was trying to find a certain color of lipgloss, and instead of putting any effort into looking for that color, she peered into where it should be and just said \"must be out.' Well thank you. I then had to wait in line behind 3 people while the ONE salesperson waited on the manager to do a return. Meanwhile, there were other salespeople just standing around doing nothing. I watched the manager \"help\" the girl with the return and she was not nice at all. I could tell the girl was frustrated and the manager did nothing to help and turned her away. Finally, I was able to pay for my purchases. I had a 20% off coupon, but no one told me it wouldn't work on \"prestige\" items like Stila, etc. So really I couldn't really use it on the stuff that I wanted.

You have only 2 beauty specialists on the floor and they are both doing full makeovers on people gabbing over God knows what while an indesicive new costumer with an obvious look of desperation on he face (ME) is walking around wasting her time. I've come in before with no one on the floor and literally have to track someone down. Like I did today..again.. I came in looking for a simple wine matte lipstick. Not too hard right? Im a simple gal. So after searching and being disappointed because all of my picks were out, I finally find someone on the floor to suggest a product. Right off bat, I sensed an attitude. So she pulls a lipstick tester for a color that I loved ! Not even willing to assist me in cleaning or giving her opinion, she POINTS ME to the cleaners and mirrors and abruptly walks off. Uhm..ok .. Well turns out the color looked awesome and I'm so excited i finally find what I wanted. So I go back to get the packaged product and what do I find, THEY ARE ALL OUT. Way to Go lady. What a great suggestion.

It's a great local store, and carries a number of products that are difficult if not impossible to find in Hyde Park. I used to live about a block away, so I'd always head over for late-night or last-minute groceries. They're open until 9pm (or they were last I checked), which makes them the only evening option for groceries in the neighborhood, unless you count CVS. I don't recommend them for fresh produce, as they usually only have a few wilted specimens, although they have ginger, garlic, and onions which I'm sure are fine. They have the usual mini-mart selection of a few cheeses (including some interesting canned fresh cheeses with labels I can't read but buy nevertheless), eggs, milk, and creamer, as well as a dizzying array of sodas, Arizona teas, and fruit juices, many of which are rarer brands not sold elsewhere. Some paper goods and cleaners, and an aisle full of typical dry and canned goods. Since it's a smaller store the prices are a little higher than at bigger grocery chains but not significantly so. The highlight is, of course, the more hard-to-find middle eastern products they sell. Dried fruits and nuts, spices, curry paste and sauce, preserves, flavored molasses, various sweets, etc. For a while they had big jars of coconut oil at a great price, which made me especially happy. I have actually never even tried any of the deli side, but the prices on deli look decent and they do offer sandwiches and the like. Customer service is varying, but about typical for a small hole-in-the-wall grocery. I've found the owner and his employees to be on the whole very accommodating (he once ordered an item he no longer carried for me because I mentioned to him that I missed it).

If you catch them while they have fresh meat coming in (which is every couple of days) it's probably the cheapest in the area.

When you talk to this portion of the staff, you get the impression that they're thinking something like \"I know this place is a disaster, but we're gonna get through this together with the least amount of frustration possible\".

And I do mean all of my life; my earliest memories include staring out my bedroom window at Rockefeller Chapel. While the building I was living in has been knocked down and replaced Twice!!!, Jimmy's is still there. My dad worked on his PhD. at the U of C, and much later on I went to the Lutheran School of Theology for my masters, and came back and got my DMin. degree at one of the other seminaries. So the place wasn't just full of U of C students and professors, it was also overflowing with theologians, pastors, neighbors, lawyers, doctors from the hospital, and everyone else you can imagine. It was kind of weird for me as a young adult because I never knew when one of my parents or brothers might walk in, or the janitor from St. Thomas Apostle, across the street, where I had gone to school.Before I started seminary you could count on my best friend and I being there a couple of nights a week -- and like everyone else I know, we met a lot of guys. It doesn't fit the place, but one night we had the pleasure of allowing a couple of construction workers pick up the tab for a few hours. One guy bet the other guy he wouldn't toss down one of those \"game\" drinks. The first guy had his and rushed to the John to improve his health. The next guy followed, but he did a better job of keeping his act together by making sure that the bathroom door was open and the seat was up, before he gulped down a shot of cheap whiskey, followed by cheap wine, with another shot of whiskey closing the deal. He made it in time -- in time to watch me follow their example, except for the fact that I never needed to leave the table.Unlike what some folks have said, I believe Jimmy's has great bartenders. Back in those same years, a couple of guys had invited themselves over to the table my friend were sharing. After a while they were no longer charming and delightful, or at all cute and funny -- and they were very intimidating. One of the bartenders who knew us had evidently been keeping an eye on us. He quietly came out from behind the bar, nodded at the gentlemen at our table as he pulled up a chair next to me, and pulling me just a little close as he put his arm around my shoulder, he leaned towards them and almost in a whisper said: \"This is my wife you are sitting with. Please be careful what you say to her. You see, she is pregnant with our first child.\" I don't know what direction they went because they were now somewhere in another world.Jimmy's is a neighborhood place where all are welcome, as long as they are neighborly. I have enjoyed the company classmates, people I grew up with, as well as folks like Rev. Dr. Joseph Sittler, Dr. Mercia Eliade, and so many other well known scholars there. The U. of C. Provost used to take his little boys there after church while their mother was in choir rehearsal. That was so way back when that he recently retired as the president of Carthage College, and those two young men are long out of the nest. On a Sunday morning you were also likely to run into two elderly ladies from Sweden, who were also members of the church, and are now enjoying all the lutefisk they want in paradise.Yes, you also go to Jimmy's for beer, and the rule is the professor you are with always buys the first round Most of us are attracted to the place because of the great company you will share. \u00a0...but let's not forget the food! The Reuben sandwich is still just as good as it was 40+ years ago, as well as the fries, the burgers, and grilled cheese sandwiches. For me it is still the family bar, and when my siblings come to visit from the west coast and east coast, one of the things under the must column of the to do list is to visit Jimmy's. Even so, things change. I took my daughter down to Hyde Park for a hearing on the situation between Palestine and Israel, and being a good mother, it was a \"must\" that I take her to the family bar, especially since a good Reuben is her favorite sandwich. It being the middle of a Saturday afternoon, the bar was empty. The one lone bartender kept staring at us. I figured he wanted to make sure my then under aged daughter would not be drinking. We ordered Reubens and coke. He stared. We talked seriously and we laughed. He stared. I asked about the new owners, who had been my classmates in grammar school. He stared. We left and it wasn't until we were almost back in Oak Park that I finally figured out why he was staring at us. Because the event we had gone to Hyde Park to attend was interfaith, I was wearing my clerical shirt. He must have been wondering why a pastor would bring her daughter into a bar. I guess because a lot of other pastors in clerical collars knew where to find a good sandwich and a cold one, and I was just following their good example, because they had taught me well.

The stylist I went to after frequenting both salons told me that he's done a few former clients of Yehia and their hair showed the same signs that mine did. The problem is the combination of too hot blow dryers (one time at Max's the dryer was so hot it burned my scalp), wet hair and bristle brushes do not mix.

For drinks he suggested the daiquiri and the sake Kikusui. The daiquiri is actually called the \"citrus booze soda\" on the menu, but according to Isaiah, that is a totally unsexy name so they call it the Daiquri. It is a refreshing and citrusy, not to sweet.

The raw lotus roots definitely very interesting, I usually like them cooked, and this is the first time I had them raw. A good thing to try though some people may not like the slightly chalky texture of the raw lotus.Pork Belly Bun - braised pork belly with cucumber garnish on a steamed bun. Isaiah recommended this one and it definitely was quite tasty. The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and the tartness of the cucumber complemented the richness of the pork belly well.Vegetable ramen and Poser Ramen - The broths were flavorful and the noodles were al dente.

Prices are WAY too high for the quality of food.

Service was friendly, but some of the appetizers came out way after the entrees, as if the kitchen were running behind.My food impressions in detail:The loaded fries had a tasty sauce but quite greasy and a little floppy, perhaps oil not hot enough for that perfect crisp. Eggplant skewers were also tasty but nothing special, kind of greasy. The tofu buns seem like the best veggie item on the menu. Ramen, on the other hand, mostly just tasted salty, lacking that special umami (maybe needs more mushroom richness?). I adore pickles, but I was even disappointed with those -- they tasted only like pure rice vinegar, no other nuance to the brine. And the entree I ordered, Yusho bop, was my biggest disappointment. The thing I usually love about bi-bim-bop is the amazing variety of flavors and textures, with several kinds of pickles and vegetables and sauces all in the same bowl. The Yusho bop only contains rice, a couple pickles, a few mushrooms here and there, ONE sauce, and a fancy-shmancy-60-minute-egg that had a weird sticky texture -- the very thing that makes it fancy also prevents the yolk from running over the rice, the best part of bi-bim-bop!So in short: the menu is over-thought and overpriced, fancy just for its own sake, without a careful attention to the actual flavors of the food.THAT SAID, the beer selection is great and reasonably priced.

To begin, the food is very good. We have returned and even ordered take-out several times because we really do love the food. I think the beer list is decent, given the size of the food menu and restaurant. The service is such a disappointment. Two months ago, we went in on a Friday evening. It was relatively busy, but not \"swamped\". We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our entrees. As we sat there, it took about 15 minutes for our beers to come to the table. I can forgive this and we continued to wait for our appetizer. As we waited, we saw our specific appetizer being brought to tables around us that has just been seated. Several times we expected our appetizer and it never came. In fact, a table that arrived after we ordered, finished their food and left before any food was brought to our table. At this point we finally spoke to our server and he made excuses about how busy the kitchen was at that time. This was not a genuine or truthful explanation. After nearly an hour at the restaurant, our food finally arrived. We spoke with a manager who helped make the remainder of our time there acceptable. Although we were clearly frustrated when we left, we decided to return a few weeks ago because we love the food and an out-of-town guest wanted to eat there. I gave Yusho the benefit of the doubt that our previous experience was a fluke. Boy was I completely wrong. Not only did the exactly same situation happen, but it was even more disappointing this time. It took almost 20 minutes for anyone to address us. We sat at a table and waited. And waited. And waited. The explanation was that no one knew who was supposed to take our table. OK. Terrible customer service. Again, food took forever to come out. The manager seemed to care, but also wasn't completely put out that we had once again had a negative experience. Due to these nearly identical experiences, we will not be returning to Yusho anytime soon. Which is a shame because the food is worthy of the visit. In addition, we truly value supporting Hyde Park establishments.

The pickles they dropped off for making us wait so long were actually a highlight. Not sure how much they normally cost, but likely worth ordering for the wait.

It was fine an all, but just didn't pack that fun ramen broth flavor and there weren't quite enough of those cucumbers in it either for me. We also got a fried oyster steamed bun and a fried chicken steamed bun and they were both also just so so as well--although if I picked a winner it would have been the oyster one, but at $7 a piece these things are not that big. I think for $1 more this place could probably afford to serve two to make it not so awkward to share at a table. We also got the squash fried fritters that were pretty sweet in taste with some chunks of eel and stuff and I think this was probably the best part of the meal other than the crispy pork and what can really beat crispy pork??

This sandwich is deliciousness. The roasted tomato is so flavor-packed, it goes perfectly with the exceptionally fresh mozzarella and basil. I love to get this sandwich, especially on hotter days, because it's so refreshing and delicious!The Kristen - notttt in love with this one. The chicken salad was watery and the chunks of chicken were too large for the flimsy whole wheat bread. \u00a0It fell apart as soon as I took a bite and the taste wasn't super enjoyable.Lil' smoky & o'Malley - a delicious part of the Z&H menu, I love the tasty, unusual flavors and how they combine in this sandwich. The turkey meat is flaky and juicy. \u00a0The Brie mixes with it perfectly and the tomato chutney is a creative addition.The Marty - I'm a big fan of this vegetarian-friendly, comfort-food sandwich. \u00a0The eggplant is great - juicy, not too greasy (it's hard to cook eggplant without making it watery or greasy!). \u00a0Muhammara is the greatest topping in the world and I would never have thought to pair it with eggplant, but it goes perfectly. \u00a0Soft, sweet muenster cheese goes perfectly. \u00a0A Little Pecorino - this is arguably Z&H's number one sandwich and almost definitely the most popular one sold there. \u00a0I can't say much other than that the flavor of this sandwich is exceptional, and if you can only go to Z&H once, this is the thing to try.Pig on a Pretzel - the smoky ham, Swiss, pickle, and mustard go SO well together, tied together perfectly with a pretzel roll, aka the greatest kind of sandwich bread that exists.Old major - an old standby. Is there anything bad about goat cheese? No. Is there any way to improve it? I didn't think so until I tried it with tomato, Muhammara, and curried mayo. \u00a0God yes.90 miles to mosak - pulled pork and slaw are one of the greatest food combos in existence, and Z&H manages to do its usual incredible/ creative magic with sandwiches and improve that combo with a slew of fun ingredients.The Daley Dip - thick, crusty French bread + delicious jus. \u00a0Chicago winter food at its finest.Part 2: saladsFishy - I tend to sub the lemon dressing for balsamic vinegar, but otherwise this is a great salad. \u00a0Smoked salmon and salad? PerfectDucky - the goat cheese/grapes/duck breast combo is PHENOMENAL. \u00a0I would never have put duck on a salad. \u00a0Turns out it's the perfect protein for a salad.Left at Laos - I'm a big fan of peanut dressing usually, but this salad is a little boring tbh. Nothing special.Part 3: specialty nightsTaco night - Fridays and Saturdays Z&H throws down late for a delicious taco night. \u00a0Weirdly enough, the best one is absolutely the sweet potato and seitan taco. \u00a0Also a big fan of the beef one, but pulled pork is just eh. \u00a0I seriously love getting the kale bowl with sweet potato and seitan, but I wish they'd put the dressing on the side because they tend to seriously overdressGrilled cheese night - beyond delicious. \u00a0The creamiest grilled cheese you will ever consume........The service itself is okay. \u00a0The people who work at Z&H are the BEST. \u00a0They will become your friends, they will recognize you, they will make you happy. \u00a0But also sometimes your tacos will take 40 minutes to come or you'll get a sandwich with only bread and pesto and mayo on it (missing the turkey and veggies) because they forgot. \u00a0Things can take a while.
