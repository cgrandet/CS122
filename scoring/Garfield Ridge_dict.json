If your curiosity gets the best of you and you do decide to eat here and try a beef (with cheese) I would suggest telling them to put the cheese they use for the fries on the sandwich, it seemed like it would have tasted so much better and resolved some of the dryness issues.

After seeing some Vienna Beef signage I decided to stop in here and give the hot dog a try. One of the first things I noticed was that they serve Green River soda. I ordered two hot dog and fries special, splitting one for myself and one for my friend, a green river and waited patiently for my order to be ready. A few minutes later the food was out and I took my seat. One of the first things I noticed about this hot dog was the excessive condiment application. The pickle on this hot dog was easily as thick as the sausage itself. the tomato slices were huge as well, the mustard and relish were applied a little too generously. There were also two huge cucumber slices on this dog, and two fairly large sport peppers.The onions were well chopped and well applied, but the overall combination left me with a somewhat soggy bun due to all the juice from all the condiments and toppings. The bun itself was a non-poppy seed bun. The star of the show here was a perfectly heated natural casing frank. While the texture of this hot dog was soggy and messy, and had a difficult to bite through giant pickle on it. The excessive pickle size forced me to take the pickle off to enjoy the hot dog. Once I did this, the overall taste of the hot dog was excellent, even if it was falling apart. While not the messiest hot dog I've ever seen, or the biggest pickle spear I've ever seen, these two elements really brought down the score on this dog. The fries included were thick and had a hard not particularly soft or flavorful potato paste on the inside. They were fairly salty but overall my all of my qualifications for a very quick trip to the trash after having sampled only a few of them. I'd recommend skipping the fries here.Overall this was a hot dog that was soggy, and difficult to hold. It had a pickle larger than the dog itself, but the quality of the sausage used and overall good ingredients spared it from being a total disaster to an average hot dog. I'd say if one were to order this with no pickle spear, you might be in luck and get an excellent tasting hot dog. I'd say this place is average, though the hot dog here was a mess, it actually wound up tasting surprisingly good for how off the assembly of it was. I'll give it three stars.", "rating": "3"}, "8": {"date": [2013, 6, 4], "description": "I'm from Chicago but I've lived in Los Angeles for about 2 years now. Whenever I come into town there is a short list of foods I have to eat and one of those things is an Italian beef sandwich. I suppose you can find one in LA, but you'd have to look long and hard to get one that's truly Chicago style. Anywho, I took my boyfriend here because my parents like Beefy's and also they accept credit cards (side note, never really realized how many restaurants and bars in Chi-town are cash only, totally annoying). I remember as a kid liking their homemade soups and their fries also. Just as I remembered, the soup was really great (Cream of Chicken with Rice), mmmmm! It could have used a little more rice and chicken though, but all in all I was happy. Next was the Italian beef, which we both got \"wet\" or \"dipped.\" \u00a0The monsters came out to greet us, mine on French bread and the bf's on garlic bread. Holy moly I don't remember these sandwiches being this huge! They were juicy and delicious and definitely hit the spot. In my boyfriend's own words, \"It should be illegal to serve food like this.\" Not that he didn't like it, but these mounds of beef, bread and peppers have to be approximately 2000 calories each. We both hated ourselves a little after eating about half and wanting more. We felt so fat and shameful.Beefy's is delicious, but almost in a negative way. It's hate-yourself-shameful.

When i saw this one opening i was excited. I had been to a few different locations and each time i was amazed at the quality of the veggies used. i'm a big fan of 'garbage' pizzas or the works or however you wish to call it so Beggar's was naturally the place for me. So needless to say i was excited to see this location opening soon since now i wouldn't need to drive 30 minutes to one of their locations. \u00a0I must say that just about all the previous reviews were spot on. Although i bought carryout so i can not comment on table service i will comment on everything else. When i called in my order, there was a lack luster answer in which the person did not identify themselves and seemed to be bothered by having to answer the phone. I bring these things up only because i believe the employee should identify themselves just as they do when they wait on you at the table. It brings a more professional feel to things i believe. The not so spunky attitude is subjective i suppose so i won't comment too much on it other than to say it wasn't very good. So i arrived to pick up the deep dish about 32 minutes after my order. i checked this on the timer on my phone so i'm sure that number is exact. even counted from the end of the call. i was told it would be 30 minutes. it turned out to be 55 minutes. The young girl at the register was very nice, she handled her job pretty well. my issue with the people behind the register is that they were dressed sloppy. Shirts untucked, and a few sagging pants. So the appearance of the employees was not very impressive. So after all that wait i got my expensive pizza home and i thought it would be worth the wait but i was let down. the veggies were cut thick as promised and everything looked the part so i was so sure that i was going to get exactly what i expected. i took my first anticipated bite and just when i was about to call God's name, i was rushed with a taste of blan. It was missing the IT factor that i thought was so good from all my other experiences. This pizza needed something. Maybe it was the sauce that tasted as if it came from a can (i'm sure all locations use sauce from a can) which was odd for beggars. The sauce has always tasted homemade for me. The veggies were thick but tasted a bit under cooked which is odd seeing how it was 20 minutes late to come out. Don't get me wrong i didn't hate the pizza because its almost impossible to get absolutely terrible pizza, but this one did not hold a flashlight to any of the others i had tried from Beggar's. At the end i was left disappointed and then i started getting upset so i decided to wait a few days before writing the review. I don't think i will ever return to this location and honestly i might take a break from Beggars for some time. i need to experience washed from my mind so i don't purposely find something wrong with the others.

The cheese sauce was a bit bland and lightly watery.Pizza (Half Pepperoni and Half Sausage, Mushroom and Onions) - I had one slice of the pepperoni and thought it tasted mostly like a cheese pizza. The other half was piled high with toppings. I really like the crust as it was crispy, but thought the pizza was bland. Need some zest to it. I don't think I'm a big fan of the massive topping overload with the cheese on top. It's hard to eat as most of the toppings keep falling off. Service was ok. Our waiter was nice and courteous. Only thing was when we paid the bill, he was taking forever. So my guy went up to see what was going on as there was only one other table there at the time.

The inside is even better. high ceilings, many TVs, well lit, clean, high tables and booths.We find a booth and sit. Waitress comes shortly and she was super nice and attentive. She informed us about some locally brewed beers that I had never heard of before and even brought us a small flight of 4 different beer so we could try them.I ended up having a southwest burger and one of the beers she recommended.

I was so exited I finally had convinced my husband to try it, so we came in today. At first, the small place exceeded my expectations. I told the waitress, a tall white female, that it was our first time at the restaurant. I'm sure she could see my excitement, I asked for her recommendations and she was simply nice. We placed our order shortly after and when we realized the final price we were a little shocked, $45 for a meal of two. I asked another waitress, shorter young Hispanic girl, why it was so high? She explained the orange chicken was suppose to be shared (never explained on the menu!), I kindly asked her to hold on the order while my husband chose another plate. I even explained to her it was again our first time, and that I was sorry for being such a \"newbie\". When we got back to order, literally 2 min after, the otee White woman simply told me that the order I had asked to hold on to and not placed was already prepared! Being nice and having worked in the hospitality industry for over 6 years, was trying to be less complicated and suggested just adding the 2 ingredients to the already prepared dish to make it what my husband wanted. I figured this was a semi-fair since I felt obligated in a way to purchase the already prepared rice and I wanted my husband to enjoy his first meal at this restaurant. The White lazy came back and said that was ok BUT AT $2 UP CHARGE PER ITEM TO MAKE THIS?! At this point I realized they were practically giving me to buy something I originally said I didn't want and then trying to over charge me for their lack of communication. Given its such a small space this should be a problem. It's seriously very disappointing that we couldn't try the food due to their lack of costumer service!

By all accounts the food was excellent, however in my opinion having a 5 star rated Thai restaurant should mean that not only is the food excellent, but the service, environment and overall experience are top notch as well. So, my wife and I were staying at a nearby hotel because we had an early morning flight to catch back to Dallas. Our only options within walking distance were TGI Fridays, a sandwich shop, pizza and Chinese takeout. I said, why not look on Yelp to see if we can find a place that'll deliver? We found Bree Thai and wow look at all the 5 star reviews! So my wife called and the guy (who sounded very hurried but friendly) said there would be an hour wait for delivery and told us where to find their menu online. Because the delivery wait was so long but the reviews were so favorable, why not just call for an Uber car and get the whole in-dining experience?? BAD IDEA! We arrive at the restaurant 20 minutes later, and saw from the street that the place sat only about 15 people max and someone apparently booked a private party while another 10 people were waiting for take out. The place was packed to the brim. As soon as we walked in, we were told that the dining room was closed and that we could only get takeout. Mind you our Uber car was long gone by this point. The owner didn't seem all too sympathetic to the fact that we just paid $8 to catch a ride to their restaurant and now all we could do is order takeout and pay to ride back even though the private party was ending and tables were freeing up. I say this all because I wish I had known that this place was the size of a shoe box and is nothing close to providing an authentic Thai food EXPERIENCE (at least one that I'm used to and I love going to Thai restaurants). If you're in the area and don't mind takeout, you'll love the food. It was truly excellent. But, if you're like me and prefer a sit down Thai food experience, stay clear of this place. You'll only be disappointed. From one business owner to another: You're onto something, but you're limiting your potential in a huge way. You have an awesome product, but your place is way too small, ugly and in a bad location.

Verbal offers made over the phone are always contingent upon inspection, and sometimes must be renegotiated if the coin is far below par, or retracted if the seller seems below board. \u00a0There is a different sheet, called the \"blue sheet\" that is for sight-unseen offers. \u00a0It could have been used safely in that situation, because it is MUCH lower. \u00a0Adjusting an in-person offer by 10% from a sight-unseen estimate is ethical, and paying 90% of grey sheet for a VF30 cent is more than generous. \u00a0Coin dealers do this sort of offer so frequently, that it is easy to forget to articulate all of the contingencies that are often just understood. \u00a0It is disappointing to get a little less than anticipated for a coin, but rejecting a completely fair offer is on the seller.Also, many customers use the word \"appraisal\" interchangeably with \"offer\". \u00a0It is sometimes a little difficult to tell which a customer really wants. \u00a0Spending time evaluating low-value coins for a customer free of charge can be a source of frustration for coin dealers. \u00a0There are many coins that the public refers to as \"silver dollars\" or \"gold dollars\" that are neither silver nor gold. \u00a0If you can go to the bank and get it at face value, it doesn't contain any precious metal. \u00a0If you are offered $1.10 each for \"silver dollars\" at Chicago Coin Co., then they aren't silver! \u00a0I don't even buy those, because I can only get $1.18 each if I mail hundreds of them out to a wholesale buyer!", "rating": "5"}, "2": {"date": [2014, 3, 19], "description": "I have bought lots of gold and silver in the last 3 year from these guys and their prices are always the best.

I was very happy that this wasn't the experience I had at the El Patron food truck. \u00a0I did get the \"special\", so perhaps that was why it was less expensive. Just a heads up.This time around I ordered the Taco special. So for approximately $7 I received 3 tacos, consisting of one steak, one pork, and one chicken, although you can get those 3 in any combination you choose. I also got a small side of received beans and Spanish rice.My opinion is that all 3 tacos were very tasty. The chicken and pork seemed to be marinated in a sauce. The steak was very well seasoned so that all three tacos could be eaten as is without adding sauce and still remaining flavorful. \u00a0The rice and beans, which in my opinion are a staple of any Mexican meal, were good, not great, but definitely enchanted the quality of my meal.On a previous occasion I ordered a steak burrito that I felt was equally good. \u00a0Again I can't say this is the best Mexican food you'll get in the city, but I can definitely recommend the El Patron food truck.", "rating": "4"}, "1": {"date": [2015, 9, 28], "description": "This is a review of the food truck that the restaurant operates.I had the burrito al pastor and elote.

When I explained to the person that I really wanted forgotten item to be BROUGHT to me (I know, a novel concept when ordering takeout), I was told that they were too busy and the best they could offer would be to credit item's amount to me when ordering next time. Are you kidding me? Needless to say, I told them where they could go, and crossed their number off my takeout phonelist.

Hopefully the people that opened this place haven't burned any bridges with their previous employers, because I get the feeling that before too long, they may have need to go crawling back to their old jobs.

First of all, I walked in at 9:30pm, thinking this placed closed at 1am. Our server rushed us to order & so I asked what time she closed. She answered saying 10pm, so I said needed a few minutes. Had she said 9:30, I would have rushed my order because I understand that they are closing. She came back in about one min tops. We repeated our order to her a few times as she rolled her eyes because she repeated it back wrong. When I asked what came on the torta she rudely pointed at the menu where it said, which I obviously hadn't seen. I told her I'd be ordering something to go as well. She never brought us chips or salsa. When she finally came back around to bring our food I figured I would ask for everything I needed so I wouldn't have to bother her again. I placed my to go order and asked for chips & salsa. She rudely walked away & it was a few minutes before she brought out salsa, so no one started eating yet. We had to waive her down to get her to bring it to us, mind you we were the only group there and we were only 3! She gave us such an attitude when she dropped it off and I asked for limes that I had to ask, \" I'm sorry, are we bothering you?\" She said no & then as she walked away said she couldn't wait to get out of there! Many people tried to come in as we were sitting there & she rudely yelled out, \"we are closed.\" \u00a0When she brought my limes she asked if there was anything else, again with such a disgusting attitude. Maybe, had she not rushed us to order or ran away so fast after we asked for something, we wouldn't have to keep asking. I'm sure the people trying to come in probably thought this place closed later. I've heard from multiple friends that they are open late & on yelp it says they are open until 1am today. After finishing eating at 10pm now, we sat & talked as we patiently waited for her to come check on us so we could ask for the bill. She was busy cleaning up & kicking people out that came to the door. She lost a lot business, I can tell you that. She then came up and said, \" We are closed now.\" I told her that we were ready and she was welcome to bring the bill. She walked away, went to the register & again with an attitude yelled out, \" actually your supposed to pay up here.\" How am i supposed to know that? I've never been there, nor is the register far from our table. So we walked up & I told her there was no reason to be rude, then asked for my to go order & she pointed to a counter where it was sitting. No answer, just a point, like i was supposed to already know where she put it. I handed her a hundred dollar bill and she said they didn't take hundreds! I then asked her not to speak to me with an attitude & then she said, \" no you don't \u00a0talk to me that way.\" I'm sorry, how am i supposed to know you don't take hundreds! And if you don't, that's fine, but is it necessary to throw it back at me? The food here was pretty decent, but with service like this, it's no wonder they don't have the best reviews. I asked for her managers name and she said they weren't there, which wasn't what I asked but OK. I won't be coming back here or recommending this place to anyone. It really doesn't feel good to feel like your being rushed while your eating. Nor feel like you are bothering your server, or have the door slammed as she lets you out. I'd gladly get up and get my own food to not inconvenience someone, unfortunately that's not the way the restaurant is set up, so I had no choice but to count on her.", "rating": "2"}, "56": {"date": [2012, 6, 21], "description": "This place was horrible & no wonder why it was empty!

He would have given it five stars except he believes that there is always room for improvement. I would give it three or four stars.It's really got an unassuming exterior, but is cleverly decorated with a decoupage of antiquated Mexican cowboy images. The tables and chairs felt rather rustic, but were sturdy. There were two or three flat screen TVs tuned to the news. I loved the big windows and natural light.We sat ourselves at a table near the wall. It was badly in need of a good wipe-down. Our server didn't move to wipe it down when she brought our chips and salsas. The salsas came in catchup-like bottles. There were no plates for the chips and salsa so we squirted each individual chip with salsa before eating it. I thought the arrangement was unconventional AND bothersome. Scott thought it was clever. Agree to disagree?There wasn't much variety of food. Scott scanned the menu for enchiladas and was disappointed. He even went as far as to ask the server (who he probably would have given a five on a five-point scale) and remained disappointed. Next he asked about margaritas... Nope. For a place that's open so late at night you'd expect them to have alcohol.The server explained that the restaurant is working on getting a liquor license; however, she won't be able to work there once they do (under age). Even though my buddy had a hankering for a margarita, I think he'd rather keep that server. Personally, I think she would probably get a two star rating based on her serving skills.We both got taco dinners. They seemed very basic to me. Scott said that they were authentic and reminded him of when he was building houses in Mexico. I liked them a lot and ate everything on my plate.Our server didn't check on us again after serving our food. Even Scott's longing glances at her back didn't bring her back to our table. Eventually he got up to ask about dessert (there are no desserts) and he paid with her at the counter. We're still not sure if that was the customary routine or if she was supposed to bring us our bill.In conclusion, we'll go back for the food. It seems to be the best Mexican in the area. It also has nice decorations. I say get a better server and a liquor license.

Plus this was literally the ONLY place open nearby with food and I was ready to eat my own arm from hunger, so I instructed my man to pull the car over and park.I set my mind on eating for sustenance and expected a not-so-tasty meal but I was pleasantly surprised. We had the appetizer quesadilla which was non-greasy and tasted like something my mom would've made me as a kid... which I totally dug. It was two, small (about 4 inches in diameter) quesadillas, cut into 4 pieces each and served with a tiny helping of mexican rice and some sour cream. I tested out their salsas, both of which were delicious. They came in big, cold squeeze bottles. One was a mild, green salsa that was extremely flavorful and the other a nice spicy red salsa (The chips are store bought. They're not stale, they're just not amazing).I had carne asada tacos and my husband had the carne asada torta. All were delicious. Tacos were served on corn tortillas with cilantro and onion and the sandwich was served on extremely fresh and soft bread with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.

I hope the owner or manager reads these - I have been here about five or six times and every time I've had the same server and she brings the overall experience down a lot. One time I walked in, ordered to go and after three separate people came and went for to go orders after me I finally reminded her I had only a chicken burrito and had been waiting over ten minutes. She kind of absentmindedly just walked away without saying anything but I knew she was going to check on it. She came back immediately with it but still never once acknowledged that it took so long and that rubbed me the wrong way. Today I ordered my usual (chicken burrito no sour cream) as I sat outside. It had a lot cream on it so I went in to tell her. She was in the middle of taking a to go order from a woman... She ignored the woman who I swear was mid sentence literally speaking her order to ask me what was wrong. So I told her and she went to the kitchen leaving me and the woman looking at each other.. We had a chuckle because it was so abrupt and unprofessional it seemed surreal. When she brought me the corrected order I looked at her and said \"thank you\" - she was either mad or entirely disengaged because she was looking right at me when I said it but she just turned around and walked back inside. Here's the weird part, I honestly don't think she was upset I just think she is oblivious to proper etiquette in a customer service type of job. Other issues from past visits involve small things.. Asking for napkins and water but her forgetting on different occasions. My first go to order is a good example. I asked if she could include one red and one green salsa. She said it always comes with one of each. I swear I got home and had zero salsa lol. I actually called back to complain that time BV I was a little fired up.

Dining experience on 12/31/2015, early evening.The service: To start, the staff was super disorganized. I stood in line, but somehow ended up getting bypassed by multiple people behind me. Then at the register, the guy took my order, swiped my credit card, then went along to completely ignore me. Then 10 min later, he had to ask me again what I ordered then subsequently said that I paid for just the hot dog and not the combo. When I said otherwise, he asked me for my receipt (which he never gave me). Then he gracefully shuffled through the pile of receipts, which apparently he didn't bother to give to customers, and randomly picked out one, pointed at it, and asked me again to pay more. At this point, I had to shuffle through the pile myself and pull out one with my credit card info on it, showing the correct amount. Still not satisfied, he demanded that I show him my credit as proof, which I glad did. I even showed him my phone which showed my transactions. Having provided two forms of identification, he finally gave up and let me go with my food. Phew... I got through airport security faster than this line.The food: the hot dog looked like it was passed through a flame thrower. It was charcoal black and burnt to a crisp. It had been sitting on top of a mountain of his charred brethren for who knows how long. The bread was freshly pulled out from a plastic bag, cold and just so so. The only saving grace was the Martian green relish, which I got oh so little of. The fries were crispy but stale and under seasoned.I know, I know.

I've never known a hot dog place to offer that, and honestly, that was the sole reason we decided to order from here. Our order consisted of 2 polish, a cheeseburger, fries, and an order of mozzarella sticks. I had a polish and it was literally the best I've ever had. I don't know if it's the way they cook them, if they've discovered the perfect amount of onion, relish, mustard, and pickle, or what. It was just plain good. Same goes for the sticks. I love me some good cheese sticks and these do the trick. Last but not least, this place has some pretty good customer service. Imagine my surprise when I bit into one of the mozzarella sticks and found it completely void of any mozzarella. What?! However, it was only one and I wasn't going to go nuts and make a huge deal out of it. It happens. My friend wanted to call and just let them know, in case it was a bad batch, etc. They apologized and offered us a free order of mozzarella sticks. He told me and my jaw dropped. He didn't yell or complain or throw around that horrible line everyone loves to use (\"Well I won't be coming here anymore\"). Mistakes happen. Point is, I was surprised and super grateful. So, H.

Many a street was passed until on our left we saw H Dog Fast Food. We pulled into the parking lot, got out of the car and headed in. When you walk through the doors there's one big area to order with the kitchen behind it, a small hall on the side and on the opposite side the dining area. The dining area seems like it was addition to this building as it just doesn't match the rest of the inside.We went in and placed our order for a hot dog each and split some fries. A few minutes later our food was ready and it was time to dig in. The hot dog came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. On the positive side the bun was soft with no signs of dryness. The mustard and relish application was fine. There was a thick tomato slice on the hot dog and a nicely sliced, not too sour pickle on it as well. There were also quite a few sport peppers on it. The sausage used on this hot dog was a skinless hot dog, and I suspect a Red Hot Chicago brand one. The fries were thin fries very similar to McDonalds fries, they were a bit less salty, shorter, thinner and crispier but had a nearly identical taste. Quite a few hot dog places use this particular style of french fry which usually goes quite well with hot dogs as long as it isn't being cooked in some sort of strange grease. I'm happy to report that these fries were quite suitable and a nice compliment.My overall impression of H Dog Fast Food is that it's an above average place to obtain a Chicago style hot dog. While nothing exceptional both the dogs and fries were made well and were reasonably priced. While not worth going out of your way to visit. It's well worth stopping here to give it a try.

Another server behind us rattled off the beers on tap by memory. There are about 15 beers on top and he nailed all of them. The beer selection is excellent - everything from local Goose Island to small Cali microbrews. My smokehouse burger on pretzel bun was excellent. Chips were a little soggy but still tasty. My father in law announced it was \"the best burger I've ever eaten.\" That's saying a lot. Toasted raviolis were crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. Perfect. Chicago Beef sandwich is served in a bread bowl and was equally tasty to the burgers. Beers were cold, water was kept full, and the check was manageable for four adults and a child.

I have always been a fan of HRI and will continue to frequent the other locations. \u00a0But I had to write a review based on the offensively bad service that we received at this location.I went out with some family for some pizza. \u00a0They were just returning from vacation, so called ahead to have the pizzas ready. \u00a0We ordered two large sausage pizzas. \u00a0Very easy, straightforward order. \u00a0After an hour of waiting for them, our server brought us one pizza. \u00a0She then explained which half had jalapenos on it. \u00a0It was obviously not our order. \u00a0Rather frustrating after calling ahead and still waiting an hour. \u00a0We told the server that this was incorrect order. \u00a0She disappeared. \u00a0Five minutes later, the general manager showed up. \u00a0The manager took on a very defensive tone and asked we wanted him start making our correct order. \u00a0He made no apologies or attempts to rectify the situation. \u00a0Normally, I'd expect at least an apology and maybe an offer of an appetizer or a refill on drinks or something...anything. \u00a0Instead, I stopped the manager when he stated that he was sorry the WE made the mistake. Once I insisted that this was their mistake, he quickly backpedaled. \u00a0He maintained a tone of almost annoyance that we insisted that this was their mistake and not ours. \u00a0 I was amazed at the lack of ownership he was willing to take for the poor service. \u00a0 If an error is made, you don't automatically assume it was the fault of the customer. \u00a0He agreed to put in the correct order. \u00a0A few minutes later, the server asked if we would like some bread and crackers while we waited for the new pizzas. \u00a0This seemed like an odd, but genuine gesture to reconcile. \u00a0Then the server brought out two pieces of bread and two small packets of oyster crackers for 4 people. \u00a0I sat there dumbfounded. \u00a0After another 20 minutes had passed, I sought out another manager. \u00a0She was rushed and kept cutting me off while I was talking. \u00a0It felt as though I was just \"being handled\" rather than genuinely cared for by the staff and the management. \u00a0As I was talking to her, the pizzas arrived. \u00a0One of them burnt. \u00a0The first manager came over and offered to take one of the pizzas off of the bill. \u00a0We were not looking for handouts or freebies. \u00a0I just wanted someone...anyone to maturely take responsibility for the poor service. \u00a0The server almost seemed to be hiding from our table for the rest of the meal. \u00a0We had to ask a bus boy for refills. \u00a0Even the table next to us seemed to be losing their patience , as well. \u00a0I could understand this treatment if we were being rude or making a scene. \u00a0That wasn't the case. \u00a0I've never been so disappointed in Home Run Inn. \u00a0Our family has been going to the 31st street location for many, many years. \u00a0Very disappointed in this trip.", "rating": "1"}, "47": {"date": [2012, 9, 22], "description": "I've lived in garfield ridge now for ten years (my family much longer) and this is my first neighborhood review! \u00a0As far as pizza goes..thank god the Home Run Inn family opened up this location on archer avenue. \u00a0Consistency is the most important thing in a pizza joint. \u00a0A classic chicago buttery crust that sizes between a thin and deep dish style. \u00a0Not too much cheese and fresh vegetables are vital. \u00a0The sauce is solid with a nice spice to sweet ratio. \u00a0My favorite pizzas are the Hawaiian and sausage with mushrooms. \u00a0The bar seating is perfect for having a pie while catching up on a Sox, Hawks or Bulls game. \u00a0I wish they delivered but their frozen pizzas are always a great standby and the best in Chicago. \u00a0I've eaten at this location nearly \u00a0a dozen times and their consistent pizzas have won me over. \u00a0If your in the neighborhood it's the best around. \u00a0They expanded their menu options out of pizza land but I haven't ventured into that territory yet, I'll keep ya posted.", "rating": "4"}, "48": {"date": [2012, 8, 7], "description": "I tried Home Run for the first time last week. \u00a0 As a Gino's East fan and a consumer of Giordano's in the past I wasn't sure if this would be a good choice. \u00a0 I was totally surprised.

To start off, we got an appetizer of a super platter and cheesy garlic bread. My super platter was chicken strips, cheese sticks, and super fries. I'm a big fan of cheese sticks, and Home Run Inn's cheese sticks are amazing! There is a great amount of bread and cheese, which are both great! The super fries were amazing. The fries looked fresh-cut, and they did taste like that. The cheese and bacon pieces tasted great on the fries. For my entree I had a personal pizza with beef, sausage, and pepperoni. It was delicious. The beef was tender, the sausage tasted good, and the pepperoni tasted good. All in all, great service, great food, good location, but it's pricy.

THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is how sausage on a pizza is supposed to taste. Fennel and other spices. Not a crazy amount of fat. I wish other pizza places could get this right.I had one of their Chicago's Best pizzas, with sausage, pepperoni, and bacon. I should have gone with just a sausage or maybe a sausage and mushroom pizza instead because the pepperoni and bacon made the one I got way too salty, and the bacon added an unpleasant slightly burnt flavor. Still, it was a decent pizza.

What is it with airport food? Airports either have no standards, or they do so much business due to a given captive audience of trapped hungry passengers, that they don't have to do anything to attract customers. However, at this particular airport, Midway in Chicago, there is the dreaded food court, so at the very least the competition should stir up some level of pride and standards to meet. Not so with this establishment. I walked up to the lighted menu sign posted on the outside of the restaurant wall and noted three things: the 1/3 pound baby burger was $5.59, there was a Caesar salad offering, and at the bottom it said \"Warning: this is not a fast food restaurant. All food is cooked fresh when you order. Relax and have a drink\". I started visualizing a hand tossed Caesar in a large bowl, freshly dressed, scooped onto a plate for my enjoyment. This image in my head made it difficult to choose between the baby burger, and the Caesar. I decided on the burger to save a few bucks. I went to the counter to place my order. I asked for the baby burger with a lettuce wrap. First I noticed that the laminated menu at the counter showed the baby burger's price at $5.99, 40 cents higher than the prominently displayed lit menu in a case on the wall. When I mentioned this, the comment back was dismissive. \"The price went up\". The proper way to handle THEIR MUSTAKE would be to honor the posted lower price. But this clerk wasn't interested in offering proper customer service as was demonstrated again (more obnoxiously) later...I was told that the lettuce was shredded and it costs an extra 25 cents. Preposterous! No bun! Just a few leaves of lettuce instead! Made no sense and coupled with the price ignorance, this ticked me off. I didn't want shredded lettuce. Hoping to salvage the situation of getting fed satisfactorily, I switched back to my vision of a fresh Caesar. Nope, not today. The clerk goes to the back and grabs for me a plastic box with shredded lettuce, shredded Parmesan and HORRORS! a pack of Newmans Own Caesar dressing. Yikes. The sight of this processed refrigerated excuse for a Ceasar salad was a complete and utter turn off. I couldn't help myself--I had to mention that they boast freshly cooked...and here is where the mannerless clerk interrupted me with this snark--\"do you want your Ceasar freshly cooked\"? She should be fired for that comment! I hope this gets back to her. I left in a huff. The story does have a decent ending though. I got passable good at Pegasus.

Both entrances and the other exit are locked with turned over baskets in front of the door. And the two time this happened to me there weren't signs on the entrances explaining that they were open and what the procedure was. More of a guessing game. Produce here is always fresh and the produce employees actively ask customers if they are finding everything OK. I don't usually buy deli goods here due to the high meat and cheese prices. I would rather go to FairPlay at 87th and Cicero or on 95th for that, where prices are really low and deli service is real solid. The bakery staff is very friendly. If they are out of something and you ask about it they go out of their way to assist and do it with a smile. The photo employees can sometimes be a bit rude and unwilling to assist customers having issues with photo orders.

The parking lot can be a nightmare, but that's the only negative thing I have to say about it. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was relatively empty. However, go on a Saturday or right before a holiday and you'll wish you just walked or took the bus because getting in and out of the lot will tie up traffic on Archer. Instead, go on a weekday, mid-morning or afternoon, or on a weekday evening and you can get in and out without any trouble.This is your typical mom and pop store. No fancy checkout lines or large aisles, but the selection here is great. 90% of their products are imported from Poland, which I really appreciate. However, a number of those products are written only in Polish, so ask an employee if you need help.The selection of grocery items seems to be pretty decent, and the produce is reasonably priced, but go to Good Earth Market further north on Archer for great produce!The deli counter is NOT to be missed, hear me? Everyone behind the counter speaks Polish and English, so you should be okay when ordering. However, if you get the rare employee who speaks only/mostly Polish, you can get your point across easily enough.The fresh meat counter is usually pretty open, and you can walk up and someone will help you right away. I find their chuck roasts to be reasonably priced and they are huuuuuuge! Do NOT walk away from the fresh Polish sausage!! It's so, so good and made fresh that day, if not right before you came in. If you see that a case is empty, don't assume they're out. Ask and they probably have it in the back and just haven't put anymore out.As far as the deli is concerned, definitely follow the advice of other Yelpers. Get a number and be on the lookout for it because it'll be called out in Polish and you'll get skipped if you're not paying attention.Long story short: this is old school Chicago Polish at its finest.

Other than that my experience was one of bitter disappointment.I ordered the regular combination (orange chicken and kung pao chicken for the main dishes and lo mein for the side) and was struck by several things.1) The sauce for the orange chicken tasted nothing like any other orange chicken sauce I have tried, and not in a good way. I didn't think it was possible to screw up that sauce, but apparently it is. It did not taste remotely like orange. It did not look remotely orange. It tasted like soy sauce that had been slightly thickened and then had a little ginger and maybe a squeeze of citrus added to it. The kung pao chicken sauce was a little better, but only marginally. 2) The chicken itself was dry and just tasted a little weird. I can't adequately describe it, but suffice it to say that it was not what I remember chicken tasting like. Almost gamey. It also looked like it was thin shavings of chicken rather than discrete chunks, although that it itself is not too bad.3) The lo mein was overcooked and mushy. This was actually the best part of the whole meal, and even then it wasn't enjoyable.I understand that there are regional differences in how foods are made (and therefore my expectations may have just been different from how it is prepared locally), and that I shouldn't necessarily expect 'quality' (however defined) at an airport fast food joint. Those points aside, this was the least satisfying food experience I have *ever* had at an airport. If I had read any of the other reviews or taken a close look at the food through the sneeze guard I probably would have gone somewhere else. Their management needs to check out similar restaurants to see how they prepare and serve similar products.One final note: I'm one of those people who cleans his plate at every meal because I hate to waste food (and because I like to get my money's worth) and this time I ended up throwing away over half of the orange chicken.

In my mind I wanted something light and fresh but when I saw that King Wah had nearly no wait I instantly caved. I expected the usual, overly fried, mushy, salty, oily goop over a bed of white rice. Instead, I got a steaming hot container of fresh, crisp vegetables with beef that was actually tender.

This place has gone from bad to worse in a few short years, and that's just sad.First of all, when you walk in, you're not really impressed with the cleanliness of the place. Shrimp Shack, on the other side of the street, is CLEAN. This place? I felt kinda dirty walking in.A giant menu greets you on the left side, and 1980s-era RC Cola freezer stands on the right, looking like it wants to be put out of its misery.Perch dinners used to be kick ass. Now they're terrible. They taste fishy, which isn't good. Kinda taste like they've been sitting out 5 minutes past. In a word, yuck.Shrimp are still decent, which is the reason this place gets 2 stars. You can't be a Korner Shrimp House and have crappy shrimp. But, they are coated in breading, so the size of the shrimp is skewed. You think you're getting a decent-sized meal until you realize that the shrimp are covered in breading and are half the size inside all that. Also, they charge by breaded weight, so you'll get 5-6 shrimp in a 1/4 lb. order, instead of what you'd get if they were honest and charged what's right.Prices are pretty high for the quality. $9 for 5 overly breaded and seasoned shrimp? Screw that. Their scallops are chewy. It's a little like eating rubber that's been coated in butter.Their sides are actually pretty decent. I'll still probably stop in for the hush puppies and coleslaw. Having good sides is kind of astounding given that they butcher their seafood.But still, the people come in.

It was pretty good actually and better than what I was expecting. My father's panini thought was disgusting. The chicken tasted as if it has been frozen for months before being served. The other ingredients, lettuce, tomato, onion, were all horrible as well. It was the driest panini I have ever tasted.The serve at this location was also abysmal. While ordering my father was asked if he wanted a water and replied \"No thank you.

The woman at the counter asked me what size I wanted. Not knowing that size choice was even an option I told her that \"small\" would be fine. It ended up being plenty. She filled a styrofoam clamshell box (the kind you fit sandwiches into) with spaghetti. It was warm and tasty, covered in a sweet (maybe a tad over-sweet?) red meat sauce. It was exactly what I was looking for and the portion was perfect. Oh and here's the kicker: The child-size spaghetti cost a whopping $3.89.

The onion roll was okay. Good firm texture and not dry. The cooked chopped onions on top were flavorless. Too overlooked and scattered like a bunch of roaches when the lights get turned on in a dark room when I took my first bite. Good thing I got a fork. The meat was pretty solid. I saw them cut the corned beef from the brisket. The pastrami came straight from a Saran wrapped pouch of meat that had been recently nuked. Both meats worked well together (how could it not?) and were juicy and flavorful. Complemented well by the deli mustard. Overall a good and filling sandwich. I got the regular. You could get the jumbo for $2 -$3 more and it gives you three more ounces of meat. The potato pancake was actually good in flavor but not good in all other respects. I don't profess to be a potato pancake expert but I've had must better. Biggest problem was it was just greasy. Very greasy. And it didn't help that the one I got had been squatting under a heat lamp for a while before it was served to me. A heat lamp that didn't put off much heat I might add. Thus, it was a lukewarm and greasy affair. But because I paid $2 for it I was a trooper and ate it in the name of getting value for my dollar. Don't do this to yourself. In the end, I'd come back and try another sandwich. Won't go for that side again. If you are in Midway and need a quick and hearty meal, this is better than the food court options there.

My first was really great. Nice job on a gel no chip refill. Second time, not so great. Sure it was a different nail tech, but still. Gel overlay was way too thick despite my frequents requests to keep it thin. I always scope out the place while im waiting or getting my nails done. I thought it was interesting that it appeared that they use the same tools on everybody. No immediate sanitation of the tools was observed. However, I thought maybe that was just me. The third time I went, I noticed a brown/green spot on my nail bed. They said it was because I needed a new full set and that I should do that my next time in. They ended up rushing me through as the salon got busier. I went home and did research. Found out that spot was a bacterial infection. Needless to say, I removed the gel overlay and treated the infection. Yep, gross! To make matters worse, I spoke with a coworker who also frequented the salon and stated she had an ongoing issue with one of her nails as well. The technicians minimized the severity of it. She ended up losing the entire nail and is in the process of it growing back. Yep. This place is a writhing cesspool of bacteria. Sorry, Man Trap!

I told him what happened and he started questioning me and claiming that he was not responsible for my nails breaking within hours of me getting them done. He then said that because I received a fill in from him, my original nails were to blame because he assumed I got them done somewhere else. When I told him that I only get my nails done at his salon he went back to blaming me. Mike is not a businessman, he's a crook.

Alas, I was randomly selected for pre-check and got through the security line with 3.5 hours to spare. My flight was at gate B2, which was close to a bunch of the other restaurants. I was craving McDonald's and saw on Yelp that Midway actually had one, but I didn't know which gate it was at. I called the McDonald's for which gate they were at, and they didn't know. I ended up finding out that it was near gate B10. I headed there.Once I was there, I remember that the other Yelp reviews warned that the line was long and service was slow; however, in my experience from entering the line to getting my food, the whole process took less than 6 minutes. Not too painful!I got the 20 piece chicken nuggets, which was about $8. This was pricier than I am used to (20 piece for $5 is the normal price). At this increased price point, I'd definitely recommend checking out one of the other restaurants near gates B1 (perhaps getting yourself an Italian beef or a Chicago hot dog). However, I was hungry and already made up my mind that I was getting McDonald's, so I paid anyway. I was about to pay using my credit card, but then I remembered McDonald's accepts ApplePay now. I swung out my phone and paid effortlessly.

The hot dogs came on regular non-poppy seed buns. The bun was kind of on the dry side and made me wonder if it was frozen, and perhaps microwaved to soften it up (that could be the sound we heard). A rather excessive amount of relish was applied to this hot dog. The onions were long onions, like those you might find on a sub sandwich, not at all surprising considering the word sub in the name of the restaurant. The mustard was also applied a little too liberally. There was no pickle or tomato on this hot dog, but there were quite a few sport peppers. The sausage used here was skinless and had an okay flavor in and of itself, but when mixed with the excessive relish, mustard, and dry bun led to an overall disappointing combination.Overall I've had much worse hot dogs, but also much much better.

If you like fried chicken, it's a must-try.But definitely remember that eating there isn't exactly what you want to do. The dining area is a bit shabby....just a handful of neon yellow booths. They were pretty clean...but probably because so few people actually eat-in. Most people carry-out, or opt for delivery...they deliver to a bar down the street. However, the bar was closed for July 4th weekend, which is when I went...so my DC and I had no choice but to park it in a yellow booth. But I think the lack of ambience can be somewhat overlooked, because everyone in Mini Hut was so friendly. One nice young fella tried to turn the radio on for us, but he couldn't get it to work. \u00a0This radio was probably 50 years older than he was....if he was ever able to turn it on, I am sure Little Orphan Annie would have entertained us as we inhaled our chicken.

But honestly-HONESTLY-it is totally worth the wait. I don't know what they do to this chicken, and quite frankly I don't even care. It is the most delicious, juicy fried chicken I've ever had in my life. They call it their \"famous butter-crust\" chicken, and it is so tender, so juicy, so damn crisp on the outside....it's amazing. The \"hut\" itself is completely without charm. Handful of tables that will probably be full when you get there. It is truly a grab n' go establishment. I usually get my chicken delivered, and it arrives hot and crispy every time in a cardboard box, all wrapped up in wax paper. Totally old school. Fries are crinkle cut, nothing special there. Their coleslaw is passable, and the rolls are Parker House-style. In all honesty, I haven't really looked at the menu much past the chicken because I'm borderline obsessed with it.

It's been a lengthy pursuit. The fried chicken chronicles have kept me busy.Ladies and gentlemen, the search is over.Nearly three years ago, I read a Yelp review of Mini Hut written by my friend Bob D., and I immediately bookmarked it. There it sat in my bookmarks forever, taunting me, and daring me to go. Therein lies the power of Yelp; if it weren't for Bob's review (and Adrian's review begat Bob's review), then I never, ever would have known about this place. I know no one that lives in Garfield Ridge (nor had I ever heard of Garfield Ridge) and had never seen this place mentioned anywhere else previously.As much as I adore fried chicken (which is a lot. A whole lot), I only allow myself to indulge in it about once a month. So I choose carefully. Oftentimes it involves intricate planning because a trip out of the city is usually required. For the trip to MH, I corralled the dude to go with me. He assumed we were going to last month's place (which was in Mundelein) so I had to set him straight that we were headed to the SW side of the city. His response was priceless: \"How many motherf8%^&#@* fried chicken shacks *are* there in the greater metro area?!\" In the end, he relented. He knows how happy fried chicken makes me.The drive wasn't all that bad; about thirty minutes in zero traffic. We walked in to an utterly charmless place and placed our order. We knew ahead of time that the chicken would take upwards of thirty minutes to cook and we took no issue with that. All good things come to those who wait, yo.We decided to eat our chicken in the bar across the street, as Mini Hut happily delivers. There was no way I was going to risk driving the chicken home and letting it steam and get soggy. We also entertained the idea of eating in the car but eating in the bar worked out just fine.We bellied up to the bar and waited. I was so excited that every time someone opened the door, I jumped out of my seat. In exactly thirty minutes, the man from MH walked in with a box so big, it could've held a sheet cake. The fried chicken dinner came with a mountain of crinkle-cut fries, some parker-house style rolls, and a huge cup of cole slaw. Since we were already going for broke, we had also ordered a side of onion rings and fried mushrooms.I can't even begin to describe how good the chicken was. It was flavorful all the way to the bone. Unbelievably juicy (even the breast) and perfectly seasoned. The skin was so crisp and succulent that I nearly wept with joy. The sides were all fine, if a little standard, but that chicken was downright ambrosial. If it's possible to get drunk off fried chicken, then I definitely was.I'm pretty sure there's other stuff on the menu (including a curiously-named tamale and chili cup christened the \"mother in law\") but if you go to Mini Hut and get anything else besides the chicken, then you're batshit crazy. It's all about the chicken.The owner and staff were so kind and friendly.

They must brine the living daylights out of the chicken, because it's deeeeeeelicious. Juicy and salty all the way through, even the white meat. And great seasoning with a light crispy batter. Maybe some of the best I've had, honestly. Their fries are tasty, with plenty of salt, scoring more points with me. My only complaint would be their coleslaw - it's a little over sweet and over dressed for me. It isn't cut with onion, just not dressed as I prefer. Also worth having are the fried mushrooms. Heck, anything fried is worth having, right?This is a small spot - probably mostly takeout, with just a few tables.

And they were right.Good things come to those who wait. Truer words haven't been spoken, and they may have been thinking about Mini Hut when they said it. It takes about 25-30 minutes to get your order of fried chicken. Trust me, it's worth the wait. Our chicken was crispy, tender, and delicious. We ordered a family pack of fried chickenthat came with fries and bread. It was more than we needed, so I had left overs.Believe it or not, my left overs tasted sooooo good. I couldn't believe it. Usually reheated fried chicken is soggy and dry. Not this fried chicken.

I settled for a mediocre turkey and apple panini from a sad looking coffee shop 20 feet from my gate.

The first result... \"Nuts on Clark\"??? It was the nut stand all along, it all made sense!

Like a bloodhound snooping for a clue, I followed the scent and came up on Nuts on Clark. A few thoughts quickly ran through my head:1) So this is where my aunts buy the yummy popcorn for us!!!2) Midway is a freaking awesome airport. They've got Potbelly AND Nuts on Clark!!!3) I just killed 2 birds with 1 stone by getting something sweet for myself after my Potbelly Sandwich AND buying a few bags as souvenir treats for my boyfriend and my dogsitter!!!I've never had the nuts but the popcorn is bomb-beezy! I love the cheesy cheese popcorn as well as the sweet caramel popcorn. Don't mistake this for the popcorn in the large tins you'd get as a gift during the holidays. Nuts on Clark oozes quality. It's hard to just have a handful of popcorn when there's an entire bag of it looking you straight in the eye taunting you finish it off!The store, inside the airport, \u00a0is small but well stocked with all sorts of goodies. You can opt to purchase the pre-packaged popcorn, but I preferred to buy the freshly made popcorn bagged right in front of you to take on your way. I ordered 4 'small' bags (there are various sizes and prices to choose from): 1 cheese and 1 caramel for me and 2 caramels, 1 each for my boyfriend and the dogsitter. You can opt to mix the popcorn in 1 bag, but I'm a purist and prefer each separately hence the 2 separate orders.

I didn't realize till I read the reviews that the slider bar was part of the sit-down sports bar portion, so there may indeed be some truth to the poor experience other yelpers had.The Food: As a slider concept, not a whole lot going on vegetarian wise, obvi. I had the Gardenburger sliders and chose the pretzel bun for them (not sure why - decided I don't like pretzel buns. They're cool to look at, but kinda dense. Maybe cuz the vegetarian has never had a pretzel bun option. Now I've been there, done that.) The Gardenburger was a black bean and grain blend from what I could tell, and had a pleasant texture. It had some bite and wasn't starchy and gummy at all (overwhipped-mashed-potato-like veggie patties are the WORST - veggie-friendly folks, you know what I'm saying). It came with guacamole, sour cream, tomato and lettuce. I hadn't even read the condiments (was in gimme-the-vegetarian-option-whatever-it-is-mode), so I was pleasantly surprised to find the sour cream and guac. It was served with potato chips, which were very thin and had a slightly bitter, overfried taste. I think they make their own, and it might behoove the restaurant to just buy kettle chip which are better quality and consistency or providing good ol' fashioned fries. Points for trying, but not well executed. The sliders were also served with a packet of mustard, ketchup and mayo, which were helpful as the slider itself was a bit bland.The Experience: That menu is damn overwhelming. It would be better utilized if the sandwiches were categorized by type (seafood, beef, specialty, etc). Service was not very pleasant. It was clear the women working there did not want to be there. I went to the bathroom and came back and my food was ready and there wasn't a line, so it wasn't too bad in terms of waiting. You have the option of choosing one slider for $8 (outrageous), two for $9, or three for $10 (prices rounded up). I ended up getting three because when they pointed to the bun, I was like, wtf that is TINY, but truth be told, I would have been satisfied with two. I didn't know it came with chips, so that ended up filling me up a bit too.The Background: I nearly missed my flight that day, waking up to \"check the clock\" at 7:35 for an 8:20 AM flight. I accidentally set the alarm wrong!! Holy @#%&!! But being the gangster I am, I totally made my flight with just/even ten minutes to spare, but I hadn't eaten anything or drank anything except for what was provided on the 4-hour flight to MDW. Because I was taking the same plane to Orlando, passengers stayed on, but I made the flight attendants let me off so I could get food/water, lest we have a medical emergency on the three hour flight to MCO, and that is how I ended up at OSBC and providing a four-star review.

She practically glared at me the whole time I was ordering. MORE importantly, however, is this is one of the biggest rip offs. While airport food is always marked up, this racket is one of the worst I've seen. At almost every slider place in America (meh, perhaps an exaggeration, but close), the general rule is there are single slider, double, triple, etc. options so you can order more sliders as a combo and not individually. Well, when I asked for a double and then started ordering the two sliders I wanted, the aforementioned cashier said, in the snottiest manner ever, \"You can't mix and match.\", giving me a look like \"how dare you\". So basically if you want to do any of the combos, you need to order all the same type of slider, and if you want any different ones, you need to order them all individually at $8 a pop for this tiny, palm sized sandwich. That's absurd. It didn't help my mood when I, taken aback, decided to switch my approach and order a salad, and in the same shitty tone, the cashier informed me that they were out. Her face indicated the same as before, disgust at my nerve at ordering a salad advertised on their menu. I ended up buckling and ordering one slider: the Pork Belly (since by the point, I already had it locked into my head, and I'm lazy.) I am pretty forgiving when it comes to food, airport food especially, but it was awful. It was basically the tiny bun (which WAS warm so that's the only positive thus far), maybe one tiny bite of pork, some apple somewhere (i couldn't really find it, but I tasted a hint), and about a whole bun's weight of mustard. There were also some blah chips. On, \u00a0but never fear, they gave me like 5 packets of mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup. I guess that's where I was getting my money's worth. I miss my $8.

The meat was stiff and tasted like it had been thrown in a microwave for 30 seconds to cook. The bacon was slimy and chewy. The whole wheat bun was soft and cold. It was really really bad.

Doubt it? Here's why---the great thin crust pizza doesn't come with attitude or randomly selected times for pick-up or delivery. If they say pick up in 20 minutes, it will be ready in 20 minutes. Delivery is within an hour? It will be there on time. The pizza is thin and the oven hot, and if you get sausage on it, the grease gets pulled down in to the crust and that help crisp it. Then there's the cornmeal. The cheese oozes over the sides and \u00a0is then structurally supported by the corn meal. One of the best pieces, after the corners. All the toppings, the sauce, etc. are very good. Another reviewer warned to get no more than two toppings. Great advice. This pie wasn't made for a vegetable garden.One of my concerns is the price. I found it odd that so many people said it was inexpensive. I find it quite the opposite. They recently printed new menus and the price variation from the pink menus to the new yellow ones goes up as much as $2 for a jumbo.

I ask you - who doesn't want a fat guy in their restaurant. My very physique promises a good tab. She wanted to force me into a booth. She - grudgingly - got me to a small table behind the Christmas tree - away from all signs of civilized life. The first waitress looked at me and passed me on to the second waitress. Big mistake. I am a big tipper. The second waitress - somewhat harried - apparently the first waitress has first right of refusal and was letting the second waitress take all the undesirable tables.She - the second waitress - came by and was quick and sweet and on the money. She brought me water and took my order. Now this place has signs all over the building boasting of the best soup in Chicago. The main reason I came in was the soup. I love soup. I drive by this place a few times a week and was intrigued. Best soup in Chicago? I'll be the judge of that.I ordered the Piergois which came with a bowl of soup. I opted for the minestrone. I have had better soup by Progresso. If these folks think they serve the best soup in the city, they need to get out more. The beans were undercooked - the zucchini was over cooked and broth had as much spice as a cup of snow.The second waitress actually brought me some nice (extra) dinner rolls. (When you are my size - people just assume you want extra dinner rolls. I didn't eat any, but I appreciated the gesture.) She also brought me a bigger glass of water.The Pierogis were not good. They were crispy and dry and boring. They came with a smear of apple sauce and an envelope of sour cream. They had about as much flavor as a cup of sand.As I got up to leave - I told the second waitress that her tip would be in the card. I am not a big fan of doing that. Some restaurants charge the credit card fee to the waitresses - they take it out of the tip.The bill was around 8 bucks. The tip was almost 4 bucks. When the mean old lady saw that I was a tipper - she tried to make small talk. Yeah - right,. make me feel welcome as I am leaving.

If there was an option to give NO STARS I would. I brought my kids and a friend here on a Friday night- restaurant had tables filled but it was not close to being packed. We sat down and I informed the non speaking English waitress that I had coupons (from restaurant.com) and we may have to sit at separate tables. She just shook her head and smiled. She brought us some chips and salsa- we finished that in about 7 minutes and still not have a waitress and no water was brought to the table. Waited some more while looking around for anyone in sight to bring us some water and the only waitress on the floor looked at me and ignored that fact I waved her over to our table. Well after about 15 minutes the same waitress that ignored me came and just took out her writing tab- no \"hello, how are you\" Nothing! Well I figured out that's because she also did not speak very good English. I started off with can we have some water and an order of Chile Con Queso- she said ok and walked away before I finished speaking. When she came back with the appetizer and water (7 min later) I informed her of the coupons I told the 1st waitress about, she was like \"Oh, you no use those here\" and I replied with I just purchased these right before we came here. She said \"oh well you can't use 2.\" I said ok well some of the kids are older (14) so they will sit by themselves at a separate table, it's a $10 gift cert and you have to spend at least $15 so regardless I will be paying out of pocket. Then she came up with the excuse that she can't just look at my phone for the certificate number, she needs the printout when it clearly states on the phone \"no need to print, just show this to your waitress\" She got aggravated and walked to the kitchen. I then followed her and asked for the manager- her response was the manager was gone for the day. REALLY? On a Friday night for dinner, there is no manager at the restaurant?!?!?! Then she started to speak Spanish to me- my reply back to her was \"I don't speak Spanish, this is America- I speak English\" I then asked who do I speak to regarding my gift certificates and she said she'll call the manager. Of course I could not understand anything she was saying since she was speaking Spanish on the phone for about 3 minutes, then handed the phone to me. The manager informed me that they don't take those gift certificates but he'll take 1 of them, I said well there are 6 of us so we'll sit at separate tables, like I said when we first came in. He said oh no we don't take those. Again I told him I just purchased these right before I came in. I have done this before at other Pepe's locations and never had a problem. I then started to tell him how horrible the customer service is at his restaurant- it took 15 min before a waitress came and we never even received any water. His reply to me was \"well, we don't give water unless you ask for it\" OMG~ the first restaurant ever been to where you have to ask for a glass of water! So I asked so what am I suppose to do, he said well you could just leave! I am appalled at how non-customer friendly this entire staff is at this restaurant and let him know. My kids already started eating the appetizer, I told them lets go!!!

In this talk thread, a Yelper mentioned Potbelly. After recently eating in Potbelly for the first time, I say ditto to the Yelper. \u00a0 Flying nearly across the continent from Washington DC to Las Vegas, we had a stopover in Chicago Midway. This was the perfect time to eat out. Last summer I vacationed in Chicago. I was well informed of Chicago's outstanding food. And I was well informed of all the Potbelly Sandwich Shops. It was time to give them a try. \u00a0 Before I go on, I wanted to bring up that if you are unfamiliar with potbelly; it does not mean being chubby. It is a word for stove. Potbelly Sandwich Shop goes back to a time when a couple that owned an antique store started to sell sandwiches. This store was off Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. Now there are several Potbelly Sandwich shops. Mostly in the midwest. Anyways, on the layover, I was thinking about eating by the time of my Las Vegas bound flight. A long line greeted me. The line moved fast, thanks to an employee taking the customers orders on line. This really expedited the progress of the line.  \u00a0 The dining area is the food court in the Southwest Airlines terminal. On my table lied the pizza sandwich. What a great idea!

It was time to give them a try. \u00a0 Before I go on, I wanted to bring up that if you are unfamiliar with potbelly; it does not mean being chubby. It is a word for stove. Potbelly Sandwich Shop goes back to a time when a couple that owned an antique store started to sell sandwiches. This store was off Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. Now there are several Potbelly Sandwich shops. Mostly in the midwest. Anyways, on the layover, I was thinking about eating by the time of my Las Vegas bound flight. A long line greeted me. The line moved fast, thanks to an employee taking the customers orders on line. This really expedited the progress of the line.  \u00a0 The dining area is the food court in the Southwest Airlines terminal. On my table lied the pizza sandwich. What a great idea!

I love that they run their sandwiches through the oven, allowing the cheese goodness to spread throughout the entirety of the sandwich. My food was prepared very quickly and was wrapped nice and neat. The woman taking the orders and the man adding the veggies and sauces were very friendly. Upon going to the cashier, my experience went downhill. The cashier was barely audible, speaking on a very low tone and failing to make any eye contact whatsoever. Jessica didn't even offer me a drink, so I had to grab a water that was located right next to her cash register myself. I also purchased a banana to go with my sandwich. Jessica didn't ask if I needed a bag, so I asked for one myself. She then proceeded to hand me a bag and make me put my own items in there! Is this Potbelly's policy? I was shocked. I understand it's 7 in the morning and we'd ALL rather be at home watching Netflix, but my goodness, if you're going to be rude and don't want to be at your job, which you are blessed to have, btw, at least pack my food in a bag.

My first experience at Salon Blu was with Deneen when I was around 7 months pregnant. She was patient, listened to me and understood my personal style, and gave me a flattering, low-maintenance cut that got me through the remainder of my pregnancy. I was really happy to find a place close to home with such a great stylist. A few months later, I tried to make another appointment with Deneen and learned she wasn't working there anymore. Sad. But, another stylist took my appointment and I was happy to go back. Frustratingly, that stylist didn't listen to me and kept insisting that she give me a \"stylish\" cut so that even when I didn't have time to style my hair on my own, it would still be \"styled\". With my hair, this kind of styling won't work, and I left quite frustrated that the woman cutting my hair ignored my requests AND the points I made about my hair and general sense of style. I didn't want to go back to Salon Blu. It had been about two years of 'just okay' haircuts from a neighbor when I absolutely needed to get my hair cut and styled again. I was out of my mind with dried hair and splitting ends. Out of desperation, I tried Salon Blu again. This time, my stylist was Heather, and she was awesome. Turns out that neighbor who was cutting my hair, who was giving me okay cuts for cheap, wasn't giving me the best cut for my money. (At least the cuts were cheap!) Heather took the time to cut my hair, even it out, and style it to my liking. My hair wasn't even dry and it already felt better. I left the salon, but not before making a follow-up appointment, and that's something I almost never do (I'm fussy and want to be sure I like my hair first.) Heather was truly awesome, and every follow-up style and cut with her has been exactly what I wanted/needed. \u00a0The salon itself is on the small side, but tastefully decorated and not overly trendy. It doesn't feel anything like the salons I grew up visiting (Old Lady Heavens). The services are all great, top notch and great quality.

Got on Yelp and found this little gem. Once I saw the reviews of Sammys I knew this was the place.They did not disappoint! From the moment we walked in we were taken care of like we were at a fine dining establishment. I wish I would have gotten their names but the gentleman working made sure our coffee was filled all the time, cut up my niece's French toast before bringing it to the table, opened the little creamers for our coffee, and when my sister sneezed he yelled \"bless you!\" from across the room. I know that seems like a small thing saying bless you but after the good service we had we knew this was a special place. Now the food! The ham!!! You have to have the ham. Normally when you ask for a slice of ham for breakfast you get the typical quarter inch slice of ham. At Sammys you get an inch thick, maybe more, piece of ham. It was so tender and seasoned to perfection. My mom and I shared an omelette because I read portions are generous here. Glad we did because it was more than enough for two people. It was the best omelette I have had in a long time. The ingredients tasted fresh and it was perfectly cooked. For all four of us to eat it was only $16! You can't beat that. My sister and I agreed even if I don't have a layover again in Chicago, the next time I'm visiting my family we are going to make the trip to Sammys just for the experience and food again.", "rating": "5"}, "1": {"date": [2016, 1, 22], "description": "Definitely will come back here . I walked in for the first time to this restaurant and asked where the nearest ATM is because I noticed the note on the door said cash only and I did not have cash.

When the food got to our table we noticed that the food comes in large portions and has a very generous price. I literally spent just $15 bucks on 2 people (excluding tip) and with the amount of food they gave us I had to be rolled out in a wheel chair!

Well Sam-I-Am ain't nevah had ham like this, or he would change his tune!!!!THE SCENEOne of the many reasons I love breakfast so much is because of being raised in Chicago. I always thought it was just our family, but it seems eating breakfast ANYTIME of day is a long standing tradition throughout the city. On a recent trip back home I discovered most of the places I grew up loving are no longer in business. Glady's Kitchenette was the benchmark of the best breakfast anywhere and it has sadly bit the dust along with other favorites like Miss Muffets on 79th and Bobby's on 90th. These were iconic spots that vividly materialize in my minds-eye everytime I think of the best breakfast places I've ever eaten. Bobby's and Miss Muffets in particular served their breakfast with ham carved off the bone! Let me tell you a secret... You haven't eaten breakfast until you've eaten breakfast with a giant slab of fresh cut ham!So when I heard Sammy's Kitchen was serving breakfast with fresh off the bone ham, I made it my duty to pay them a visit. Besides, they were only minutes from our hotel.THE EXPERIENCELocated in a tiny building with an even tinier parking lot on the corner of 55th and Luna Lane you will find this quaint little hole in the wall establishment. Nothing about this place is standard. The entrance door was propped open and you could see directly into the kitchen. I assumed it was a side door and walked around to the font of the building trying to find a proper entrance! NOT!!! The moment you walk in , to your right is a dark storage area with public restrooms just behind it. Directly in front of you is the kitchen counters and to the left is the dining room with a mish-mash of tables and chairs. It's a busy place, so without much standing room you tend to find people standing wherever they can, but generally blocking the entrance.This created a bit of a traffic jam for those coming in, those going out and the staff who unfortunately have to keep the refrigerated drinks and silverware outside of the kitchen near the congestion. You will hear \u00a0\"excuse me, I just need to get in there\" often as you wait to be seated. It took us 20 minutes to be seated, but honestly it flew by as I spent most of that time in conversation with my Chicago brethren waiting with me to be seated.THE FOODSammy is the definition of the term \"service with a smile.\" They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. They initially got my order wrong, but never sent it out because the manager/owner caught the mistake. They promptly told me of the error, but assured me they were working hard to get the order out quickly, and they did! - HAM & EGGS (3.75 stars) | $6.50It wasn't the exact flavor explosion I was looking to experience, but it did the trick. I enjoyed the ham more than the eggs. \u00a0- FRENCH TOAST (3.5 stars) | $3.95- VEGETARIAN OMELETTE SPECIAL (4 stars) | $4.50My wife loved it! Included onions, pepper, mushrooms, cheese, hashbrowns and toast.- CORNED BEEF HASH (1 star) | $ I did not enjoy this at all. Cooked too hard and had very little flavor.- Pancakes (3.75 stars) | included as a substitution- Hash browns (3 stars) | included This is old school Chicago style hash browns. Good, but would be awesome if they were seasoned. Featured on the TV show \"Off the Bone\": youtube.com/watch?v=yZ6J\u2026FINAL THOUGHTSThe portions are enormous, especially the ham slice, which could have fed my family all winter! I believe it is right at one pound of grilled porky deliciousness. We all enjoyed our meal and none of us could finish our plates because of the sheer amount of food. If I had any complaints it would be they added waaaaay to many onions to my eggs and I wish the hash browns were seasoned. Other than that we found the meal to be very enjoyable and super easy on the wallet.

Well Sam-I-Am ain't nevah had ham like this, or he would change his tune!!!!THE SCENEOne of the many reasons I love breakfast so much is because of being raised in Chicago. I always thought it was just our family, but it seems eating breakfast ANYTIME of day is a long standing tradition throughout the city. On a recent trip back home I discovered most of the places I grew up loving are no longer in business. Glady's Kitchenette was the benchmark of the best breakfast anywhere and it has sadly bit the dust along with other favorites like Miss Muffets on 79th and Bobby's on 90th. These were iconic spots that vividly materialize in my minds-eye everytime I think of the best breakfast places I've ever eaten. Bobby's and Miss Muffets in particular served their breakfast with ham carved off the bone! Let me tell you a secret... You haven't eaten breakfast until you've eaten breakfast with a giant slab of fresh cut ham!So when I heard Sammy's Kitchen was serving breakfast with fresh off the bone ham, I made it my duty to pay them a visit. Besides, they were only minutes from our hotel.THE EXPERIENCELocated in a tiny building with an even tinier parking lot on the corner of 55th and Luna Lane you will find this quaint little hole in the wall establishment. Nothing about this place is standard. The entrance door was propped open and you could see directly into the kitchen. I assumed it was a side door and walked around to the font of the building trying to find a proper entrance! NOT!!! The moment you walk in , to your right is a dark storage area with public restrooms just behind it. Directly in front of you is the kitchen counters and to the left is the dining room with a mish-mash of tables and chairs. It's a busy place, so without much standing room you tend to find people standing wherever they can, but generally blocking the entrance.This created a bit of a traffic jam for those coming in, those going out and the staff who unfortunately have to keep the refrigerated drinks and silverware outside of the kitchen near the congestion. You will hear \u00a0\"excuse me, I just need to get in there\" often as you wait to be seated. It took us 20 minutes to be seated, but honestly it flew by as I spent most of that time in conversation with my Chicago brethren waiting with me to be seated.THE FOODSammy is the definition of the term \"service with a smile.\" They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. They initially got my order wrong, but never sent it out because the manager/owner caught the mistake. They promptly told me of the error, but assured me they were working hard to get the order out quickly, and they did! - HAM & EGGS (3.75 stars) | $6.50It wasn't the exact flavor explosion I was looking to experience, but it did the trick. I enjoyed the ham more than the eggs. \u00a0- FRENCH TOAST (3.5 stars) | $3.95- VEGETARIAN OMELETTE SPECIAL (4 stars) | $4.50My wife loved it! Included onions, pepper, mushrooms, cheese, hashbrowns and toast.- CORNED BEEF HASH (1 star) | $ I did not enjoy this at all. Cooked too hard and had very little flavor.- Pancakes (3.75 stars) | included as a substitution- Hash browns (3 stars) | included This is old school Chicago style hash browns. Good, but would be awesome if they were seasoned. Featured on the TV show \"Off the Bone\": youtube.com/watch?v=yZ6J\u2026FINAL THOUGHTSThe portions are enormous, especially the ham slice, which could have fed my family all winter! I believe it is right at one pound of grilled porky deliciousness. We all enjoyed our meal and none of us could finish our plates because of the sheer amount of food. If I had any complaints it would be they added waaaaay to many onions to my eggs and I wish the hash browns were seasoned. Other than that we found the meal to be very enjoyable and super easy on the wallet.

When I walked in, it wasn't busy at all. I asked for a mani/pedi, regular polish - $38 (eh, okay, I usually get mine at a sale price of $35. But again I was trying the place, right?). There were only 2 patrons when I walked in. My pedicure was okay, the technician wasn't friendly nor accommodating. My feet soaked in cold water and when it came down to painting my nails, he rushed super quickly. Pedicure took at most 10-15 minutes, it was completely rushed. I still gave it a shot, I mean I still had the manicure to go...I had previous polish on, so he certainly looked a little irritated that he had to remove it... I can tell because when he started to put fresh polish on, I still had the residue of the old purple polish around my cuticles. I figured, oh he'll take it off later... Maybe. Next came the step on removing the dead skin around the cuticles... Boy, did that hurt. He literally snagged the dead skin off pinching me at each inch (I have a high level of patience, but at this point it was diminishing quickly). Next the polish came. He painted my nail to an imaginary line that made my nails look as if the nails were 85% painted... You could see the bottom of my fingernail unpolished (I'm a nail polish fan, I certainly could have done a better job!). Then it came down to getting my nails dry at which point I was left at the drying station for 20 minutes without any attendance as my coat was scattered on one chair, my beverage and shoes at another station. Evidently, I couldn't grab my belongings because my feet and hands were wet and I didn't receive any help in the meantime. An absolute terrible job, experience, and customer service! What a waste of money! My go-to is normally Elegant Nails, and you bet I'll be back there again.

They taste so fresh and are coated just right. A lot of fried shrimp I've had is just thick with breading. These are perfect. The jumbo shrimps are huge!

Brace yourself people for this one...I open a chalupa wrapper and there was 2 boogers STUCK to the inside of the wrapper!! Absolutely DISGUSTING!! I have pictures of it. The next day we saved the wrapper to see if possibly it was something else, but it hardered and turned brown. All day I had to think of something else to think of so that I wouldn't throw up because I had already eaten 1 chalupa and this had been the second one I opened up and thats the one that had the boogers stuck on it . I almost puked at the thought of possibly already eating a booger. I called their corporate office to address a formal complaint and told them I have pictures. One of the regional managers called me back when I gave them my information and then tried to argue with me that it wasn't a booger! Oh boy am I telling everyone in the neighborhood not to go there anymore and to warn people on yelp to NEVER eat here unless you want to eat someones snots. I'm no idiot, I know they were damn boogers.So, after I spoke with the regional manager, he said I can get a refund at the store after he was very rude to me and gave me attitude. The conversation was short and I didn't even get an apology! He didn't call me till like 3 or 4 days later after I made the complaint. Also, he asked me if I still had the wrapper so that they can send it to a lab, SERIOUSLY? I'm not going to keep a wrapper with boogers on it around my house! Also when I made the complaint I wasn't told to hold onto it. I went into the store to get my refund and the general manager said sourly that she was sorry. No empathy whatsoever and didn't show any emotion - as if boogers on wrappers are OK! She didn't even say she talked to employees or ANYTHING! I showed her the pictures because I have them on my phone and she made no face and didn't say anything. Are you kidding me? Wouldn't you be apologizing over and over and asking if there is anything she can do to make us come back? No, there was no urge for us to come back - and I tell ya, we were not yelling or argueing or doing anything to make her want us to leave!They need to close this place.

Was met with rudeness and she said I'm looking at the receipt and you did not order any guac and chips. You have to pay for them if you want them. Well, ok..if she is looking at the receipt then I am not going to argue with her. We bought another guac and chips.

Lucky us, we got to pay for overpriced, oddly bright neon green guacamole twice. Sigh...Here's some advice...when a customer tells you that you forgot something...take the time to ACTUALLY check the receipt instead of just jumping down their throat and assuming they are trying to get free food off you. Here is an even crazier idea...how about you not be rude? Maybe even apologize to a customer when you made a mistake?I can understand orders getting messed up when it's busy, but I don't mind if the staff is at least friendly.

Well, after some chatting via the counter gal to Mama and the cook; she said they would try and make one. \u00a0If we minus the fact that they added some warm salsa concoction to the mix, it would have been decent. \u00a0The only other drawback was that they charged me for a regular burrito, whereas most of you would know a breakfast burrito should cost a mere few dollars. \u00a0Eggs, spicy chorizo, cheese and some jalapenos or hot sauce is all I needed. \u00a0Since they were trying to construct a burrito, they kept asking why I didn't want the beans, the rice, the etc. \u00a0Decent fare and grossly inexpensive. \u00a0Most staff know basic English, so, complicated orders may not translate.", "rating": "3"}, "15": {"date": [2013, 11, 14], "description": "Excellent.

The ladies performing the massage are very friendly and make the atmosphere and massage comfortable.

My massager even suggested we should be best friends and to come back and see her again soon, which was basically a sales pitch to get you to come back. What also makes the Blooming Lotus astounding is the different varieties of massages they offer. Examples of some of the massages you can get are the back and neck massage, Rehabilative sports massage, Hot Stone massage, Indian Head Massage, even a pregnancy and infant massage! \u00a0However, the only thing depriving the Blooming Lotus of a five star rating is the costs of the massages. \u00a0Their pretty expensive ranging from as much as $40.00 for half an hour to $55.00 for 45 minutes. It also depends on what kind of massage you get. Some 75 minute massages can cost you $90.00 and some cost a $1.00 a minute. That's alot of money to consider putting into a massage.

She first cut my hair at her old job about 8 years ago and I had long hair down to my waist and donated 10 inches for children with cancer. I had never had short hair in my life and Linda made me LOVE it! She gave me the best hair cut and everyone always asked me who cut my hair when I was in high school.I am now in college and I have gone to her for my haircuts and also she was the one who dyed my hair first. She gave me subtle highlights to get a feel since I was always used to dark brown hair. I was no longer a \"hair color virgin\" as she put it. Since then, she gave me an ombre which people STILL tell me it's one of the best ombres they have ever seen! The one thing I love about Lynn is that she always listens to you and cuts your hair according to how you want it and I always leave the salon loving my new hair. She is also awesome at giving tips incase you are confused in what you are looking for.

The best WonTon soup ever, loaded with dumplings, and a broth that actually has a taste, and a great one it is. Plus, they don't glop the same salty brown sauce on everything like some places.

As a matter of fact you're right in saying that the only thing wrong with the pizza was that it was not pie cut which was the way that we requested it and were promised over the phone and \u00a0confirmed by the cashier when we picked up the order. The real problem was the way it was addressed on the phone when we called, the problem was small and as a customer it was forgivable, however the treatment we received from that sorry excuse of a manager, Jimmy, who must be related to you for you to take his side this passionately and offend your customers over him. He told us he does not have to accommodate our request, like it's optional to give a paying customer what they are requesting. That is a ridiculous business practice. Also I did not want a new pizza made, I was 30 minutes away from your location. as I recall from our talk this was a take it or leave it offer, we wanted future consideration for the mistake and for you all to admit it was your mistake, instead we were blamed and dismissed when we called to voice our complaint, maybe you feel you can do that to customers because of the traffic you get, but let this be a lesson to you in customer service, there is no bad customer who is paying their tab only someone you have wronged. So at the end of our conversation you told me to take it or leave it on the new pizza so we had you make it and later decided we are not going to accept being treated like this from a business we pay good money to. It was inconsiderate of you to make us drive back, we had plans and wanted the triangle cut for our family from New York not to fool them but as a nice family gesture, instead they got to see first hand a chicago business owner/manager behaving worse than a new york food cart vendor. It's ironic because new yorkers have the reputation of being rude, but you are taking that title back for chicago business owners. I am truly dissapointed in you as the owner of the business, I'm sure you are not the original owner or it might have been passed down through the family to you, in which case you're dissapointing them. This should have been resolved with a call back from you to offer the $3 off to us on our next order as appreciation for all the business we have given you over the years and for having to be talked down to by your boy Jimmy. Instead you show off how lost you are as a business owner by posting this comment on here offering $3 to all the customers who read this, not a smart money move. Also calling three of your customers stooges is offensive, even though you listened to someone who assured you it would get some laughs. It just shows again how little you value your customers, the customer you have reading this must wonder when you will turn on them and call them names on the internet, what small request will cross your line next, an extra plate or some parmesan , where does a request become too much to ask for that your feel you don't have to accommodate it. Good luck to you and your business I hope you have more focus on customer satisfaction in the future, a request might be small to you but vastly important to those paying for your pies. You might think that you'll never lose your business because the restaurant has been around for so long, but other businesses who thought that have been proven wrong and had their doors closed. You are not the only game in town, I used to drive to pick up from you all the way from the western suburbs and because of this poor experience and reaction from you I don't anymore. I will however recommend some other pizza places that have a better product than yours and have no problem earning the money I work hard for.

Originally it seemed an odd placement with another Walgreens on the same street less than a mile west. But the goal here was being the last \"store\" before arriving at Midway Airport if you're coming from Chicago and taking Cicero avenue. And their goal has paid off as this location is very busy while not affecting the customer flow of the other Walgreens down the street. The design of this location is that of all the Walgreens built in the last few years with cosmetics, seasonal, and food goods aisles all facing the traditional Walgreens direction but all other aisles near the back half facing \"sideways\". It seems done that way to force more customers past the cold beer and refrigerated drinks or frozen treats. The main register area has a large queue line \u00a0that still sometimes isn't big enough. The photo kiosk area is also connected to the register area allowing the photo employee able to walk a few feet to run a register during the busy moments. The pharmacy has the new style queue where you first check in on the computer to pick up your order and then you wait in the small waiting room for your name to be called. This could use clearer signage as many customers are really confused about what to do. The pharmacy also has a drive thru that exits you out to the side street on the west side of the building. There is a fair selection of fresh fruits and veggies along with a coffee station. This matches most of the newer Walgreens locations. The parking lot is not huge but has very wide driving lanes to allow for easy movement of cars coming and going. As you exit the parking lot at either exit you MUST turn right. This is a result of building on a very busy and wide intersection. Customer service here seems friendly enough. There are usually enough employees to ask for assistance within the aisles and the register staff usually moves people out quickly.

What I can say is the fresh strawberry filling is great and the team that does the decorating is top rate and can accommodate pretty much any request. Since they purchased the land to the east of the building there is rarely an issue with parking except pre Easter or Christmas rushes. If we plan on going in later in the day I always call in my donut order early so I'm guaranteed to get what I want and it's ready when I get there so I'm in and out within a few minutes.

I showed up 5 minutes before pick up time and they didn't even start on my order.The third time I used the app again and this the wait time was less to pick up( 15 minutes).

Ok fine. 15 minutes pass and I asked where my order was and the girl grabbed this bag on the back counter and said \"oh you're order has just been sitting here, sorry.\" I get to my car and check my order, and the food was cold, so I went back in and asked for another order. I had to wait another 15 minutes, get my new order and that one was barely even any warmer than the original one they gave me.
