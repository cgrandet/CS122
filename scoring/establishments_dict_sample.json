So far, I've tried the chicken philly (like a Philly cheesesteak but with chicken) and the Berger (two party burger with pastrami and 1000 island dressing). Both were solid, filling, and they have a great list of sides to choose from. Service is also good, and interior design is clean and comfortable. Will definitely be coming back."},

It's more of a hike than one expects, coming from the Booth building on 58th, but so long as it's not iced over, the walk is safe and brisk.I've gotten the bagel and lox a couple times. Contrasting it to my preferred city bagel at NYC Deli, Bergstein's is a little saltier and definitely skimpier on the smoked salmon. It'll set you back a Hamilton (soon to be Tubman?), which is not cheap, but hey, it's Chicago."}, "17": {"date": [2015, 2, 17], "rating": "4", "description": "The sandwiches are very good and the service is friendly and quick. All of the sandwich elements are excellent. The meat is high quality and the breads are fresh and delicious. I had the potato salad as a side. It was good but didn't blow my mind and I would have liked a little larger portion. The pickle spear served with each sandwich is really good. I could probably eat a jar full no problem. Overall a really good experience that is way better than most of what Hyde Park has to offer."}, "16": {"date": [2015, 7, 16], "rating": "3", "description": "Ordered the Benson burst that's corned beef,pastrami Swiss on rye an a side of onion rings it was great"}, "19": {"date": [2015, 4, 19], "rating": "5", "description": "Loved my lunch! I got the second city sandwich, cold with lettuce, tomato, mustard and mayo. It was so good. You can have your sandwich hot or cold and it comes with a pickle and one side.

This place is good for grabbing a quick bite or eating out with friends."}, "18": {"date": [2014, 10, 18], "rating": "5", "description": "Oh. Em. Jee. This place totally hits the spot. Amazing grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad and pickle for $5. Add a cup of matzoh ball soup for $4.50, and you have in every happy, totally stuffed customer. Plus the hubs loved his whitefish salad and bagel - better than NY delis, he says. Decor is basic fast food but big window views of Augustana Lutheran Church and gorgeous fall leaves make up for it.

Went because I thought it's find a NY type bagel selection, but it was slim picking for morning. Only 2 cream cheese flavors (what does Chicago have against flavored cream cheese anyway?), which was disappointing. Guys behind the counter were nice, quick and fist bumped with my toddler, so that was cute. Over all a nice place for lunch or a quick snack."}},

Try the chicken shawarma which is decent. Make sure they don't overcharge you. The man/owner won't--he's great. But that grumpy old woman who works there will ALWAYS overcharge you and unfortunately you can't even understand her when she speaks if you want to contest it. I generally try to avoid her at all costs. Even still, if you're craving a different sandwich, try it out.

Gotta love canned stuffed grape leaves.My one problem with Valley Of Jordan is that it's not a one stop shop. The produce selection (at least right now when it has just opened) would be generously described as minimal, and most of the foods are standard convenience store and CVS items. Eggs and milk are from factory farms, and the spice selection is pretty bare. I still have to go to Hyde Park Produce for the stuff I need. VoJ right now is really only good for a handful of thongs I want."}, "21": {"date": [2015, 8, 21], "rating": "5", "description": "Best food in the neighborhoo.

I was pleasantly surprised to see they have middle eastern food so I made a point to drop back by later on. I went by today for lunch and overall was disappointed. They didn't have any lamb schwarma available, which may have made a huge difference in my experience. (I love lamb) Instead I had the chicken schwarma, which wasn't nearly as savory as the ones from Nile on 55th. If I'm ever by there and have a chance to try the lamb I might change my mind, but in general I don't see myself making a plan to go back."}, "02": {"date": [2012, 11, 2], "rating": "5", "description": "AMAZING SHAWARMA!!! This place is like a little corner store meets deli ... it's a gem. Discovered it a few weeks ago and have gone there a few times since then. Very clean and the owner is very friendly."}, "29": {"date": [2014, 8, 29], "rating": "4", "description": "I initially had a negative experience with the cashier other reviewers mentioned, which I presume is the old woman who co-owns the place. She was quite grumpy at first, which scared me off of this place for a few months. But she definitely warms up to you. After I lived in the area for two years she would chat me up and ask me what I was cooking with what I was buying, etc. Also, by that time they'd let me haggle for bulk purchases, helped spot me bags and quarters when I was desperate, etc.This is a pretty good place to buy certain items. If you catch them while they have fresh meat coming in (which is every couple of days) it's probably the cheapest in the area. Treasure Island can be a little cheaper sometimes I guess, but that's a fair distance to walk from 53rd and Ellis and it's not that much cheaper.They have pretty good prices on basics like oil, flour, sugar, cleaners, and so on. They don't have much produce, though they have some basics like potatoes and onions. I've never ordered a sandwich from the deli so I can't comment on that. They also sell some prepared food under the counter. The spinach pie is okay--I prefer Hyde Park Produce's, but sometimes you don't have the motivation to walk that far. The hummus is great, although they don't always have pita bread that \u00a0isn't frozen. Do try their imported candy bars!Overall, it's a quirky small shop and as long as you can accept its quirks it can work out pretty well for you."}, "27": {"date": [2015, 3, 27], "rating": "5", "description": "An absolutely great store they do amazing sandwiches and lunch meat to go.

I've had a few of their sandwiches (I believe a Roast Beef, Sumac Chicken, and Garlic Chicken) and nothing has disappointed. I would definitely recommend getting your sandwich with the Crunch bread (I'm forgetting the exact name of it) but it's delightful! If you're hard-pressed to make a decision among the vast choices (many veggie and vegan options, too!), the owner will happily give his recommendations.Out of all the development Hyde Park has been going through in the past few years, Cafe 53 is one of only three places that I believe is worth repeatedly visiting.Go there.

I recommend eating there so you can get it delivered to you fresh after preparation as (especially the vegetarian/vegan ones) some of the sandwiches get a bit sloppy quickly with the dressings and such soaking into the bread. I, personally, love their eggplant sandwiches. They are quite large and very filling. No real options for sides for those who want some fries or something with their order, but you can get some chips. If you're in the mood for gelato... oh man! They have some great, original flavor options. I tried a scoop of basil with a scoop of ricotta - which had a great cheesecake taste to it when combined. The server just kept providing me sample after sample with various combos to see what I might like. So many yummy options - I could hardly decide."}, "17": {"date": [2015, 9, 17], "rating": "4", "description": "Ok so the ambience needs a little work, but this place has turned into one of my favorite spots.

The blueberry soda. OMG! This place carries it. I grabbed the last bottle and heard that they will stock it up again soon. So excited! So, yes this place offers really unique things.

If you're cooking a meal from scratch, you'll likely be able to find every ingredient. -They carry some high end specialty products (e.g., non-wheat flours, stone ground matcha green tea powder, vanilla beans, gluten free cookies)-There are a few things that are better priced here than chain stores. For example, kerrygold reserve cheddar cheese is 4.29 here, but runs 5.00-8.50 at other grocery stores. Organic milk and free range omega 3 eggs are also cheaper than what you'd expect at a chain.-The staff is ALWAYS nice-They carry bread from Medici, a local bakery/restaurantCons:-It's a neighborhood market, and they don't carry a lot of national brands. If you're trying to get Cheerios and Coca Cola, you'll have to head next door to CVS-Sometimes the produce available is ready to be eaten THAT day. Just make sure you look at what you're getting and feel it for its consistency-It's a little bit small and can get crowded on weekends or after work. I avoid peak hours-There are a few products that seem more expensive here than elsewhere, such as rice. It could also be that they're selling a different quality of rice, but I'm usually just looking for cheap when it comes to rice-I once saw a block of cheese in the deli specialty cheese section that was expired. If it's a food that doesn't see a lot of turnover, check the expiration date-Meat is expensive. Then again, this has helped me keep my meat consumption down.Overall, this is my favorite place to shop in Hyde Park. For the few items that they don't carry, I can usually get them at CVS right next door."}, "16": {"date": [2013, 10, 16], "rating": "1", "description": "Horrid. What a cluster F***.

Avoid the flavored coffees (with the exception of the homemade Diablo syrup).I want to love Robust, but I can't give 5 stars because they are lacking in quality and attention to detail.

The honey and rich coffee work together really well, actually, with the flavors complementing each other and not conflicting. The \"nut\" part of the drink (probably almond syrup) was a nice touch, and I think that was what made the whole thing quite sweet. It's an excellent iced coffee, with a rich sweetness.

I really hate to give bad reviews but I have to on this caf\u00e9 in hopes the service will get better. I walked in and noticed the quiet relaxing atmosphere and was in love, so I thought. I walked to the counter and no one greeted me. Strike one... I wanted to try the Banana nut shake but I'd given the wrong name and boy did they let me know. I was told there was no such shake and nothing even close to a banana nut shake. I saw a new on the counter, apologized for giving the wrong name then asked for a caramel nut shake only to be told, they didn't have any ice cream and couldn't make the shake (it was @12pm on the Tuesday). No one offered an alternate or another type of beverage, nor was I told when they'd have the ingredients to make said drinks. This place is similar to Starbucks so I wouldn't expect they'd not have ingredients to beverages considering that's pretty much all they sell and their specialty (supposingly). If shakes are a seasonal item, I can accept and understand that even after reviewing the menu online and traveling about 15 miles to become a customer.

The waffles are super doughy and fresh-off-the-iron warm, and I've never had anything so melt-in-your-mouth before.
