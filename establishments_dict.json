When it comes to the other items in the grocery store they are kind of pricey...but I understand it's a small neighborhood store and I want to give back to small businesses. Customer service is nice. Overall they try to keep the store clean."}, "10": {"date": [2013, 11, 10], "rating": "3", "description": "This place is in a convenient area, and the inside looks a lot nicer than the outside leads you to believe. Produce section is actually pretty good and some of the prices in the veggie aisle are not too bad. The prices on the raw meat on the other hand? Atrocious. Place is pretty expensive for most things but there isn't much to choose from in the area with the lack of super markets and grocery stores. All in all, if you are too lazy to drive further or you don't mind spending a bit more coin, then this place is acceptable."}, "27": {"date": [2015, 10, 27], "rating": "4", "description": "Fresh produce at a decent price. Friendly cashiers.

BUT! The produce is great here! And affordable! Found great deals on items that are hard to find: Serrano peppers, fennel, honeycrisp apples, and fresh herbs. Will definitely be back!"}, "14": {"date": [2014, 7, 14], "rating": "5", "description": "This place made my weekend! Having only been shopping on 55th's Treasure Island \u00a0and Open Produce, I really wanted to check out what Hyde Park Produce offers. Initially, I didn't even go in with a basket. I thought to myself I am just going to browse. However, as soon as I got in, I saw the $2.99/ lb Rainier cherries and the $1.49 for a 16oz. fresh organic strawberries. I had to read and re-read the signs to make sure I was reading correctly. I even waived down a customer service person to help me read the signs. So yes, things are cheap here. I quickly grabbed a basket thinking that I may only walk away with a few things.As I continued down the aisles, I found that the one drink that I have been looking for all summer last year in Maryland. The blueberry soda. OMG! This place carries it. I grabbed the last bottle and heard that they will stock it up again soon. So excited! So, yes this place offers really unique things. Another product that I got was the pink lady apple juice. I love pink lady apples, so we'll see how I like this drink.The deli/ cheese section is also very good. They have a good nice selection. The servers behind the counter are also very helpful and nice.I love, love this place!"}, "17": {"date": [2014, 9, 17], "rating": "4", "description": "Pros: -Large variety of produce, including carambolas (seasonal), heirloom tomatoes, dragonfruit on occasion, etc.-Most of the produce is pretty cheap, and certainly much cheaper than the chain groceries in Chicago-They have all of the basics. If you're cooking a meal from scratch, you'll likely be able to find every ingredient. -They carry some high end specialty products (e.g., non-wheat flours, stone ground matcha green tea powder, vanilla beans, gluten free cookies)-There are a few things that are better priced here than chain stores. For example, kerrygold reserve cheddar cheese is 4.29 here, but runs 5.00-8.50 at other grocery stores. Organic milk and free range omega 3 eggs are also cheaper than what you'd expect at a chain.-The staff is ALWAYS nice-They carry bread from Medici, a local bakery/restaurantCons:-It's a neighborhood market, and they don't carry a lot of national brands. If you're trying to get Cheerios and Coca Cola, you'll have to head next door to CVS-Sometimes the produce available is ready to be eaten THAT day. Just make sure you look at what you're getting and feel it for its consistency-It's a little bit small and can get crowded on weekends or after work. I avoid peak hours-There are a few products that seem more expensive here than elsewhere, such as rice. It could also be that they're selling a different quality of rice, but I'm usually just looking for cheap when it comes to rice-I once saw a block of cheese in the deli specialty cheese section that was expired. If it's a food that doesn't see a lot of turnover, check the expiration date-Meat is expensive. Then again, this has helped me keep my meat consumption down.Overall, this is my favorite place to shop in Hyde Park. For the few items that they don't carry, I can usually get them at CVS right next door."}, "16": {"date": [2013, 10, 16], "rating": "1", "description": "Horrid. What a cluster F***. Impossible to find what you need and they don't carry most regular products that you'd need. Wanted to try them out but left with more then half my list not done. Waste of time.Have to update my review. Cut open a red potato to find it ROTTEN in the middle. Totally black and disgusting. Open my shredded cheese today and it had MOLD in it.

I should get my money back!!!"}, "24": {"date": [2015, 3, 24], "rating": "2", "description": "This place has the tiniest selection of goods I have ever seen. You want a bag of chips, here is one brand that makes \u00a04 different varieties. Same with the selection of cereal, dairy products, etc. \u00a0It is really only good for the necessities like eggs and milk. \u00a0Plus it is always crowded since the store is small and it is hard to find what you are looking for."}, "09": {"date": [2015, 8, 9], "rating": "3", "description": "I shop here because of convenience and nothing more. Produce quality is inconsistent and grocery items are incredibly overpriced. I'm sure the owners feel they can charge for such convenience and having such a captive audience. One of the things that bothers me the most is that many of the cashiers wear rubber food service gloves while handling money. The gloves look dirty, many have holes in them, so they are not changed out (magic gloves, if you will). Then they are handling my produce, groceries, bags etc. I get it, money is gross...but CHANGE YOUR GLOVES. Dirty gloves do not help anyone I adore supporting local businesses, but for my grocery needs, I am counting the days until Whole Foods opens down the street. Better product, more variety and definitely more helpful and customer focused staff. Also, salad bar.I will be sorry to see a local neighborhood grocery store go out of business when a large corporate vendor moves in down the street, but I feel you brought it on yourself."}, "29": {"date": [2014, 8, 29], "rating": "4", "description": "Yesssss I love hyde park produce!If you want a really unassuming, good sandwich, the deli is fresh and the staff is friendly.

Overall impression from shopping here all the time (due to proximity) is that while the produce section might be cheaper than the other closest grocery store in the area (Treasure Island), the quality is lacking. Fruits (esp. apples) often appear to have gone through some rough times in transport as a lot of them are bruised and scarred. Vegetables noticeably age a lot faster than produce from Treasure Island (esp. herbs). The one thing I really like is that they have Valentina Sauce, my absolute favorite Mexican salsa picante. Almost tempted to up one star, but will refrain from biased reviews."}, "15": {"date": [2014, 10, 15], "rating": "4", "description": "I LOVE Hyde Park Produce!! This small, neighborhood produce market offers fresh quality produce and a decent size selection of health foods and international foods. The staff is friendly and approachable and the prices are JUST RIGHT. They also have a nice hot bar and cold bar. Each day they have fresh sushi provided by The SitDown (next door) so you can get your quick sushi fish and KNOW that its fresh and yummy.

Prices seem high and they don't seem to have much outside the produce section, which is the largest part of the store. Hot bar is pretty good if you catch them early before the plantains dry out. Good service from the workers back there though. They always prompt me to try them first if they think they look a little dry. 1/3 times they were edible and delicious.

On nice days it opens up to the street, and there's a lot of wood and brick, giving it a super comforting feel. More importantly, the fare is fantastic! I had a lemon bar and a fresh-brewed iced tea, both of which were delicious, and I stole a bite of their signature waffles from a friend. They were AMAZING. The waffles are super doughy and fresh-off-the-iron warm, and I've never had anything so melt-in-your-mouth before. Over all, highly recommend the place.A total plus: I had a chat with the owners, and they make a point of hiring local kids from the Woodlawn area, as well as supporting local entrepreneurship.

The batter is imported from Belgium and if you've ever tried to recreate true Belgium street waffles you know they are NOTHING like the spongy mess you get at American pancake houses.

It's right down the street from where I stay in the Cottage Grove/Green Line area, but I do not feel completely safe walking to it.
