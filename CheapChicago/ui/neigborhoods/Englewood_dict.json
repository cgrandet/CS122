Second, she did not make the effort to cut my cuticles. The pedicure itself did not even last for 15 minutes. It felt like something I can do myself at home. After my pedicure, she told me to go this room for my eyebrows and then again, I was disappointed. The eyebrow waxing itself was a bigger joke than the pedicure. I told her I wanted a clean up for my eyebrows. She did five strips of waxing and DID NOT HELP ME SHAPE MY BROWS. She didn't tweeze the excess part of my brows. She didn't even help me trim it at all. Literally, 5 strips of waxing and told me I was done. I ended up trimming it and fixing it myself at home.

I've noticed my hands have had quite a few hangnails. And my a few, I mean 8. My cuticles are pretty snagged up, and the peeling of my nails is bad. On top of that, the heels of my feet are disgusting. I don't expect my feel to be baby smooth two weeks after a pedicure, but I had noticed they weren't too smooth within hours of my service, and they've gotten so much worse since. I was literally scrapping them in the shower to try and remove some of it. I've had a few mani pedis, but I've never had this problem before. Is it the weather? Maybe. I'll possibly try them again and see what happens. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Iwent in for a Mani pedi. Nice little birthday gift to myself, and it was a nice way to spend the credits I had on Whittl. The man at the front was super nice. Took my coat, and offered me tea. My nail tech wasn't that pleasant. No hello or anything, just went right to work. I'm not one for small talk so it didn't bother me that much, but at least a greeting and a smile or something would have been nice. She kept looking around while doing my nails, like I was wasting her time or something. But for the actual nails, she did a good job. After not doing much of anything to my nails for a couple months, they were in some rough shape. Now they're smooth and I'm loving the polish. I liked the mini massage at the drying station, and the older lady that helped me into my shoes and coat was nice. I also liked that they put a little bag over my feet so that my shoes didn't wreck my polish. The only issue was that my feet became sooo itchy during my 2 minute walk home. It subsided after a few minutes but it was awful during that short time. All in all, I did like the place. More so than another nail shop I went to a little south on Clark. I booked my appointment, paid and tipped all online so that wasn't a hassle. The place didn't reek of chemicals. I got a pretty nice mani pedi for a decent price. If you're not looking for an exceptionally attentive high class spa experience, this is a good place to go. And if you haven't tried Whittl to book and pay for appointments online, you should!

I got a no-chip manicure. One of my biggest pet peeves is when the nail polish doesn't cover the entire nail - especially at the base of the nail. I understand that it shouldn't touch the cuticle, but there shouldn't be so much space that it looks like I got my manicure a week ago. When I asked my manicurist not to leave a space at the base because it looks grown out, she seemed confused as to what on earth I could be talking about, made a face, said something in another language to the manicurist next to us, and then told me \"eventually they'll grow out anyway.\" (Not sure what that's supposed to mean, or how it relates to how my manicure should look TODAY.) But, despite her seeming disagreement with my request, she did fix most of the nails. When the manicure was done, I noticed that there was something pointy stuck in the nail polish on one finger. I asked her to fix it, to which she replied that it can't be fixed. She again said something in another language to the manicurist next to us, and that manicurist scooted over, saw the issue, acknowledged that it can be fixed, and filed down the pointy thing sticking out of the nail polish. \u00a0My manicurist then began repainting my nail, and since I noticed that there was a big space between the cuticle and the polish at the base of my nail, I asked her to please paint it beginning at the base. She looked up, gave me a condescending look, and said \"I am.\" When this was all finally over, she stood up, said I'm done, and walked away. No thank you, no bye, no happy holidays, etc. I am not sure what prompted her to be so rude and condescending. I'm not a difficult customer. I am not confrontational, I am polite, I don't have over-the-top expectations, and I certainly wasn't rude or mean to her today. But, when I get a manicure, I expect it to look a certain way, especially when it's a no chip manicure that's supposed to last me up to two weeks.

Today, I called in a pick up for two tacos, no onions. I get home and both orders have onions. I return, it takes me about 15 minutes to walk from my house to deli king. The young lady who took my order the first time did not inform the cooks about my wrong order, so I had to wait 20 minutes for my order to be remade. One of the cooks ask me if I want sauce on my fries and I ask for mild sauce, along with jerk sauce on the tacos because the previous order was dry. He began to inform me that no sauce comes on the tacos, only salsa, I remind him that the salsa has onions. He gives me this oh well look and I proceed to ask for a side of jerk sauce again. He \u00a0laughs says some snide remark, I let him know he is acting very rude and has poor customer service.

I wasn't to thrilled with the Panini, because when you think Panini you think flat and wide and packed full of heaven.

Sikia is a Swahili word for a synthesis of sensory input, a nice interesting name for a dining room. Sikia features a lot of African dishes but on this occasion their Valentine's special menu sounded too good to pass up, a multi-course not particularly ethnic affair which I assume gave them a chance to practice various kitchen disciplines. On the appetizer sampler plate, we especially enjoyed the grape encased in goat cheese and rolled in pistachio. The salad featured grilled quail, how cool is that! This was followed by two, yes, two entrees: salmon with morel sauce (I'm tellin' ya!) on saffron risotto with asparagus; and lamb glazed with pomegranate molasses and fig, over mashed potatoes. OK, the execution was not entirely perfect, both could have been a little less cooked, but this was still a wonderful couple of courses and quite a deal. The lamb sauce was definitely one of the more interesting and delicious things we'd eaten in a long time. The triple whammy dessert was exciting too, a flourless chocolate cake, a peppery chocolate panna cotta, and a chocolate sorbet (attractively non-creamy). It's BYOB, though they did toss in a glass of some so-called champagne. Their interior decor is a bit on the dry side and could use some livening up and personality.
