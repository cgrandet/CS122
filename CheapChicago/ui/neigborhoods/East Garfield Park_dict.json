It's beautiful compared to the junk stores that are nearby (Ie.. Lemingtons foods etc) I haven't been here in a few years but the problem is this. .The barbers were EXCELLENT!! extremely professional and friendly ... Curteous..and their prices are Fantastic!! I would highly recommend them to anyone! My issue was with the Salon Part of the Place.. I took my daughter here to get her hair done by the salon owner.... My daughter was 11 at the time . The Stylist charged her Full price.. Never recommended that her ends needed to be trimmed or that there was breakage (Summer swimming and surgery may have contributed) .. and her hair only lasted maybe a day at most when I've just spent $50 on her hair.. Ouch!! I still attempted to let her go two more times.. thinking ok maybe there was a mishap. I explained to the Stylist that her hair was falling apart so the style wasn't working.. Neither time did she bother to mention trimming her ends or the breakage so that it wouldn't break anymore.. the final straw was when my daughter had a 3pm appointment.. her hair should've taken no longer than 2 hrs.. and she wasn't ready to go home until after 8:30 pm on a school night.. why ? because the stylist stopped to braid her boyfriend or whomevers hair. My daughter was 11.. She didn't need to be there 4+ hours just because some \"Dude\" needed his hair french braided.. not on my dollar. We've since found a fabulous person to do her hair \u00a0who makes recommendations.. for the price.. i just feel that people must be on their game. The barber was great until he left so i don't take my son there anymore but for hair cuts.. a great place for men to go.

How bad can it be?Let me first start by asking the yelp gods for forgiveness! Why oh why didn't I take the one-star rating and drive to another location?? It was just after 10pm. Though I'm sure the inside was still open at this 24-hour location, everyone seemed to have opted for the drive thru.

WRONG! 6 cars in front of us and 20 minutes later, it wasn't quick and the fries were terrible. I mean 5-day old grease terrible! Not to mention, after waiting in line for 20 minutes, my money was counted and ready to be handed over for what I had convinced myself would be the greatest guilty pleasure trip to round out my weekend. When I pulled up to the window (they have two windows: the typical pay window and pickup window. Why they were only using one was beyond me), the cashier quoted a different amount. Maybe it seems like less of a big deal but after 20 minutes of unbearably loud music from the van behind us and what I'm almost positive was a drug deal in front of us, I now have to get out more change that I could have spent the last 20 minutes sorting through?!?

First of all, despite what many have claimed about Honky Tonk, I find the place to be rather grimy. Grease seems to linger in the air and when combined with unwashed floor grit, the whole restaurant feels stuffy and out-dated. Oddly, some people seem to care for this feel, I do not. Not in a place that serves food. I've tried several of their meats; I am unimpressed to say the least. Honky Tonk cold smokes their meats and oddly enough, serves the food cold. Like day old, stagnant, luke warm. Anyone that knows anything about true barbecue, knows that good barbecue does not need \"barbecue sauce.\" I have observed the majority of paying customers in this joint smothering their chicken and pulled pork sandwiches with barbecue sauce... And laughing, carrying on with their day. Shameful. Their prices are beyond ludicrous for their sub-par cooking-- 7$ for seven SLICES of fried tomatoes!! Ha! Just... Awful. Anyways, I did enjoy the bands \u00a0and ensembles that came through during my visits, and the guys behind the bar are great... Just not great enough for me to return. Ever. If you want decent barbecue try County BBQ, off Taylor street. That place gives you more bang for you buck with good food and less plaid shirts... Oh God, the sea of plaid shirts at Honky Tonk...

After a longish bus ride from Willis Tower, we made it to the neighborhood. It's located in what seems to be an up and coming area. As we walked toward the restaurant, we were beckoned by the sound of live 1920s jazz music. The door was propped open and we could hear that a good time was to be had inside.We entered the bar which was packed and very loud with the music and customers. The bar is smallish with very loud acoustics. The large sound system could have definitely been turned down by 20%. Aside from the noise, the ambiance was excellent and very cool. The band was great. The bar was dimly lit, full of random photos and oil paintings, and a beautiful old wooden bar. Unfortunately, it was also swelteringly hot inside. It appeared that the bar was being cooled by window unit air conditioners that were clearly inadequate for the room. Everyone I saw in the bar, ourselves included, was noticeably sweaty.We were unable to find any staff initially but knew we wanted to stay despite the heat and noise. This was an authentically cool Chicago bar.Eventually we sat ourselves at an unbussed table and a friendly waitress later came to clear the table and serve us.

While many other pulled pork sandwiches served at other restaurants tend to be greasy, runny, and sloppy to eat, this one was nice and tender but dry; perfect to add their house made BBQ sauce. They had both a sweet and tangy barbecue sauce. Both were excellent. I preferred the tangy even though I'm generally averse to spicy foods and sauces.

Honkey Tonk is a low-key, casual/divey, neighborhood bar that serves up an appetizing menu of BBQ, brews & specialty house drinks. I guess it has\u00a0a more countryish theme than your average Chicago bar cuz it's called \"Honkey Tonk,\" serves Q & country-sounding, specialty drinks & plays music that's not hip-hop, pop, rock or alternative. But that's about as country as it gets at HT cuz you're more likely to find neighborhood locals & a crowd o'hipsters rather than any cowboys. HT is no-frills & is\u00a0dark with a bar & wooden booths & has a small stage for live bands.Nothing at HT really screams \"honkey tonk\" to me but perhaps the menu gives it southern cred! HT has a whole gamut of traditional BBQ offerings: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, sausage & the like. BBQ is my least fave food group to be honest & I really only like ribs from 1 place in Chi & 1 place in Memphis. But I was hungry so I tried food here for the first time on my last visit & got the\u00a0\"Girlfriend Salad.\" It's mixed greens with goat cheese, jicama, berries, walnuts, HT house dressing for $8 & I added BBQ chicken for $5. The salad was a big portion with ample fresh goodies & I think the chef placed a whole damn chicken on top! The chicky was very juicy & flavorful like a dry-smoked, BBQ seasoned kinda chick not drenched in BBQ sauce, thank goodness! Giddy-up! I'd eat this GF again, this was surprisingly one of the best chicken salads I've ate in awhile! The sides are a la carte so I got the small side of portobello mushrooms ($3.50) cuz I can't ever pass up a gemmy bowl o'shrooms! These guys were big & saut\u00e9ed to a crisp literally, the edges were a lil too crunchy for my preference. Good flava but ease up on the char-effect perhaps?! I also added on 1 corn muffin for $1.50. Presentation was cute but muffie was kinda cold. Kudos for bakin' it with real corn pieces inside though, was probably betta/fresha earlier that night but still tasty. I can't vouch for the ribs or other Q options at HT but based on my gemmy, BBQ chick-GF salad, I'd wager the other stuff is good too.FYI: If you're a fan of all things bacon, you're in for a treat cuz HT is known for its specialty starter, bacon candy. For $11 ya get a plate o'cut-up, caramelized, fried, crunchy bacon strips. I've tried it & I'm not a fan but lotsa peeps go hog wild over this shit!\u00a0HT has gotta a good selection of beer on tap & cool countryish, house drinks & lotsa liquor. I usually just go straight vodka but I did taste the \"Moonshine\" house cocktail ($8): It's bourbon, Veev Acai spirit, lemonade & house-made cherry. It's too sweet for my bitta blood, but I'm sure it'd only take a couple o'these & I'd be a Mello-Yello!\u00a0Last HT provides free, live musical entertainment for its patrons. The time lapse between my previous visits to HT & my most recent one has been quite awhile but if my memory serves me right, I believe there were blues-country, hillbilly rock genre kinda bands performing on past occasions. I can't be 100% certain since every time I've been to HT it's been quite\u00a0late & drinkin' straight vodka tends to blur the memory.

We came half way through the show and the people were already drinking and having a good time. We ordered the catfish dinner. The catfish was great! It was served with hot sauce and what I come to think, their home-made ketchup (YUM), the crust was crispy and the catfish meat was hot and tender, and also with a side of fries, and either potato salad or coleslaw.

\u00a0I'm no expert, but perhaps, and definitely something I've thought about going back for real soon over the last couple of days.But honestly, I can say with hardly any reservations that the Fried Chicken Sandwich was the single greatest fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. \u00a0Something I'm embarrassingly known for is my ridiculous love for fried chicken - in all forms. \u00a0Sandwich form is a good one, and while I've made great strides over the last year or so to cut more and more meat out of my diet, I still gravitate towards fried chicken when I'm out. \u00a0One of the reasons I've been able to cut more and more meat out of my eating habits is because I don't find meat eating while dining out as satisfying or necessary for a good experience as I used to.This sandwich though has flawed me and my plans to go full-on vegetarian. \u00a0It's perfectly balanced. \u00a0The chicken itself has a light, nicely seasoned breading and comes out piping hot and juicy. \u00a0A seasoned buttermilk dressing lightly slathered on a grilled bun. \u00a0A tart, slightly spicy red cabbage slaw and a side of pickled peppers add a good amount of tartness and spice. \u00a0The roll is buttery and light, yet fully holds up and contributes to the combinations of tart slaw and pickles, the smooth sauce and the chicken.I'm obsessed, and grateful that this is a lunch menu item, along with brunch on the weekends. \u00a0Comes with chips or a side salad. \u00a0$8.00. \u00a0Not that I want them to raise the price, but I'd easily pay double that for such a perfect meal.This sandwich, along with this place, and only being 1/2 block away from one of Chicago's most beautiful institutions in the conservatory is what sick days off of work are made for. \u00a0My wife and I frequently ride our bikes down Lake Street well beyond here, and we can state with certainty this specific area is nothing to be afraid of. \u00a0While I've gushed so far about the ambiance, the mission and of course the food - our service was a bit slow and labored, which is the only reason I haven't given five full stars. \u00a0We were sat at a table that was meant for a reservation, moved after being given water and so forth, and food took a long time to come out. \u00a0We didn't care in the least because our group was catching up and having a good time - but it was still something to note.For around $10/item, the food quality and experience cannot be beat anywhere in the city. \u00a0This spot is deserving of the praise and outperforms and over delivers even high expectations. \u00a0If they do half as good of a job on their mission to provide opportunities and training to the homeless and poverty-stricken as they do on their food - then this place needs to be supported to the maximum. \u00a0Something tells me they are, and for that I look forward to coming back many times over.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 4, 21]}, "8": {"description": "I had the shrimp and grits and my fianc\u00e9 had chicken and gravy.

After walking in we were absentmindedly asked to wait while they cleared some tables. They were not rude but they definitely did not have the demeanor I would expect from a full service restaurant. After being seated we were warned that they were fairly busy so the food may take a while. Which we were ok with. The problem with that is we waited at least 15+ minutes just for a drink order (we were ready to order food too but the waitress scurried away before we could). Another 10 minutes and we had our food order in. About this time a host asked us if we would move tables so they could fit a bigger group in at our table and the one next to it. Again not a big deal and we did so without problem.Then we waited about 20 more minutes for our food. And as usual the food was GREAT. Some of the best food I've tasted in Chicago. Except the tea my boyfriend ordered never showed up, nor did his toast. And we had to walk up to a host to get more water. After bringing us our food we were never checked on by the waitress... we had to walk up to the host stand where she was with everyone else working to ask for the toast. She talked to the kitchen and apologized, but the toast never actually came. Then we had to flag her down for the bill and wait another 5-10 minutes for that. And then we had to walk back up to the host stand to pay as she never came back for my card. So in short - The food was amazing. The service was beyond unacceptable. They were busy, but had empty tables and more than a few servers... who all appeared to be standing around at the register instead of checking on tables. We never got some of our food/drink, even after asking about it missing. And what should have been a 45 minute-ish dining experience at MOST turned into 70+ minutes.

After about a 30 minute wait in this 4.5 stars awarded joint we received a plate of shrimp and grits so grossly salty it made us cringe followed by a plate of nicely crisped out this outside completely raw on the inside chicken breast. When we called the waitress to show her their product the first word that came out of her mouth wasn't \" I'm so sorry\" or \"I apologize\", nope it was \"AWE HeALL\". We had to just run for the hills before catching any septic doses of salmonella. All in all this was a horrid experience and we were still in shock when we got back home a few hours later. If a restaurant can successfully screw up frying a chicken breast then it is time to consider a different line of work. May i suggest musical instruments sales.

For the first course, I had a spiced arugula salad. The cherries were a bit tart but not sweet, so it was well balanced. For the second course, I had the mushroom and farro risotto, which is actually made out of oats, I believe. The tofu was a tad sweet, but the flavors were excellent. The pecans and mushroom really added a hearty element. For my last course, I had the peach cobbler pound cake--also no complaints here. My dining companion had the crispy oysters, pepper vinegar short rib, and crunch cake. He said the short rib was better than similar dishes at more expensive restaurants.

I wish I could say that we demolished them, but as I savored each cushion-y bite, doused liberally with sauce americain, the duvet appeared to regenerate itself - miraculous indeed. In the end, I applauded myself for having eaten so well that I had no room remaining for dessert.Come heathen and patronize.

The quality of some items has been a bit uneven. For example, the brisket was great the first time my husband got it, but rubbery the second. Also they serve their jar spreads with stale crackers that look like they came out the back of someone's cupboard. The pear salad was overwhelmingly sweet and the shrimp and grits were just OK.The catfish po boy, gumbo and banana bread pudding are superb.

The ambiance was casual, sort of a no frills urban feel, which we liked. The service was absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced, at any establishment, ever. The waitress had a serious attitude problem and I could not figure out whether her face was permanantly affixed in a deranged scowl, or if she just hated life and everyone in it. She was by far the most rude, disrespectful, inattentive service worker we could have encountered. She could not describe the menu items when asked, she could not remember what we ordered, she never offered drinks of any kind, and once we got water she never offerred to refill it for us. Our order came out incorrect, and our bill was also wrong. The only reason I left any tip at all is because I would have been embaressed not to while dining with friends. Shame on Inspiration Kitchen for allowing this person to be the face of the business and treat their customers this way.

Was Completely speechless after leaving this place.. To say this is a hidden gem is an understatement. Words can not describe how Impressed we were . From the moment we pulled up the property has an outdoor garden that they pick fresh produce from to use in their dishes. The decor and ambience is super bright and welcoming. From the bright blue walls to the personalized wood. White linen napkins and a bottle of fresh cold water in glass bottles. \u00a0We were welcomed by the \u00a0Sweetest woman ever. Se was so natural and so happy that I wanted to her to sit and join us! She was super motherly \u00a0and She said I had to get the basil lemonade and the crab cake Benedict. \" holy smokes lady did I just hear you right.\" \u00a0Basil lovers be warned you will fall in love with this concoction . (Why hadn't I thought of this before. )I couldn't believe it was only $2 it went perfect with my champagne!! Oh did I say byob yet?? When my monster sized crab cake Benedict arrived I was speechless... How is this only $10 . My mom ordered the 2 egg special ( she's pretty simple.) For dessert we shared the French toast with blueberries and marscapone!! Wow, the batter was even better. When our bill came. It was less than $30 how is that possible I have no idea. So I saved the best for last. This restaurant is not just a place to eat it's an organization that trains people that are or near homelessness . Most of the money goes to support people in need and gives them a job they may not have had a chance at. \u00a0Their families also get a free meal at the restaurant. Why this place isn't packed every day is beyond me. I want to always go in and get a table but I want this place to succeed and stay open. I can only hope we have an elite yelp event here!
