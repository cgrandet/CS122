He has impeccable timing - a hello and enough time to actually review a drink list before asking. It was their \"Stout Spectacular\" so I needed a lot of time to examine the listing. The Stone chai stood out and I loved it. Picking another to follow the strong flavors though was tough for me. Luckily mike was there to decode my preferences - what do I like, did you like the chai, why don't you try this first... I took his recommendation and ordered the Pollyanna Nitro vanilla bean... So good, I ordered it twice. Good thing we had crispy, creamy Wisconsin cheese curds to shove down our gullets. They stood up to the stout and were amazing.

The portion size was definitely not what I would deem \"large\" as we were only given two pieces of fish. The meal was fine but not enough for us to share and I would've appreciated a regular tartar sauce instead of the bland tarragon remoulade that comes with this dish. Where Village Tap does shine is their carefully selected tap list which has a ton of different options and is well organized for those who are not beer experts.

She completely ignored my presence. Unfortunately, the rude and inappropriate behavior got worse.I then waited a couple more minutes and one of the other employees pointed out that I was still standing out outside. \u00a0The lady who appeared to be the manager came to the door and in a curt manner told me that the store was having system issues. \u00a0 She did not greet me, offer an apology for me standing in the cold, or offer to let me in the store which should have been opened 15 minutes prior. \u00a0 She then closed and locked the door again before I had the time to tell her I was there to pick up a balloon order. \u00a0I then had to knock on the window to tell \u00a0her that I was there to pick up balloons that we had purchased in advance and requested pickup first thing Saturday morning for a late morning party. \u00a0She paused for a second and through the locked door asked for my name. \u00a0She came back with my balloons and abruptly threw them at me through a half opened door. \u00a0They were not in a bag, nor were they weighted. \u00a0I asked for a bag and some weights as she was closing and locking the door and again she said something about the system being down. \u00a0 She walked away. \u00a0There was never any courtesy or appropriate conversation offered to me. \u00a0 I was so taken aback and insulted that I was speechless.I do not know if this issue was caused by the manager being late to open the store, the systems truly being down, or other issues that I am not privy too. \u00a0 Regardless, I was treated poorly and with a great deal of disrespect.

The bar maintains a significantly above average selection of beers relative to it's other neighborhood/corner bar competitors. What makes this place so special is the food. The food isn't fancy or anything special. It is simply regular pub food made from scratch. They use few frozen or processed ingredients. It wasn't until Sunday night when I picked up a burger to go that I realized how amazing the food truly is.

I had a burger which was quite big and cooked properly. Definitely made from scratch and not a frozen hockey puck. The toppings were fine and the bun was almost a large dinner roll. I liked it. The fries look to be handcut, but are pretty thick and were not crispy. Everything did come out hot and fresh though. Aside from the lackluster fries, I wasn't crazy about the other options on the menu. A Reuben would be an excellent addition I think. (If I missed it I'm sorry! I'll edit the review later).

They can be kind of corny at times but it adds a nice level of humor and personality to the place. I'm always excited to go back.

Why isn't there a \"no\" star rating?I have been patronizing this eatery since it opened years ago. \u00a0That was a more pleasant time with superb food, warm and welcoming staff and a place where the owners remembered your name. But then new management took over. Since that time, their overly expensive and very forgettable menu, lost me as a customer.I used to eat there once a week and then get delivery about the same. It was SO worth it! Fresh food, perfectly seasoned, great service and very knowledgeable staff. The new owners had big shoes to fill and they failed and failed some more.A week ago, I ordered food for delivery and two hours later was still waiting. I spoke to Lupe and he was apologetic and said he would return the cost of the meal, which he did. He also said that he would comp my next order. Great! So I ordered delivery last night. Carpaccio, eggplant/potato appetizers, fusili, thin crust Margherita Pizza and a cannoli. It arrived in the time promised but as soon as I opened the bag I knew this was going to be a disaster. Wrong pizza, which was a soggy salty mess laden with ingredients that had nothing to do with my order. The eggplant appetizer was totally wrong, Caprese salad was substituted for carpaccio (there was none to be had in the house), the fusili was an over cooked salty, mushy mess. In short, the entire meal was inedible. The cannoli was a cloyingly pasty puddle of goo that was obviously not fresh.When I initially called to speak with Lupe to make sure that he remembered his promise to comp my meal I was told by the phone person that he had gone home for the night, so she took the order (she was also the same employee who took my botched order several days before). When I called back to let her know about the latest order being a nightmare, I asked for Lupe and she said he was busy. What?In short, a disorganized, unknowledgeable staff, overcooked and over salted food and an eatery that thought that \u00a0it could ride the coat tails of the original owners and the stellar reputation they established.

On top of all that, I also had someone give me an arm massage while I was in the pedicure chair-- never had that done before anywhere else!! So pampered!!Adding on to the excellent pedicure, my manicure was equally as fabulous. I was offered hot tea by the owner and you can really tell they want you to feel absolutely at home while in their care. There was excellent detail to my nails and cuticles (which is a huge plus in my book as many nail salons barely focus on cuticle or just do a horrendous fast job of cutting cuticles) and also lots of friendly conversation that was had during the manicure. I had trouble initially picking out a color and the owner was very encouraging and helpful in picking out colors-- also urging me to try their newer holiday nail polish. While I waited for my nail polish to dry, I got to try their new massage chair out and i was in HEAVEN! An employee worked wonders on my back.

Got immediate service since I went in at around 11 on a weekday. (I would call ahead to be safe)Especially since it's winter time, my hands and cuticles get very dry. My cuticles often flake off. I came in for a simple mani-pedi but I got the absolute complete treatment. I was indecisive on a color and Bora helped me choose dark taupe OPI holiday seasonal. I loved how all their colors all came from OPI, China Glaze, and Essie. The massage chairs are divine. On top of that, I was given a firm leg massage while my feet were in the foot bath. I melted. Sunny started me on a paraffin wax for my dry and destroyed cuticles - the best part is that it's free until 1pm! We talked about what the cause of my excessive peeling cuticles and we concluded that it could be coming from the dry weather and the many dishes I have to wash (I work in a food lab that requires a lot of dish washing). She gave me many tips on resolving the problem at home such as warning me not to pick at them or use harsh tools on them and how to properly lotion them at night. She went on investing much more time caring for my cuticles by adding cuticle oil on them and repeatedly removing them and shaping them gently. She usually goes through the process once or twice for most, but she did it 5 or 6 times for me! My nails came out beautifully. I give my nails minimal attention on a normal basis. This was definitely one of the most beneficial mani-pedi I have ever received. It's been 2 weeks since I got my nails done and the paint still has not chipped. I've been taking care of my cuticles as they have directed and they're keeping up much better than prior. It only cost me $35.

Go elsewhere unless you want to have one of the weirdest restaurant experiences of your life, as I did:My family has been going to Thai Linda since before they changed management, so no hesitation to go back even under new ones.

We started with crispy crab and fish rolls ,which were pretty good but had a spongy quality that I wasn't expecting. Still fairly tasty.When the pad thai arrived, I discovered after one bite that this dish had NO noodles in it whatsoever. It was pad thai sauce dumped on wonton crackers and shrimp. Not at all what I wanted- who orders pad thai and says \"Hold the noodles, please\"?? \u00a0So I called our waitress over and explained that I'd like to have regular pad thai instead, since this new dish did not meet my expectations. \u00a0The waitress, who clearly spoke very little English, informed me that since I had ordered this, this is what I get to eat. \u00a0I figured she must be misunderstanding- perhaps she thought I was saying I hadn't ordered this in the first place. \u00a0So, I explained again that I just didn't care for this, and I wanted to send it back and order something different. \u00a0Again, she looked baffled- and then said \"Let me ask my manager.\" \u00a0At this point I'm thinking- I don't need a manager's permission not to like this dish. Waitress comes back and tells me that the manager says I have to pay for this since I ordered it but I can also get something else, at which point I got angry. I told her to tell her manager that I would NOT be paying for food I don't like or eat, and then asked her to just tell the manager to come and speak to me directly.She comes back AGAIN and says \"My manager will give you half off this dish. But you cannot change.\" \u00a0Now there's steam shooting out of my ears. I stood up, walked into the restaurant with the plate of (now soggy) wonton crackers and sauce, thunked it down on the counter, and said loudly, \"Tell your manager to come out of the kitchen and speak to me, please.\" And then I stood at the counter and waited. Waitress tells me she's on the phone. I still stand there. Waitress comes out for the FOURTH time and now says, \"OK, we will take this off and you want regular pad thai?\" \u00a0I say yes and go back outside. Quite possibly the oddest thing that's ever happened to me- I actually had to pick up my plate and practically threaten to walk it back into the kitchen myself to stress the point that I would not be forced into eating a crappy dish or paying for it. \u00a0So don't bother going to Thai Linda, unless you are absolutely sure you are going to love whatever the hell they put down in front of you.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 8, 15]}, "45": {"description": "The food and service here was great.

First and foremost, the owners are the nicest people I have ever met. \u00a0They love to talk to their customers, to find out who they are and what they need. And they certainly love all different types of people with all different sorts of lifestyles (I heard, like another reviewer did, about Greg's alter- ego Amanda). They want you to find the best shoes for you and will help you find one that you can walk in at least semi comfortably.Another reason you should go here: I'd say between 80-90% of their shoes are made in the good ole US of A, hand crafted in California. This allows them to make custom shoes: half sizes, large sizes, custom colors, etc. This is also why their shoes are a bit more expensive than ones you'll find at Sunny's or another cheap stripper shoe store; most of those shoes are made in China. So you can count on getting sweatshop free shoes! Ethics are always a plus!They also sell custom corsets. You only live once and life is too short to not splurge on a well made corset that will make you look HOT!This place is too wonderful to go out of business and let's face it, we ALL need at least one corset and at least one pair of stripper shoes (it's a fact and it's really not up for discussion).

An extra glass of wine was accidentally brought out with the first round of drinks (which took another 10+ minutes) and when we pointed out the error it was taken away but still appeared on our bill. Appetizer order of pretzels took another 20+ minutes and arrived completely cold/soggy. Had to flag a different waiter (ours had disappeared) to send it back. Took nearly an hour from the time we were seated for our meals to arrive, and the most simple meal of the group, a house salad, was never delivered. Had to walk around the restaurant and hunt down our waitress to let her know we were missing something. Again - had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find our waitress to bring the check, then find her (again) to remove the extra wine charge. All in all we spent an hour and a half there and had to go find someone every time we wanted anything - not acceptable for a place serving easy/basic bar food that was not even remotely crowded.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 4, 17]}, "34": {"description": "Food's amazing.

I ordered for delivery through Grub Hub. The chicken in the chicken strips were good, but burnt, as though they left them in the fryer for too long. The bacon on the burger was soggy, and the bread fell apart in my hands too easily. Finally, they forgot to put the side of cheese for my cheese fries. I tried the fries before even calling and they just had no flavor. Maybe not enough spices, if any. I called Grub Hub to let them know I was missing the cheese, and they called back saying that when they advised the restaurant about it, the owner said he had bagged it up himself and he knows he put the side of cheese in there. Grub Hub very kindly offered me free grub, but when I hung up, I got to thinking, that it most likely wasn't the Grub Hub driver's fault. The bag was large enough to have all the food fit comfortably in there, and there was more than enough room for a side of cheese. Also, the bag was stapled shut when I received it. I decide to call the restaurant, and I spoke with a man named Jose, who stated he was the cook. I proceeded to tell him about the situation, and he 'kindly' interrupts me and says he doesn't know what happened, because he bagged it himself and he KNOWS he put the cheese in there, but that he can send someone to deliver the cheese to me. I explained to him the fries have already been thrown away so there would be no point in getting the cheese at this point, and he says he'll send me over the fries as well. At this point I'm not as starving as I was before I got the food, and I simply wanted a refund for the cheese fries. He said something along the lines of, \"Call Grub Hub for a refund. We can't do anything about it, except send you some more fries.\" Being in the restaurant industry myself, this is already something I would personally be highly upset about if one of my employees had responded to a customer in this way. I remembered the Grub Hub representative telling me that she had spoken with the 'owner' and that the 'owner' had bagged up my order himself, so I asked Jose if he was the owner, and he said no, he was simply the cook. So I immediately asked to speak with a supervisor or someone above him, and he said no one was there except him and no one would be there until 10pm. That explains why this restaurant may not be doing so well. I left my information and asked him to have them contact me as son as they could. I'm more than positive I'm not getting a phone call from them, and if I do, they'll most likely have the same response I got from this cook, Jose. Honestly, it wasn't the worst food ever, but in hindsight, I should've just gone to McDonald's to avoid all this disappointing mess. Mediocre food, plus awful customer service, doesn't belong in Chicago. I would give this place a second chance, but I feel like they're already set in their ways.

The server gets another table seated up front, and a food runner brings our order out- to the couple in the booth next to us. Our server goes to check on how their food is, and they inform him that it isn't what they ordered. The server looks slightly panicked and then looks at us (and yes we can clearly hear this exchange of events). He asks the couple if they had touched the plates, they say yes and they're sorry..... He proceeds to pick up the plates and then set them down in front of us while promising that the other couple \"NEVER touched the plates\"..... I'm pregnant, and I was hungry enough to eat my own arm off, so we didn't say anything to our waiter about the mix up right then and there, but in retrospect, we should have. I used to wait tables, and understand that mistakes happen- but his bold face lie about the fact that the other couple had never touched the plates when we could clearly hear that they had was not only a sanitation issue, but completely unprofessional as well. I would've rather waited for a plate that hadn't been touched on by others. The food was decent, but his plate was served to us with regular french fries instead of chips, and the burgers were both ordered medium, and cooked well.

I am an absolute Die Hard Cowboys fan from the tiny little town of Alvarado, Tx. Prime Cowboys country. I grew up watching the triplets win super bowls, and literally every person you see wears the Star. Its almost a religion. On 9/20/2015 I attempted to get a party of 5 Cowboys/ 2 Eagles/ 1 bears fan to hang out in my favorite place to watch the Cowboys in Chicago. Friends in rivalry right? Wrong. When we arrived one of our Cowboys friends already had a table going for us and came up and was hugging one of our Eagles friends and coworkers, who just moved here, and know nothing about Chicago. No sooner did that happen than the organizer, who I'm not sure even owns the bar, came off his high horse for a minute to accost our friends. Immediate disrespectful pointing to get out, cursing, name calling, threw a 20 at our friend, which got ripped up and rightfully so. We don't need your money we make plenty. Im confused though. I have seen Bears fans inside before, and while this was going on a Steelers fan and a REdskins fan were inside the bar. Any cowboys fans know those are our biggest rivals. After my initial feelings on the situation and leaving for another bar I was just going to let it go. But the group \"Dallas Cowboys Fans in Chicago\" has not. Even Today, 8 days later. \u00a0Continues to press about the situation publicly, posting photos and bragging about how Douche bag eagles are. When I let him in on maybe some things he didn't know, he bans me from his page so he doesn't dig a deeper hole and removes all the pictures and trash talk because I quote \"it was getting ugly for him\" All I did was let him know what he did. The negative feedback on his screenshot of Duane A.'s yelp review with his added thoughts to the post, caused him to take it down. This bar. Good food. Bad organizer, unbelievably bad sportsmanship. He claims that the Eagles fans would start a fight. Nah, these two would have shaken your hand on the way out if they had been treated like people and allowed to stay with their friends who invited them and wanted them to know what it feels like to be in a sea of Cowboys...The Noise, the passion we bring. Unfortunately Commonwealth failed really hard this time. Its hospitality not war. You are a bar, with food and drink. Usually a place friends can be just that. Not today. There are some great Cowboys fans in Chicago but this organizer doesn't deserve to call himself one. He certainly did not act like one. He is not one of us.

This was a combination of server and bartender issues, because that server was not the one to get the glass. \u00a0Either you need more glassware behind the bar so you aren't running out (which I hope is the excuse), or you need to train your staff that serving piping hot glasses for cold beverages is not acceptable.TLDR: TRAIN YOUR STAFF. \u00a0These are basic problems with one simple solution: train people. \u00a0If you don't know how to run a restaurant, find yourself a manager who does and have them teach your people the basics.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 11, 15]}, "18": {"description": "Went for brunch.

The red snapper, which isn't my favorite fish, was perfect and the mango cilantro salsa was a fresh compliment. The scallops, which are easy to over cook, were like butter. The shrimp & prawns were okay. We didn't get any chimichurri or dipping sauce, which I didn't know was part of the dish until I looked at the menu online. But the biggest surprise was the bill. I wasn't wearing my reading glasses while ordering but grabbed the check when it came. The surf n turf for 2 was $70. My hubby thought the menu said $36. I think the price point belongs somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. With tax & tip we dropped $100 with no alcohol.

We were by the bar and my cousin was trying to order some drinks, but for some reason couldn't place the order, he handed me his card and said \"here you order, this guy's not going to take my order.\" He was speaking about the bartender, which I believe his name was Julio. Long story short I think he might have bothered Julio, not sure maybe if my cousin wasn't ready with his order or didn't know how to order, since it was Saturday, maybe the bartender thought my cousin was wasting his time. My cousin has a distinct personality so maybe he rubbed the bartender the wrong way, regardless now I was going to try to order. I saw the bartender was busy, but did try to let him know I wanted to order. He clearly saw me, but once again I was aware he was making drinks already, so I figured I'd wait, while I'm waiting he knocks down a cup filled with those cocktail mixers and crushers with what I'm assuming was water mixed with residue of drinks. Luckily I was paying attention and stepped back but some did manage to spill on my shirt. Julio the bartender proceeds to keep mixing the drink and doesn't bother giving me a rag, napkins or even picking up the cup. I grab my own napkins put some on the counter to stop the leakage off the counter and to dry my shirt. My cousin then goes to pick up the cup which was still just laying on the counter and then the bartender reaches for the cup and napkins, my cousin then tells him, \"you know you knocked this down and it spilled on my cousin\", the bartender glances at me and answers back \"Ok and? What do you want me to do?\" My cousin then says \"well you could at least start by apologizing\" the bartender then looks at me unapologetically and gives me the most fake apology of my life. That was probably the worst service I've ever had at a bar. Needless to say we didn't order anything from him. I probably won't be going back to blue light anytime soon.

I searched far and wide for a nail spot to give me quality sculpted nails ( UV gels). You can get them as an overlay over your actual nail length or you can get them a little longer. The salon also does regular manicures, gel manicures, pedicures, spa pedicures. First, the place is beautiful. I am not easily scared off- sometimes those hole in the wall spots give you the best manicure- but the salon's d\u00e9cor is on point and I had to take note. It's spacious and has enough seating. They use quality polishes like OPI and Essie and have a great color range.Now for the best part- there is only one person who does the sculpted nails and he is amazing. This means you cant just walk in for sculpted nails but he surprisingly squeezes you in for last minute appointments. You know how nails grow out and there is the bump between your nail bed and the gel? Avka's technique is so flat at the base of the nail that they grow out without any bumps. That means you can rock these for so much longer without them looking terrible. You can change the polish and cover the base of your nail that has grown out. I should also mention that these gels are crystal clear. Like glass. A lot of places tell you you're getting UV gel and the color of them is clear but with a faint white tint. It's usually inferior product or even mixed with some acrylic. The gel used here is the clearest I've ever seen. So much so that you could rock these nails with just clear polish if you wanted to.When I first walked in and Avka told me my nails would last at least 3 weeks I politely smiled and thought to myself, ummm nah, not happening. He was absolutely right. I'd say they last around 4 weeks but probably best to come in at around week 3.And the price is on point.

He insisted I come back in so he could re-do them for free.Naturally, I felt bad because I know with certain places people can maybe just have an off day and it wasn't my intention to get anything free out of it.

You can easily zip through the racks, as they are so well presented...The owner is knowledgeable, and has been open for 17 years...before Roscoe Village was hip, hip, hip and home to the stroller set. Been in biz that long selling second hand? Must know some tricks of the trade. Yeah, awesome vintage stuff + not overpriced. We have a winner!Prices: VERY reasonable. Dresses range from about $18-$35. In pristine condition...ain't no mothballs up in here! Everything is clearly marked with pricing, sizing, measurements, era. I got a hair clip for $1, necklace/earrings set for $12 and a really cute scarf/tie for $4. I mean, really...those are downright Brown Elephant prices, but you don't have to wade through piles of Forever 21 rejects. Accessories: SCORE! Sunglasses galore, hair stuff, hats, gloves, tights, shoes...you name it. Parking to the east of Damen on Roscoe is non-metered, non-permit...so park yourself, and enjoy...(hehe, ps...their mannequins had breathing masks on a la swine flu. some of the best window decor in the city!)", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 5, 8]}, "26": {"description": "There is nothing I can say that has not already been said about how fabulous this store is!!! \u00a0It seems as though the owner spends a great deal of time handpicking each item he sells in the store. \u00a0I have gone here a few times and have never been disappointed or spent a ton of money. \u00a0I feel like what Im purchasing is clean, solid, and reasonably priced.This is more than a thrift store, this a vintage clothing store that sells amazing pieces. \u00a0If you are looking to pop in here and spend $5.00 on 20 things this is not the place for you. \u00a0If you are looking for really amazing pieces of clothing that are truly vintage and/or original then I totally recommend this place to you.", "rating": "5", "date": [2010, 9, 21]}, "25": {"description": "Shangri-La is too cool.

Everything was delicious... we started (and shared) a feta salad with a nice greek style dressing and the caprese which had a burrata centerpiece (mmmm). For our dinner we shared the Iskender, which is doner (picture gyro meat) over toasted bread, yogurt, tomato puree. It was soooo good. We also shared stuffed mini-eggplants - the stuffing was a mix of veggies. It was so tender and flavorful. We were too stuffed for desert, which was a shame.Service and atmosphere are fine. It would be a cute spot for a date night. The service was not especially attentive, it reminded me more of service you would find outside of the US.

We were seated by the aisle and usually this bugs me, but servers were very observant to not nudge or bump into me. Although our server looked like my former evil boss, I tried to not hold it against her as she was really prompt and helpful when we had questions. We order 2 glasses of Pinot noir and while they were decent, they required breathing to be drinkable. Maybe they just opened this bottle? Idk. They were very tangy at first. Decent but drinkable later. We received the complimentary bread which was definitely the best freaking bread I've had in a while. Took all my strength to not eat a whole loaf. We ordered mujver since yelp told me to and it was exquisite. Not too heavily breaded to overstuff you, and the sauce was the boss. I had the salmon that came with gnocchi. Salmon was just ok, same taste as store bought. So much gnocchi in this dish, I had to box it up for another day. Gnocchi was also standard. He had the yogurt kabap which was the same sauce as the mujver but with lamb. He loved it. From the looks of the menu and reviews, this is definitely more of a lamb-driven spot. It seems the most popular dishes are lamb and that's all good. It's just not the spot I'm really gonna enjoy most.

I needed to use the bathroom so she told me to undress, put a towel on, and she would show me to the bathroom. Weird, I thought, so I'm just gonna walk shirtless in a towel to the bathroom I guess.She leads me to the bathroom and says \"you take steam shower\" I was like, \"aahh...ok?\" she then set up a towel on the bench in the shower and turned the steam on. Ok, this is a nice amenity I thought. But she just left after that. No instruction. How long do I stay in here? 5 mins? 20? Is this cutting into my hour massage time? I stayed for 5 mins then sheepishly tip toed in my towel back to my room.I met my massage therapist and tried to have a consultation with her about my bad lower back and how I'd like her to spend extra time on it. She cut me short and said just lay down and well talk after that, so I did. But we didn't talk after that. She just started massaging me-and not a deep tissue massage, but a swedish massage. I asked her if she could 'find the knots' and 'apply more pressure' as that is what a deep tissue massage therapist would normally do. Her reply was that a deep tissue massage was the same as a swedish, just harder...what?! That's completely false! Any trained professional would tell you that. They are completely different techniques. Google it for goodness sakes! Then the phone range at the front desk. She stopped massaging immediately and said \"sorry!\" as she was leaving the room to go answer the phone. This is when I got up, got dressed, walked to the front and demanded a refund. She had been 'massaging' me for a total of 10 mins so she said she would only charge me $20. I told her no, I paid for a service and I did not receive that service so I would like a full refund. Her counter offer was to only charge me $10. I just said screw it, received a partial refund, and left with a still aching lower back.

She says any substation costs $2. So we ask how can you charge us extra for something when the original item isn't available? She said yes I told you you can have vegetable. OK. So we want sweet potato. OK but I have to charge you extra. I draw a blank. She claims that this is the rule and that she cannot substitute it. Fine. I then order my pad thai and we sit kind of confused as to what is up with this woman.Our appetizers come out, my aunt (bento box) doesn't get her miso soup. We figure the lady must have forgot. Then the entrees are brought out, guess what? No bento box for my aunt. Waitress claims we cancelled that. Not once did we say that we didn't want the bento box. My aunt then says please just bring me beef and broccoli, it comes with an appetizer right? Waitress says no (mind you ordering from the lunch menu), so my aunt just says beef and broccoli is fine. She brings out a supposed \"dinner portion\" of the beef and broccoli which is the same size as the one served for lunch, no one asked for the entree portion, we noticed it on the bill. When she brought the bill we asked and she claimed thats what we wanted. My aunt told her that she didn't understand us from the beginning. This experience is absolutely ridiculous and although their food is great, I cannot get past the horrible service. I will not return. I will go back to the Irving Location and pray that all goes well there.I have visited this location many times and usually have an ok experience, but this was just ridiculous. The three of us were so irritated we hardly touched our lunch and of course didn't leave her a cent of a tip. Feel we wasted $30 on a terrible lunch experience!

He too has curly locks and he GETS IT.Since then, he's trimmed, thinned, colored and chopped off almost all my hair (Locks of Love), always with a great result. Friends and strangers alike often ask me what products I use, who cuts my hair, etc... And I attribute this to Tip's handiwork.

Unfortunately, it has been about a week since I went in to redeem the certificate, and I can say that I am overall disappointed with the entire experience. I think sometimes, when you buy deals to places, they treat you as if you're not a full-paying customer, which is really not good business sense.Day-of: The lash lounge is small and looks rather unprofessional, but this is only a minor complaint. Anna (not the owner, Olivia) did my extensions. She did an okay job. I think I may have been a challenging client because my lashes are naturally not long, thick or curly (but that's the point of wanting extensions, right?). After an hour or so of lying on the table/dozing off, I was excited to open my eyes and see my new luxurious lashes. I wasn't astounded with the result. The extensions looked relatively natural and subtle, but also unruly and not the transformation I expected. It just looked like some of my lashes were randomly a bit longer. So, they looked nice, but I would not pay upwards of $300 to get them done again. Then, it was time for my eyebrow wax, which I had to keep reminding them the certificate included. Olivia did this for me, but it was very - for lack of a better word - half-assed. She did some basic, non-detailed waxing and finished with a few tweezer plucks. I expressed some annoyance with one of my brows that always refuses to cooperate, and she was like, \"oh let me show you this,\" as if she was going to perform some sort of magic. She just brought out an eyebrow shaping makeup kit that I already use everyday. And it didn't really make much of a difference. In fact, with her broad strokes, she made one of my brows look a little trannylicious. Also to be honest, Olivia's lashes and makeup job looked kinda messy. Not a good thing to notice about the owner. Anyway, I left decently satisfied, but a little put off by the owner's attitude and the overall vibe in the lounge.Aftercare: I was told my eyes couldn't come in contact with liquid for 24 hours. This is extremely difficult in sweaty summertime, but I won't whine too much about it. Even after this liquid ban, the extensions take a while to get used to. They get in the way when you wash your face, and are pretty annoying to deal with because you don't want to mess them up. Also, they just started to look increasingly unruly. I noticed a few lashes that were stuck together and some that were crazy long. To get the look I want, I still have to wear eyeliner, and I want to wear mascara, which kind of defeats the purpose. Furthermore, they really do not last very long. It's been about a week, and I probably have about 15% of the original lashes left. To sum up, maybe I'm just not meant to have long, thick lashes. At the same time, I thought Chicago Lash Lounge would be the kind of place that strives to change that belief. Instead, I realize that they are just a small, boutique place offering (overpriced) luxury services in a subpar space/atmosphere.", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 8, 3]}, "23": {"description": "I bought a Gilt City deal for natural lashes on a whim - without checking the ratings for the business on Yelp first, which I usually do. \u00a0After reading through the reviews, I panicked but the Gilt City voucher was pretty clear about no refunds.So, I made an appointment for the service, and was actually very pleasantly surprised by the experience. \u00a0Parking was easy, the store itself didn't look that untidy or dirty, and there was a receptionist who was friendly and helpful. \u00a0Isabelle was the technician who did my lashes - she is AMAZING. \u00a0The lashes turn out looking really natural and fabulous (much better than at Lashe Spot), and she is super sweet.

I googled this place and saw that CBS voted them as one of the best places in Chicago to get eyelash extensions so that's what drew me in. Since I only ever used the glue on strip lashes, I was ready for a change and wanted to experience what the eyelash extension craze was all about for myself! When I called to book an appointment, I was fortunate enough to speak to Olivia (Liv) the owner of the salon. Immediately, I expressed my concerns about getting eyelash extensions for the first time, but Liv reassured me that I was in good hands. Liv explained how she has been doing this for several years and I was impressed to learn she trained in Hollywood with celebrity artists on how to do eyelash extensions. On the day of my appointment, it was easy to find the salon's location and there was so much free parking on the street. I arrived a few minutes early, so Liv politely informed me she was finishing up with a client and would be with me shortly. As I sat and waited, I couldn't help but admire the design and layout of this salon! All of the furniture, artwork, and wall designs that decorate this place are so fashionable and chic! The salon really nailed it when setting the perfect ambiance for something as glamourous as getting eyelash extensions. The pink walls are awesome!Soon, Liv was ready to see me and directed me to the private room where eyelash extensions are applied. There, I felt more of the same modern vibes as the rest of the salon and as I settled onto the comfortable chair, I noticed the room was very neat and clean. Liv then proceeded to ask me what type of eyelashes I was looking to get, and this being my first eyelash experience, she made sure to hear me out, ask me all the right questions, and really understand what I wanted before she started. I even showed her pictures from my phone that were examples of how I wanted my lashes to look, and she was so patient and understanding! Once she knew I was comfortable and confident with what I chose for myself, Liv started applying my eyelash extensions one strand at a time.Liv worked diligently and thoroughly for two hours, but time flew by so fast. Liv is exactly the type of person you would want to have if you could not move during a 2 hour process of getting eyelash extensions. She is so friendly and makes sure you are very comfortable the whole time. Not only does Liv answer every question under the sun that you could possibly think of about eyelash extensions, how to maintain them, what kind of mascara to use on them, which makeup removers are safe etc., but she also takes the time to explain to you what she is doing as she goes along. We ended up talking about anything and everything, and she made me feel so at ease.I was amazed and so happy when I saw my eyelashes! I always wanted thick, long eyelashes and Liv was able to make that happen while making my eyelashes look so natural. It's amazing what a difference fuller eyelashes make in beautifying your eyes! Plus, with the eyelash strips from drugstores you can usually see the glue and feel the lashes on your eyes the whole time, but not with Liv's eyelash extensions. You cannot see the glue at all and it doesn't even feel like you have extensions on.The day after getting my eyelash extensions, I flew out to Asia for vacation and despite the humidity, my eyelashes remained intact for a month without falling out or budging. Having these extensions cut my makeup time in half since I didn't have to apply so many coats of mascara every day. I am so satisfied with my decision to go to Liv Lash Boutique for my first ever eyelash extensions and will definitely be going back to Liv in the future.

I never knew there was so much expertise that goes into something like this. Olivia really knows what she's talking about as she also teaches other people how to do eyelash extensions. It is a very tedious task as each lash extension is glued onto each of your own lashes. (Be aware, if you have been going elsewhere and they are gluing the lashes to your eyelids, this is WRONG! Fortunately, Olivia will be able to correct that for you.)She recently opened her very cute store on Belmont with private lash rooms. I feel that getting lash extension is a very intimate process and I would hate to be in an open room where everyone can hear your conversation and see you get your lashes done at the same time.

I became so frustrated with past artisits, that I went on a 2 year hiatis from lash extensions. But once I did extensive research, found Olivia online, and visited her for the first time over a year ago, I KNEW the lash God's had answered my prayers!!OMG!!! I have never seen such gorgeous, realistic lash extensions before, and I was lucky enough to call them my own! Over a year later, I still cannot stop staring at my lashes in the mirror in amazement! Olivia's work is so wonderfully and meticulously done, sometimes I forget myself these lases did not grow out of my eyelids!! I have received tons of compliments on my lashes, and I get so excited about passing along Olivia's contact information, and singing her praises whenever I have the chance. And mostly because I want so many of fellow lash loving ladies out there to allow themselves such an experience! Ladies, please stop abusing and damaging your natural lashes with the heavy, poor quality lashes and adhesive being applied to your lashes either in the 'one stop shops' for cheap, or the overly priced, less than qualified technicians in the uppity shops. I know that you are either losing your own lashes, or leaving these shops broke, and less than fully satisfied. And believe me, I know, because I have been in both of these situations on more occasions than I wsh to recall, before finding Olivia! Olivia takes many things into consideration before applying your lashes. The weight that your natural lashes can hold, the shape of your eyes, so that she can apply the lashes in a way to best compliment your eyes, the price range your are looking to stay within, the duration of time you are looking to keep your lashes for, your comfort level while having the lashes applied, and how to work with the characteristics of different ethnicities' lashes, as I am an African American woman, and our lashes tend to be extremely curly, bushy, and like to criss cross with each other, but her expertise allows this not to be an issue during application and the wearing of the \u00a0 extensions! Olivia has opened up an ADORABLE lash lounge in a great location, with easy free parking, and a great staff. She not only provides a wonderful service here, but offers a full maintence product line for your lashes, along with other fabulous services!

I visited the Liv Lash Boutique on three occasions: November, 2015, December, 2015, and February, 2016. Let me first say that Liv knows what she's doing. She has a steady hand and good technique. The lashes on all three occasions turned out great. It was everything else that prompted me to write this review and probably not return (which is a shame). I worked at a cosmetology school for three years. Part of what I was around were theory classes and state board prep classes for the students. Sanitation 101 is that you don't reuse things on multiple people. The covering on the headrest, the blankets and the pillows are all reused from client to client. For example, I went into the room directly after another girl left and put my head and body on the same stuff she had been laying on. Ew. The tools are the same. The tools are set out in a cute fashion - all in cute little holders. However, again, the instruments I had used on me seemed to have been laying there from the last client. It's a really cute concept and I really wanted to spend my money at a local business but it needs some work. I hate to be a negative person; it's not who I am and I think spreading negativity hurts everyone in the end. After that disclaimer - the owner is larger than life - which is great if she's your girlfriend and you need someone to go clubbing or get over an ex, but not if you're looking for a nice, professional, spa-like experience. She constantly talks about herself - like she has to fill the silence - and will interrupt you 100% of the time if you start to say something, even if you're asking her about her other services or packages. Her conversation topics are what everyone else mentioned on YELP and half of them are totally inappropriate. \u00a0I think she said the word \"titties\" at least 12 times when I was last there. The first time I was there, she trash-talked her competition, who I guess tried to sue her over trademark or copyright infringement or something and she was forced to change her name. Talking about stuff like that is not appropriate and makes someone seem bitter and unprofessional. She bad-mouthed other clients in front of me and another client saying that they had some nerve to try and get in with 24-hr notice (this is a good problem to have, Liv) and stated that it was rude and pushy and they should know she was busy. And then she threw her cell phone on the counter.While working on me, I had a little twitch - you know - like a cold shiver. Her reaction was \"Great. You just made me loose five lashes. I love what I do but sometimes my clients make me want to throw my tweezers across the room.\" I was stunned and wanted to cry at that point.

It was disruptive, obnoxious and not the relaxing experience I was looking for. I think this was also the cause of some of my lashes not put on very well. I was told at the end of my appointment that she was going to allow me to come back for a free touch-up of the lashes. When I came back, another girl did my lashes and we were the only ones in the place. Then she went on about how much she hated working there and what a horrible job Olivia did on my lashes. She even said she was going to remove some of them and re-apply it for me for no extra charge because she felt bad about how bad it was.

I came home and looked them up on line, and realized this would be a new obsession. Here they do lash extensions, which is an individual hair bonded to your own eyelash. Not like the ones you can buy that are clumps of two or three hairs and applied with glue. This is exactly what I needed! No more eyelash strips folding up, or glue getting in my eye when it rains!I did my due diligence to make sure I found the best place. \u00a0I was shocked at how much lower the prices are here. \u00a0At Flutter lash studio, a full set of mascara look lashes will run you about $500 if not more. \u00a0I read that the up keep for lash extensions is pretty simple, but you need to get them refilled, because they shed out with your natural lashes. \u00a0So, I have to pay $500, only for one service, and then try to find some more money to get them refilled every 3 or so weeks? Ouch. At Chicago lash lounge, I got a full set of mascara style lashes (they are thick and tinted black so I never have to wear mascara!!) and two refill sessions for well under $300! I couldn't believe the difference in price. \u00a0My experience was wonderful. The shop is so cute!

The manicure was bad. \u00a0Just bad. \u00a0I have shorter nails and had to ask for the nails to be straightened out as they were filed REALLY crooked. \u00a0There were few polish option, almost all were old or really tacky colors.

The food was honestly forgettable, I can't even remember what I had. My husband had some sort of scramble which he said was okay.Perhaps our server was having an \"off\" day (as a former server, I know that these days can happen and sometimes you take it out on your tables) but she was nothing but flat-out rude from the get-go. My husband had a few substitutions he wanted for his dish, and as he was explaining this to the server she held her finger up in his face and said brusquely \"uh, can you GIVE me a minute?\" and scribbled on her pad. These were not complicated subs. It was one ingredient substitution and one ingredient he didn't want. This was nothing out of the ordinary, and nowhere on the menu do they say \"no substitutions.\"So, we place our order but I was just completely soured on this woman. For a place that's trying to send across a peaceful, Zen-like vibe, this woman was whatever the opposite of that vibe is. She then proceeded to disappear for about 20 minutes, during which our food was sitting up on the counter under the heat lamps. We were this close to getting up and just getting the damn food ourselves instead of waiting for this woman to reappear.Reappear she did, eventually, reeking of cigarettes, and dropped our food off. No apologies, no asking if we needed anything else, just dropped the food at the table and walked away. I try to make it a practice to give each server I encounter the benefit of the doubt, particularly if it's clearly slammed in the restaurant, if the place seems understaffed, or if we have a large party or complicated orders. All these factors tend to rub servers the wrong way or put them in a bad mood. I can even accept neglectful service as long as the server recognizes it eventually, or even gives an explanation.

We found a free parking space which was flabbergasting considering the previous parking adventures. It was still quite early and this might have explained that. We were warmly greeted by a young woman wearing a sari. There were just a couple of tables were occupied so we were able to choose one of our liking.While waiting for someone to take our order, a young man came and dropped a book and a couple of toys next to my son. He introduced himself as Bobby and was really friendly and interested by our family's origins. (My wife is from Trinidad and from Indian descent). The menu was pretty varied but I went for a sausage and Gouda omelet. My son went for the pancakes and a side order of sausage, my daughter for the chocolate chip waffle but my wife went for the Uppama. According to the menu, it's \"a savory hot cereal with peas, tomatoes and onions, served with coconut chutney and yogurt.\" The kids and I got our food pretty quickly but the Uppama was taking time and it so happened that with Bobby's interest in our family, he forgot to put in the order. When he realized what had happened, he came to apologize and said it would be on the house to make up for his mistake. It was finally served and it was most interesting but the chutney was absolutely delicious. My son did not like his sausage and we found out afterwards that it wasn't meat but a veggie-based sausage (of course!) . The place filled up pretty quickly a sign that the place was worthy of its reputation and there was a line already building up at the door.

I believe he bought some of the Heck family recipes, as there are items at Rudy's which I remember from the Heck days.

The Colonel just can't hang in my book. With that being said, this location in particular is a huge disappointment to the otherwise stellar reputation of the brand. I was leaving Wrigley after a game and heading back to hop on 90 to head back to the burbs when I saw the sign and just had to stop. I just wanted to grab something quick to go, but quick did not turn out to be a word in the employees of this location's vocabulary. It was a solid \u00a020 min wait from the time I ordered until I finally got my box. Even if they had to bread it on the spot and throw it in the fryer, it should not have taken nearly so long. I think the clerk might have been pissed off at me since I stopped in relatively close to closing time for the dining room, as he was giving me some pretty serious attitude. I have an aversion to any drive-thru. OK, dude, I get it. You obviously hate your job, and you hate me because I am forcing you to do it. Perhaps a line of work that does not involve customer service is more your speed. How about being a guinea pig for some pharmaceutical company? Needless to say, I was relieved when I finally got my box so I could leave. I polished off my 2 piece spicy with cajun fries and a biscuit while speeding down I-90 at 85 MPH. This is not an easy feat to pull off, but I am somewhat of a professional. As for the food?Chicken: Extremely greasy. Eating it made me feel like I had just been making out with Miss Piggy. Also poorly breaded and prepared. Pretty much the entire skin fell off after the first bite. Part of the cool factor of Popeye's (and fried chicken in general) is that nice crunch to contrast with the succulent nature of the meat. The skin here would only be useful if I was trying to pull off a \"Hello Clarice\" impersonation. \u00a0I ate it because I was extremely hungry, but even that was a mistake. Fries: About like trying to eat seasoned cardboard. I could not finish them. They were WAY over-seasoned and hard as a rock. I dumped them out the window. I hope the person behind me on the highway did not have their windshield damaged from a projectile fry. Biscuit: The one and only redeeming quality. It was actually really good, which shocked the hell out of me since everything else was so awful.

Unfortunately it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Food and service both were shockingly bad. Details below...Upon arrival for our 8:15 reservation, we were taken by a seemingly flustered hostess to a tent-like enclosed patio. Not exactly what we expected given the sub-zero windchills last night. This proved problematic as the restaurant's attempts to heat the tent caused quite a bit of condensation which, unbeknownst to us at the time, soaked our personal belongings over the course of our meal.We all four ordered a three course prix fixe special NYE offering. Two of us added pairings, while the other two ordered drinks a la carte. We received our first wines without food, which would become a common theme on the night. It was a good 20 minutes until the first course actually arrived, effectively nullifying the idea of pairings since I had already finished my wine by this point.My strangely giant portion of mushroom soup finally arrived, lukewarm at best. Despite the huge serving, the soup was served with a small teaspoon. If I had tried to finish it, I would probably still be eating it. While powering through this course, my second wine showed up with no explanation.We sat for another 30 minutes waiting for the second course to arrive. It eventually did - my pork belly was edible but nothing to write home about. Two people ordered the rack of lamb. One was served barely rare, while the other came out beyond well-done. Around this time the waitress noticed that my wife's second drink, ordered about 20 minutes ago, had not yet been delivered. Rather than apologizing or saying she would check on it, she simply walked off after saying \"Well, it's been ordered.\" This was a fairly common theme on the night...I'm not sure if the waitress was embarrassed at the fact that the restaurant was so clearly in the weeds (I didn't see a happy face in the entire place - staff or diner), but she seemed to avoid our table at all costs.Up next was the longest wait of the night as we waited about 40 minutes for dessert. As expected, the dessert wine came about halfway through this wait and I polished it off well before dessert actually showed up. We had been pretty patient all night but finally one of asked if the desserts were on their way. The waitress replied with \"yes, everything is backed up tonight.\" No apology at all.Dessert finally showed up, and it was the worst course of the night. My profiteroles tasted like sawdust - I took one bite and was finished. We sat staring at our food for another 15 minutes or so until I got up and asked the waitress to kindly bring us our check. She dropped it off a few minutes later with a simple thank you, and no acknowledgement of the fact that we all knew it had been an absolutely horrible experience. Ironically, when the reservation was made we were told there was a hard 2 hour cap on our reservation and we would be kicked out promptly at 10:15. By no fault of our own we left at 10:45.$350 later we left the restaurant feeling ripped off and still hungry. Honestly if they had made some effort to at least apologize, acknowledge the situation, or thrown us a bone in the form of a free round of drinks or something, I could write this off as a place not prepared to handle a NYE situation and give them another shot.

We rented out the outdoor garden area and had about 60 guests. The venue was very intimate and we received multiple compliments from our guests. Many wondered how we had found the place. More than the venue the service at Volo was amazing. From the moment we first emailed, April was very responsive and never took more than 24 hours to respond to our requests. She coordinates all the events at Volo and did a fantastic job making sure all of our details were taken care of. The staff also immediately made us feel at home. It felt like we were a part of the Volo family. Now, the food. It is something that cannot be ignored. The chef, Steven, has such a passion for blending unique flavors. It is not your traditional wedding food, which was exactly what we wanted. Everything is served buffet style with small plates instead of a large entree type meal. Another big plus is the drink options, we got the beer and wine package and they were great about accommodating our request for local IPA brews at no additional charge. Overall, we could not have been happier with Volo. If you are thinking about having a small intimate wedding in the city at least check this place out. It was beautiful and made our wedding day one to remember.

And we ordered the filet plate and yeah, I have never had to chew a piece of \"filet\" that many times in my life. That was a total letdown. Finally, the biggest issue I had here is the price. It's just too expensive for what you get. The plates are generally quite small with portions, but quite pricey. To actually fill up on food, you drop big. For the 4 of us, it was over $250.

This is what all bike repair shops should be. I've been to the shop a few times to pick up tubes and other small accessories, and a few days I brought my beat-up, ridden-every-day-in-every-kind-of-weather trusty commuter in for a long overdue tune up. On every occasion they've had the accessory or part I've needed, and the guys behind the counter have been uniformly friendly, approachable, knowledgeable, and efficient. \u00a0Oh, and the prices? Fantastic. I was used to paying between $9 and $11 for a tube (yeah, I know) in DC. Here, tubes are a measly $6. Now, for the tune up. I brought my bike in two days ago with a substantial and unsettling wobble in the back wheel, frequent flats on the back tire, scraping brakes, messy, loud shifting, and a litany of other problems \u00a0that frankly, I hadn't thought about until they were no longer there. I braced myself, expecting to be told I needed a new wheel, or a $250 tune up (DC prices again...) that would take two weeks, so when they told me a tune up was $75 and I could have my baby back in TWO days, I was ecstatic. Sure enough, two days later I come back and find them just finishing up work on my bike. \u00a0Turns out I needed a new tire. They had two choices in stock - both reasonably priced and much nicer than what I had installed.I was thrilled, but not surprised, to learn that the bike techs are just as great as the people who've rung me up in the past. Absolutely not even a hint of snobbery or surliness from these lovely gentlemen. \u00a0While they were finishing up work, I asked them if it were possible to install a chain guard on my bike, should I ever get tired of wearing ripped up pants like a messy child. (Backstory - every other bike shop I've been to and a few internet forums have told me that since my bike as a front derailleur, I'm out of luck on this count.) The guys here said sure - they might have to order a part, but they could make something work. Wow. So to recap - I've got my bike back (riding like brand new) two days after I dropped it off. Total cost? $140 for a shockingly thorough tune-up, new tire, new brake pads, a few spare tubes, and an actual solution should I want to install a chain guard at some point. \u00a0Can't recommend these guys highly enough.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 1, 11]}, "29": {"description": "Anytime there is a problem with my bike this is the place I go!

The assortment of bikes here was awe-inspiring, and the colors, price-point and brands were (are) spectacular. I asked lots of questions, and received intelligent answers from the employees at the Roscoe Village bike shop. I was impressed with their knowledge/expertise. One of the issues that I was struggling with was finding the right bike for my height. I am only 5 ft 1 in, so finding a bike that fits my height was very, very challenging. I had a budget of what I wanted to spend (under $200 but over $130). I appreciated that they allowed me to 'test' ride the bike before making my final purchase. With Summer around the corner, I wanted to get back into riding a bike on a regular basis. I figured I run five or six days a week -- I am not a fitness fanatic, but I do like staying healthy. I thought why not continue to do so by riding a bike regularly. Instead of getting into my car, I am now planning to ride my bike around the city. I'm looking forward to using my car less during the summer months. However, I purchased my bike here, not because of all of these things, but it was their customer service that clinched it for me and made me \"close\" the deal.

The Famous Taco and Burrito is just what you would expect for a Mexican eatery located in a Strip mall. It's a total hole in the wall. This is a no frills Eatery that's all about the food. I left the Famous Taco, Burrito with my bag of delight and headed home to watch some football. My timing could not have been better. I got home just in time for the start of Fox NFL Sunday. I sat down with my bag of Mexican Goodies and watched Howie, Terry and Jimmy Johnson breakdown Sunday's Grid Iron battles. As I opened the bag the smells from my Steak Burrito and a Chorizo Taco filled my nose with delight. The Steak was beautifully marinated and delicious. My only complaint about the Burrito is that they put way too much sour cream in it. Other than that, it was top notch. The Chorizo taco was delicious. The greasy sausage was just what I needed to neutralize the Bourbon in my system from the night before. My impromptu Mexican lunch was awesome. Not even the sight of Jimmy Johnson's, Steroid hair could ruin it for me. The food even stayed in my stomach after the Bears played like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest against the Cardinals.

She took her time to be absolutely certain that everything was perfect on the wedding day. She also did a few of our bridesmaid's hair. Everyone was thrilled.

Holly and I had worked together before heading out to Mexico to come up with a few hairstyles that would work in the given climate on my big day. I was very indecisive about what I wanted and Holly was uber-patient with me while she tried various hairstyles. When the big day was upon us, we found that the weather was super hot AND super windy.

I had every confidence in Holly that she would do a great job, but again, I'm super picky and know that sometimes pleasing me is a never ending and thankless job! :) I soon found out that I had no reason to be nervous! I loved, loved, loved my hair on my wedding day and Holly's skills far exceeded my expectations! She wasted no time give me a wonderfully modern up-do as she knows I am not a big fan of up-do's. After she finished my hair and makeup, she worked fast and feverishly on the hair and makeup of my bridesmaids. We were being rushed out the door to get to the ceremony and Holly was still finishing her own hair and makeup that she chose to do last...which I thought was very selfless of her. The entire evening she would pop up with lip gloss and powder and bobby pins as everyone was snapping pictures all night long. After the cake cutting ceremony I was left with frosting all over my face and as soon as I turned around, Holly was there with makeup and napkins in hand!

Many deep dish pizzas tend to be soggy on the bottom and overly bready and heavy on the top. \u00a0Not at Bartoli's! \u00a0The bottom was thin and well cooked, and the top of the crust was like eating a piece of freshly baked thin bread. \u00a0With some deep dish pizzas I will leave the top crust behind; with Bartoli's, I inhaled it. \u00a0Second, the sauce. \u00a0It's not too thick yet not runny, just the right consistency. \u00a0It is a great combination of sweetness and spiciness, and goes really well with the crust. \u00a0Third of course is the cheese. \u00a0It's a really nice tasting cheese mixture that seems to pull everything together. \u00a0Just the right amount also; not oozing with cheese, but not leaving you feel like \"where is the cheese?\". \u00a0On our second visit we had a large deep dish with sausage and onion. \u00a0It was absolutely fabulous! \u00a0As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a BYOB. \u00a0They do have a bottle opener/corkscrew and some plastic cups available but if you want more fancy glassware, that should be BYO also. \u00a0They seem to do a very healthy carryout and delivery business, and the dining room is pleasant, but fairly small. \u00a0Both of our experiences were dining in the restaurant as the pizza came right out of the oven. \u00a0I have no knowledge of how well the pizza translates when picked up or delivered. \u00a0I know that they encourage people who order for pickup or delivery to get the pizza uncut to try and preserve the crispness of the bottom crust. \u00a0 The owner, Brian, stopped at our table and chatted for a while. \u00a0Really nice guy, and related to the founder of Gino's. \u00a0This pizza is not a Gino's knockoff, rather it is something that Brian has created through testing and experimentation. \u00a0I'm sure his pizza genealogy has helped him in creating a wonderful product. \u00a0 Give this place a try, it's worth a drive.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 26]}, "28": {"description": "I ordered (for delivery) a deep dish pizza with spinach and pepperoni, but the pizza that arrived was so soggy that I actually poured liquid out of the box before attempting to take a slice.

With little money and a dream, Man Jo Vins was born. It started as a hot dog stand where food was served through a window to loyal customers, winters as cold as ice and hot summers. The films of the grand opening of the Damen Ave. store and the little know Laramie store are in the family archives. All the uncles worked at MJV, including Uncle Frank Nuccio who recently passed away. He is loved and sorely missed. Lots of memories for me and my cousins at MJV. My first car was given to me in the parking lot (1961 Chevy, red and white). I am now 60 years old, but always stopped in when i was in Chicago. It made our families and that of the Porter, Nunzio Micelli, very comfortable financially. My Dad sold his share in 1968 shortly after my wedding, and moved to Florida. The only day it closed was for funerals of my Grandmother and Grandfather and my wedding with my name on the marquis announcing the big day. What a thrill!!!!

While I was getting tattooed, I looked around as much as I could and saw some of Caroline's previous work, as well as some of Gilly's, who also seems very talented. I felt immediately comfortable and not like I was taking a risk by walking into someplace sketchy and the prices are relatively low ($60 minimum, and my rather large and detailed tattoo was only $240).The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have nothing to compare it to.

I'm always a little anxious walking into places where people are way cooler than me (bike shop, coffee shop, tattoo parlor), but everyone working at Family Tattoo has a good attitude and doesn't give guff. The place is very clean, brightly lit, open, and comfortable.Caroline is exceptionally friendly, professional, and talented. After showing her some reference images during my consultation, she understood what I was looking for and got to work. The piece she showed me for my first actual sitting was perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. I am working on a pretty large piece, which has taken multiple sessions and will take a few more. Caroline is good about checking in with me if it seems like I'm zonking out, offers me stretch breaks when I forget that a stretch might be a good idea, and is a pleasure to joke around with.Caroline is easy to correspond with over email, and has accommodated a few reschedules for me, which I greatly appreciate.My half-sleeve is about 50% done. Each time Caroline works on a new section I'm excited to see what she's going to do, and I'm always happy with how the work turns out.In conclusion: Family Tattoo: welcoming, comfortable, and attitude-free.Caroline Moody: talented, professional, super-cool.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 7, 21]}, "49": {"description": "I was looking to add to my arm.

Unfortunately (for him), from the time I went and the time he was going to go, their female massage therapist was no longer working with them and my bf was not comfortable seeing their male massage therapist. Fortunately (for me) shortly after I purchased the gift certificate I was considering making a big change to my hair, but I was nervous about doing so.

One of the best things about Tony is that he is super fast...he colored, cut and did a blow out for me in about 90 minutes.

I called to come in and have it fixed and honestly, didn't think anything of it because I've had a standing relationship with her and I assume it's normal for clients to want minor changes/fixes. However, the reception I received from my stylist was cold at best and she blatantly was annoyed that I wasn't happy with my cut. The first thing she said to me was an abrasive \"So, what's up?\" - no hello, no how have you been, no apology that I wasn't happy with the cut. When I explained what I didn't like she told me that since I went with a little bit of a shorter length than I have in the past, she would have had to re-cut all of the layers. Um, ok, then isn't that what you should have done in the first place since I was requesting long layers? She literally spent five minutes, if that, quickly dry cutting chunks out of my hair and then was done. That's it. Then walked me out, told me to schedule my next appointment and that was it.

I did not have cash to tip, yes I know this isn't cool. It also isn't cool to be scolded for it though. They ran the tip on my credit card, painted my nails and rushed me out.

A year ago I bought two You Swoops for The Classic Nails Shop based on their few, but positive reviews.

I'm not sure what made me revisit their Yelp page, but I noticed an uptick in reviews and positive comments about new management; with great trepidation I decided to use my first certificate this past Fall and was pleasantly surprised. The salon isn't fancy or spa-like, but the equipment looks newer; there are approximately 6 manicure tables and 6 pedicure stations with the massage chairs. They also have a nice selection of mindless magazines to get me up-to-speed on important stuff like vases are out, bouquets are in*. Both visits, I was able to get in quickly, even when I used my second certificate a few days before expiration - just like a good little procrastinator should. I found both visits to be consistent and good, even the second time when they were dealing with an endless stream of stragglers. I don't really have any complaints about my manicure experience. Both times the technician who helped me was efficient and proficient. However, the pedicure left a bit to be desired. Both times it seemed like my feet soaked only briefly before they got down to business. I also wish there was more massaging, exfoliating and pumicing of my feet.

I don't like to use much product in my hair except maybe some mousse and hairspray, and I like a classic, yet edgy cut. He takes this all into consideration and provides his input when suggesting styles. He takes his time with me and makes sure that I am pleased with the results. I always leave satisfied with my hair cut! His prices are quite reasonable. You can leave tip on your credit card too, which is super convenient.Of course, Diadro is a really cool, sweet guy.Yeah, if you're not happy with your stylist or you're looking a talented stylist that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for a 'do, definitely book an appointment with Diadro. * - I started writing this review a few months ago.

The omelette was pretty good though. My boyfriend's steak tasted super weird, so all of us tried a piece, and we all agreed something was wrong. So, by that time there wasn't much of the steak left. We brought it to the waiter's attention and he was SUPER RUDE about it, telling us that it shouldn't taste weird and that maybe we shouldn't have eaten so much of it then.

I've won before and am always pleased each time I go back. The service is impeccable and they don't bother you too much either, which is a plus for me. Cucumber water is always filled and the food comes out rather fast which is nice as well. I can't think of any complaints. If I had to pick one... I would say... if you show up during peak hours, you might have to wait to sit down. Very popular, so I completely understand.

Both pancake dishes were topped with \"puddles of goodness\", as my dining partner noted- not too sweet concoctions of cream cheese whipped cream or something similar. But- it gets better!- the Rosemary Orange French Toast was magnificent. So, absolutely delicious. The brioche bread was sliced thick and perfectly battered. It wasn't soggy or mushy inside, but moist with a gorgeous, crisp crust outside. The rosemary orange cream and sliced almonds on top made this dish totally over the top!To polish off our meal we also had bacon, which was cooked just right, and a pretty little fruit plate.

Much more chic and cute than other local options... it is the type of place you'd go with a gal pal for a pedi date and to swap some gossip. With their very cute setup and nice, friendly techs, this salon is perfect for a girl who likes basic nail services. I can tell they do a beautiful job at spa pedis and classic square manis, but try to amp up the wow factor and you may find yourself disappointed. For starters, the selection of no-chip colors runs a bit light. I'm a bit of a no-chipaholic and can vouch their array is quite slim compared to most places that do no-chip. They didn't have a signature milky pink or a neon coral (my defaults) in their choices so I settled on a pastel blue and called it a day.The service started out alright until my tech completely abandoned me while my old no-chip mani was soaking off. She left me sitting to start on a gal who had just walked in (with no appt) despite the fact that I had made an appointment and was a bit pressed for time. I sat soaking for 30 minutes before I had to draw attention to the fact that I was a) slightly annoyed at this, b) running out of time and c) wanting to get the straight acetone off my nails. A different tech told me to sit tight and that someone else would be with me shortly. Another 10 minutes later and I was with tech #2 and #3 (they started double teaming at this point, which was nice and showed a sense of urgency). They got my no-chip off, slapped on the new blue color and then botched the shape of my nails. Womp, womp. One tech made them square while the other kept their existing almond shape as I had requested. They clearly struggle here with a more modern, trendy nail look. Glitter disco nails aside, I do wish they would have done better honoring my appointment over the walk in.

Nothing about these sandwiches stands out and makes them any different than one you could make at home.Do any of the people giving this place glowing reviews know what fresh bread, quality cold cuts and crisp vegetables taste like? Based on what Hero's is serving, I have no reason to believe they aren't just going down the street to Mariano's to buy their ingredients. I get it, they're a small place and they've been there since 19XX and they don't have a website or take credit cards and I guess that's all supposed to be part of the charm. Sure, fine, but I've been at total holes in the wall where they at least took debit cards and provided food that amounted to something they actually made and not something that could be assembled from the exact ingredients anyone can LITERALLY get at a grocery store.There are better sub options around Chicago, and I'm not just talking Jimmy John's, Subway, or Potbelly, although I'd still take any one of those chains over Hero's, which makes no attempt to set itself apart and do something unique or distinctive, much less fresh.

I would say the host was easily the funniest person to come on stage this night. And incase you are wondering, I went Tuesday, June 5th. From the the time the host was done with his act, things went down hill. My friends that had gone before even admitted that the acts were terrible compared to the first time they went (or for any stand up show). The first two acts were two guys who could not remember their own jokes and were completely all over the place in the train of thought it was not even funny. They maybe funny in normal conversations because of how awkward they are, but are not funny in stand up. The 3rd act was a female, who for the most part was semi-entertaining. The next two acts were females who were both anything but funny and who's acts were not at all stand up. One read some script that made no sense and the other seemed like she was trying to be Kristen Wig in an SNL skit, but was not funny. The final act was \"eh\". That is the ear way I can describe it.

This review is for their horrible customer service because I haven't actually been able to have a service there, but maybe if you can get and keep an appointment there, leave a review so everyone else can make an informed decision. I have used yelp for almost ten years, but have never really reviewed anything before because I have never been this motivated by an experience (good or bad) with a business. So here is my (long and frustrating) story:On 5/21/15, I purchased the yelp voucher that is currently being offered for $100 worth of services. I called their office that day (5/21/15) to make an appointment for a facial (specifically, a Hydrafacial, an amazing facial using special machine that isn't very common, which is why I chose this place and bought the yelp voucher) and they told me their esthetician would not be in the office for a few weeks, so I made my appointment for 6/10/15. I received a confirmation call on 6/9/15 for my appointment on 6/10/15, and then when I showed up to my appointment on 6/10/15, the person at the front desk asked my name, went to talk to someone, and then came back and told me the esthetician wasn't in the office (and she wouldn't be in for another few weeks because she had surgery, something they should have known the day before when they called me to confirm?) and that they called and left a message that morning telling me that my appointment was canceled. I did not receive any calls or messages from them that morning and I told them that, so I guess she was lied to by whoever told her that, or she lied to me. So normally I would not continue to try to give a place my business after getting such terrible customer service, but since I had that $100 yelp voucher, I needed to reschedule my appointment. Since the esthetician would again be out for another few weeks, I made an appointment for 7/10/15. Then on 6/29/15 I called to ask if the esthetician would be available on 7/2/15 instead, and was told she would be there that day so I made an appointment for 2:30pm. So I had a confirmed appointment for 7/2/15 at 2:30pm as of 6/29/15, 7/1/15 (when they called and left a message to confirm), and even today 7/2/15 (when I called at 11:35am to confirm my 2:30pm appointment, and then was asked to move it to 4pm because the esthetician wouldn't be there until then - another red flag). I even asked if the esthetician would actually be there at 4pm because she wasn't there last time I showed up for my appointment, and I was assured that the old esthetician was no longer working there and their new esthetician was very good. That being said, I moved my appointment to 4pm today (7/2/15), but because of all this shadiness, I called at 3:40pm today (7/2/15) to re-confirm that the esthetician would be there for the 4pm appointment. The women who answered the phone told me she would check and then I was put on hold for 5 minutes without anyone coming back to the phone. Then I tried calling back and was sent to voicemail twice so I left a message telling them that I would not be there for my 4pm appointment unless I heard back from them. I did not hear back from them until 4:15pm and she gave me the excuse that the esthetician had surgery and they thought she would be in the office, but she's not (even though earlier today I was assured that there was a new esthetician and the other one was no longer there - another lie I guess?) and they wanted me to reschedule. I told them that this was not acceptable, that I've been given the run-around for over a month and that I wanted to cancel my appointment, not reschedule, and that I would be leaving them bad reviews and getting my money back for my yelp voucher (which hopefully yelp comes through and gives me a refund).

I'm sure that she dreaded doing my waist length hair, but she looked happy doing her job, and that made me less nervous about my new transformation. I love this place. Good vibe, good artists, and good souls. They are very reasonable with their prices as well.

Once I got in the chair, we spent some time discussing different directions we could take my hair in and finally I just told her to do whatever she thought would look best...and I'm glad I did.After a relaxing wash (I heart head massage), she gave me a totally new look and everyone, including me, loves it. She obeyed my few rules: must be low maintenance; must be able to go a while without being cut (that is, look good once it starts to grow out so my cheap ass doesn't have to pay for another haircut until I absolutely have to); and must be fun/different. \u00a0Her chair-side manner was top notch - very friendly/chill. We spent half the time talking and the other half silent, which is to say, she goes off your lead, which is nice, b/c sometimes I just like to shut up and enjoy my haircut.

It's like I don't care who gives me my yearly exam...but I won't go to just ANYONE for a trim....I have tried so many different places (from Mario Tricoci to Buzz to everything in between) but always end up flying back to Michigan to go to my stylist there (and, uh, see my family....)But my search is over. And Tiffany is my girrrrl. Tiffany is GREAT. I walked in to the salon with a grainy picture on my iPhone that was taken after my most recent Michigan haircut. Tiffany played with my hair a little, asked me a few questions, and got to work. And I don't know HOW she did it, but she gave me exactly what I wanted (which I know for a fact I wasn't very good at explaining). She listened to me, she only cut an inch when she said she'd only cut an inch, and she gave me the cutest bangs I've had in a long time.And can we just talk about the blow out? AMAZING. So amazing, in fact, that a stranger stopped me on my bus ride back to Lakeview to ask me where I got my hair done and what their phone number is.The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there is no receptionist and everyone books their own appointments. So...it can get a little tricky to get a hold of the person you want. BUT, once you go, you'll have Tiffany's personal cell phone number, so booking in the future is a breeze.If you're looking for some ritzy salon, Hair Party is not for you.

Rob and his assistant were so nice, they answered my questions and since I had come in with a few ideas, Rob talked with me and gave me his input. The day before my appointment he even called me to discuss the design again in a constructive way (he was not being pushy or trying to get me to change my mind at all, so no one get the wrong idea!!) and I really appreciated his feedback.The end result was breathtaking and every part of the process incredible. The after care instructions I got also seemed to speed the healing process. I fully endorse the anti-microbial soap and tattoo lotion they sell there.

I'd pay that at Hooters or BWW because the quality is there, but for Wingstop? Naw, that's about $2 too high.Speed- From the order time to receiving my wings, it took probably 10 minutes.

Wings were of adequate size, but I've had bigger (that's what she said!). Parmesan Garlic was NOTHING like what I expected (something more akin to BWW Parmesan Garlic). WS's version was deep fried wings that were lightly coated in a \"garlic\" butter and sprinkled with grated parm... I mean, yeah, it was techinically \"Parmesan Garlic\" but maybe they should rethink the receipe. As for \"Hot,\" I must've gotten mild by mistake, because there was barely any heat whatsoever.

So, I've liked WS in the past, that's why I keep ordering from here. My husband likes boneless wings, so that's what I've always ordered from them. They are great, love the sauces, love their fries, pretty decent and consistent customer service in all the WS. I like that they have an app and I can order the food with my phone then pick it up in aprox. an hour. So, tonight was Super Bowl. I really could have cared less. I needed food on my way home from work. When I tried to order on the app, they weren't accepting any further online orders due to Super Bowl. Alright, so I called them, anticipating the worst.

The food was hot and ready when I got there, the staff was competent, and all that was appreciated.So, my husband and I are doing this whole low carb thing, so I decide to order the regular wings to cut down on the amount of breading, with a large side of coleslaw. So, now, the reason is coming that I am giving them 3-stars instead of 5. The wings were really terrible! The wings were super skinny with like barely 2 bites of meat on each little wing-ding. I've actually NEVER seen wings that small and skinny, and then frying them just shrunk them down even more and dried out a lot of the meat, making each wing mostly bone. So, I might have given it 4-stars and just said, order the boneless wings, but come on! The place is called WING STOP for goodness sake. A boneless wing is nothing more than a chicken nugget made from the breast, not even a wing. If your name says wings, your wings should be rockin'.

He didn't even offer to 'note in my account' that my next order I shouldn't pay for the fries. Since I didn't get them and PAID for them. I ordered today and went to pick up.

No. There's a few reasons why I would not.I got a gift certificate for Christmas and went with a friend on the Dec. 30th. She was going to leave me but I convinced her to stay with and enjoy a relaxing night of pampering. Now this is just to paint a picture for you... They tell me to pick a color, so I walk over to the wall with all the polish. I attempted to pick a color, but let's be honest here picking a color is one of the hardest decisions a woman ever has to make. After about ten minutes I could not decide (reason #1 not a very big color selection). My friend was getting a no chip and usually when I cant decide any nail shop i go to i can look at the gel colors,decide from there and then ask the tech for a similar color in regular polish. Then ask the tech if they have anything similar in a regular polish. My friend is done picking out her color so I grab the basket and start looking. One of the nail techs come from the front of the shop and specifically say(with an attitude i might add) \"are \u00a0you done looking at the colors?\". Now she had already been giving me side eye since i walked through the door and i told her jokingly \"No i'm not\". So she says \"Well i need it!\" Now the inner ratchetness almost emerged out of me but instead of causing a scene i rolled my eyes, said \"well excuse me,here.\" and handed her the basket(reason #2). The pedicure was great and looked good. Now I asked for a full set of acrylic nails. One thing for sure is they are persistent with trying to up-sell you which can get pretty annoying. Now I also did notice they are not very sanitary.(reason #3) I've been to many nail salons who are much cleaner then them. Before she started I asked her \"Can you clean up my cuticles like a manicure?\" she completely ignored me, but kept asking if i wanted to upgrade to gel polish.(reason #4) Once She was done and i was able to inspect my nails. I asked for coffin. They were uneven and wide. The surface was lumpy. (reason #5)Then an hour after getting them done my middle finger nail breaks. Oh, i was livid! (reason #6)I go back in on the 31st which was a bad idea because they were packed. I wait for the tech to finish with her client to fix my nail and instead of taking the rest of the nail off and redoing it she uses the electric filer to file it down where it broke and just add the tip and acrylic. (reason#7)Now at this point because the same chick that gave me the attitude with the basket is still looking at me up and down sizing me up. I'm too the point where I just want to get the hell out! She then finishes the nail and tells me \"don't mess it up. I'm too busy ok?!\"(reason#8)Once I am waiting at the dryer for the nail to dry. I notice there is a clear line on the acrylic that indicates where she filed down and you can see where she was lazy and just added the nail tip. Then the polish was lumpy. The owner then came over and put the clear coat on it and made it a little better.(reason#9)Now I have gotten my nails done so many times where they last a long time or long enough for me to be able to get a fill in. Not even a week after that same middle finger nail broke off and at that point I am pissed off and just take all of them off.(reason #10)So NO! I will never come here again.

Either check out the daily lunch sandwich specials above the water jug (available until 5pm) or ask for a full menu. At all hours I've found the cashier to be willing to make recommendations. Grab one of the few stools inside and the cashier will bring your dinner to you. If you don't order a drink they have plastic cups and a water jug for you to help yourself.It can get really crowded during colder months since there are so few seats in this corner lot space. They offer delivery and carryout if you'd prefer to eat at home. Heck, you could even sit in your car in their lot if you didn't want to wait. I wouldn't judge.Before you go: I recommend the masitas de puerco appetizer. It's magically crispy on the outside and super tender and juicy inside.

She really knows a lot of great restaurants in the city! We've been here several times over the years. My favorite dish is the Churrasco which is marinated skirt steak and super tender. It is served with garlic sauce, a little parsley, yellow rice and boiled yuca (which is like a potato) con mojo de ajo. If you do not like garlic do not order this dish. My husband always orders the Fricase de pollo which is perfectly prepared with an goluptious of flavors and fall off the bone tender. The vibe is cool with people of all ages. When we came here, I heard the song, \"Come on, Shake Your Body Baby, Do the Conga!\" I started tapping my foot to the beat of the music. Hey, after a few drinks I really wanted to start a Conga line, but I was afraid I'd get kicked out of the restaurant. Maybe next time I'll get the courage to actually start a Conga line! Oh, but I digress....back to the food....For starters, we ordered the empanadas (three different kinds) -- chicken, ropa vieja and beef. They don't tell you which one is which so you have to bite into them to find out \"which\" one is chicken, beef or ropa vieja. We shared the stuffed papa which was perfectly prepared and very, very good. Empanadas are worthy of 4 stars. The stuffed potatoes are 5 stars worthy. To be perfectly honest, I have had much better Cuban comida (food) at other Cuban restaurants in Chicago (for a lot less). Give \"El Cubanito\" in Logan Square a shot (OMFG, I love their steak and Cuban sandwiches). Also, hit up \"Paladar\" (Western Ave) or even \"Se\u00f1or Pan (on North Ave, near Western) for tasty Cuban comida. Se\u00f1or Pan has two locations, but I prefer their North Ave joint. La comida at these places is actually much more delectable with higher quality cuts of meat than here. You're welcome for these tips! We usually bring two bottles of wine. We enjoy Argentinian wines, such as, Malbec or Tempranillo, both pair nicely with meat dishes. Go here early (even if you don't usually eat an early dinner), especially on weekends. We brought along two bottles of Bodegas Graffigna 2012 Centenario Malbec, but any Malbec wine balances nicely with meat dishes. Service is effusive, but incredibly lackadaisical. On weekends, it gets super crazy crowded for dinner. I recommend trying this joint for lunch instead. The wait can be crazy long for dinner service, especially on weekends. It is a small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. It can also get very polyphloisboisterous inside! You may wait up to 30-minutes for your comida, so definitely pop open your bottle of vino and order several appetizers to avoid passing out at your table. The food is flavorful with various Latin herbs and spices. Portions are fine, but not huge. This is a great place for people of all ages (great for small groups, not large). The outdoor seating fills up quickly in the Summer. Hey, if you do not mind inhaling gas fumes while enjoying your meal then sit outside, by all means! \u00a0Parking around here can be a pain in the ass. The inside is really dated. Nothing spectacular. The decor is rather tired, dark, dingy and boring. Service -- 3 stars (at a turtle's pace)Price-point -- 4 starsCuisine -- 4 starsAmbiance/Decor -- 3 starsOutdoor patio -- 2 stars (please invest in new tables/chairs)For the best Cuban sandwiches hit up \"El Cubanito\" or \"Paladar\" (definitely get the Ropa Vieja here). Also, Cohiba Cuban Cuisine (Broadway, east side, half block north of Diversey) serves outstanding ropa vieja. El Paladar and Cohiba are great spots for a date night with your spouse or for a \"First\" date. Also, give Se\u00f1or Pan a shot -- really good spot for lunch or dinner (North Ave location). If you are seeking exceptional and delectable Puerto Rican cuisine, hit up Casa Yari, Juanita's or La Plena.

There seemed to be confusion as to where food was going, which sort of dragged things out a while. I imagine it might help if the staff asked their customers if they would be seated indoors or on the patio....I waited for 20+ minutes for two coffees and my shake. This was definitely more than I would like to wait, and I consider myself extremely patient.

First, I wandered past the place two or three times, since there's not really a sign or anything to tell you where it is. I finally took a look through the window on the door, and could barely make out the figure of people inside, since (at least in my imagination, I'll have to go back and make sure) the window was too grimy to properly see through. Finally walk in, and the place smells like the cool kid you knew in high school's basement. There is a jukebox the runs LASER DISKS, which I haven't seen in like a decade. There is absolutely insane art on the walls, a lot of which features anthropomorphic brains. I sit down at the bar, and get a pint of 5$ Great Lakes (and they had equally good beers for cheaper I think!). The bartender was a really friendly guy, and fills the glasses up absolutely to the rim and overflowing (none of that bullsh*t where they give you a half full glass and charge full price!). There were like 10 other people in the bar at the time, and it was the perfect volume for having a conversation. Then the guy comes over. This dude just sits down next to me and kind of awkwardly strikes up a conversation. I quickly gather he's heavily intoxicated, but is generally really friendly (although does say a few offensive things that would have made me think twice about him if he wasn't otherwise a merry guy). He proceeds to tell his life story (including his time in prison, coming to Chicago and starting a consulting gig, in true \"Fear and Loathing\" style his crazy night with his attorney that night, and how he met his girilfriend). He also apparently knows everyone else in the bar, and (once again mildly offensively) calls one over who seems to be a bit less amused with his condition. He buys everyone shots, throws up a bit, and zips back and forth for the rest of the evening. If anyone has seen the Miyazaki movie \"Spirited Away\" and remembers how that guy was the \"River Spirit\", this guy right here was the \"Dive Bar Spirit\". He truely made my evening from kinda meh to absolutely incredible. Anyway, that is the kind of place the Hungry Brain is, and I can't wait to go back.

I'm so happy to have a place like Yelp to forewarn hungry consumers what you're in for. This place is a dreadful disappointment, I wish I could say they just must have been having a bad day, but its my second attempt at eating here, took me about 8 months to give it another try after the first disappointment. So now I'm confused by the glowing reports from other people. In honesty I'm familiar with Vietnamese food so granted I'm no novice (stepmom was French Vietnamese). Okay. So..When I stepped in at lunchtime the place was empty, and the server was grumpy looking, stupidly I thought I'll be the cheerful one and make friendly conversation and engage her, perhaps help her improve her mood. Time wasted. Yeah I shouldn't have to do that, I know. I ordered the shrimp spring roll and a soup, by the time I was long gone from the place I discovered they had given me tofu spring roll and no spoon for the soup. The place was empty, what excuse can you have? The roll was small, flimsy, and really tasteless, the tofu was hard and dry on the edges. (Nothing like that picture you see on Yelp) All bad. Three days ago I made spring rolls for the first time ever and they were knockout, on my first attempt! I poured the soup down the drain, wasn't worth eating. This is their business, I don't understand I really shouldn't be able to do better than what they make. So for an $9 lunch,(silly me gave a tip to cheer her up) I came out hungrier than when I went in. My analogy it was like eating air, nothin' there.When I called to complain the response was as limp as my spring roll. \u00a0Quote 'We hope you come back' to what another disappointment?

She started with my eyebrows and told me that she likes to work quickly. I was definitely okay with that because who wants a wax to last long? Anyway, even though I told her I liked the natural looking, fuller brow, she waxed below AND above the brow line and totally thinned my brows into lines. I was angry since my brother's wedding was that weekend, but figured I could pencil them in. The bikini was was very painful, of course but seemed mostly okay. That is until two days later when I realized the hair hadn't been pulled out, but ripped off at the surface so that it was already growing back in weird patches. Gross, I know. I called to complain and left a message about my problem. (Again, weird hours, so I could hardly ever get anyone.) They didn't even bother calling me back! I tried one other time and still was ignored. Their regular prices are ridiculous for how cheap the experience and quality is, so I will NEVER be going here again.

I will start and \u00a0finish this post \u00a0with DO NOT GO TO MARiA \u00a0! After 3 years of using Maria for body sugar waxing , always tipping her well , always being nice to her , this is what she did to a regular client who used her for pretty expensive services ! First , the salon is very modest, but that wouldn't be a problem if it didn't seem dirty at all times, I blame Maria she is the female in the salon , whatever you do ,don't go to the bathroom , instead of relaxing or neutral music they listen to Judge Judy and similar type Tv program , if you are not Spanish speaking person , Maria often works on you while she talks to the owner in Spanish , they laugh and it might be about you , but you would never know ! So I think they try only to make their Spanish speaking customers happy ! Back to how Maria treated her longtime client , she is usually late like 15-20 minutes if you come when she begins her shift , which I have gotten used to , I think she lives close by and the owner calls her when her first customer comes in. For me it was every time as I always scheduled the mid day hours , she wouldn't step in the salon before noon to safe her life , as I have asked her \u00a0to come earlier few times ! I really don't think she even wants the job , definitely does not take it serious after I came at 1.15 pm as agreed , nobody says anything , the owner cuts somebody's hair, Maria's room is closed with the little divider , she does not come out to apologize, ask me if I am ok waiting , would I like to reschedule , I can only hear her talk and giggle with customer inside, 50 minutes later , she comes out without apologizing , walks me in the room where she works, I was really upset , I told her why didn't she let me know she would be late , we got into pretty mild exchange \u00a0, no voices were raised , as she worked we both didn't say a word, I thought she wouldn't charge after being almost hour late, she did, so I didn't leave tip at all , as I was leaving she didn't say even goodbye ! I am kind of a person who is forgiving and pretty much always avoid confronting if possible , so as I was ready for new appointment I called her , told her I realize it was awkward for the both of us but we have known each other for long time, so I asked her if she has availability, she booked me, only few days later to cancel the appointment in a text less the 24 hours to the scheduled time ( she has done it before) but I should have gotten the hint unfortunately I didn't realize , as she made it sound it was emergency , I texted few days later and she explained in a text that she does not want to give me her services ! I would have never written this post if she said that in that first phone call after the incident what she said in the text ! The only question is if I didn't like her being late, her dirty work room, her Spanish speaking while working on me, why didn't I leave earlier , the answer is because she uses Alexandria sugar wax that I used to use in Europe, my skin does not react good to regular wax ! When I came to Chicago four years ago she was the only one to my knowledge to use Alexandria, good news is that there are few more salons now that use the same product ! As I was using her I never did additional research until her disrespectful behavior , so if you want late , dirty floor, dirty bathroom, questionable towels, cell phone ringing while she works on you while you hear Judge Judy in the back , use Maria ! I have to say one thing the owner seems like cool dude, he does hair \u00a0and I feel bad writing this about his salon as he shares the space with her ! Maria you are such a disappointment!!!!!!!! Nobody is gonna be ok if you are late 50 minutes and you don't even make big deal to apologize and charge for your service, I was good enough to call back as I thought you were nice person but you are spoiled person who takes the job from somebody who would really appreciate it !", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 11, 25]}, "9": {"description": "Do you know what it's like to walk around with NO left eyebrow?

The dish came with a cornbread hashbrown side, which was decent, but at the entire plate costing just under $10, definitely was not worth it. The person I was with had green eggs & ham with hashbrowns. It appeared to be an egg scramble with bits of ham in it. He said it was ok. His totaled a tad over $10.I think the important thing here is to note that the place might be good for ovo-lacto vegetarians who consume eggs & dairy, but they shouldn't really boast a large vegetarian brunch menu because plenty of us don't eat eggs.

A presumed homeless woman told me, \"white boy shouldn't be here less you lookin' fo' crack.\" I've since referred to the Clybourn Market as \"Crackhead Corner.\" The area has changed a lot since then. Big brick yuppie condos and an increased police presence has made this area slightly safer. Very little has changed at Crackhead Corner though, and it's awesome. A fine selection of 40, 32 and 24 oz. beer/malt liquor beverages that are priced \"out-the-door\" (tax included).

Those are resolutions I actually look forward to keeping! So this year, I challenged myself to learn to make a new cocktail every week, and with that, I'm also trying to use the proper glassware. I've been searching around for a classic coupe glass ( which also doubles as an old-school champagne glass) that wasn't inappropriately large, but the only ones I found were either way too big or were over $10 apiece. I didn't need anything fancy, just one to serve its purpose. Apparently this is a difficult thing to find. Why does anyone need a cocktail glass that holds 7 oz. of liquor? Three sips in and your drink is too warm. Ah, yes, it's the old \"bigger is better\" mentality.My hunt led me to Krasny. I'd always been curious about this place but due to its prohibitively inconvenient hours (M-F, 9-5), I could never make it in. I was taking the day off yesterday anyway, so I was finally able to put my curiosity to rest and check it out.Victory was mine! They carried three different sizes of coupe glasses (not to mention any other type of glass you could ever want) as well as other cooking tools, gadgets and assorted restaurant wares. As I feared, I could only purchase the glasses in multiples of a dozen. But at less than $40, I went for it. They're nothing fancy (just regular old Libbey brand), but they're exactly what I needed to start making all those fancy drinks. \u00a0And naturally while I was there, I stocked up on other kitchen tools and doodads. This stuff is utilitarian. They're not carrying plates that Alinea serves food on; \u00a0It's restaurant- grade, and meant for heavy use. The place itself is bare bones, wonderfully dingy, and retro in that old mom-and-pop-store kind of way. The owner is super helpful and knows everything about what he sells.What a great source.

Lots of one way streets, permit parking only locations (watch out for these, you'll get a ticket, and Chicago is serious about their parking tickets), and plenty of cars already on street can make it difficult to find a home for your vehicle.

You load right in to the venue and easily get your gear on stage for sound check. Sound guys (where are the sound girls? Never a sound girl) have always been good here. Backline your gear or it gets stored in the wings of the stage. The stage is not big, but big enough for 3 bands, easily. Share gear if you can.The green room is upstairs, door is near the main entrance next to the bar. It's a really nice space upstairs, stocked with tubs of beer and plenty of space to hang out.

We tried to stop the waitress (who seemed to be the only one having to tend to the entire event space) to ask about more seating, but she just flew by us barely looking at us long enough to say, \"I'll be back\".

They have maybe three ceiling fans in the event space, which - you guessed it - are above all the people who got lucky enough to have seats.

Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect, but she made things right and perfect. She had her delivery guys take the piece back and had a much better product delivered a few days later. It looks stunning, just what i had envisioned in my head, I don't mind at all that it wasn't perfect the first time around. What I like is their business approach that if something isn't quite right or perfect, she will make it perfect.I only do wish they didn't rush it the second time as it did have a little bit of a paint smell that I'm not fond of but it may not bother most people as I'm just very sensitive to smells. What's also nice is that if you share whatever piece you order with Meg, she will send you a gift card for $25 to use as a thank you for giving her business.I do plan on working with Meg in the future as I like that she acknowledges when she makes a mistake and makes things right.

Love the atmosphere, owners, and the pricing (12 for a mani?!). By far the happiest, friendliest, and most engaging nail technicians I have ever interacted with. My daughters and I got manicures, including an absolutely pristine French, and an incredible lip wax that was so well done it didn't redden.

I was always a walk in. Parking is metered on the street but just outside the door and typically not to hard to find, or you could drive around the neighborhood for a free spot. Leaving out one star (and also the reason I don't really go anymore) because they only do 'natural' nail services (no acrylics) which is fine, just not totally full-service like some other nail salons in the area. Highly recommended if you're in the market for a wonderful no-chip or relaxing pedi!", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 10, 13]}, "30": {"description": "Thanks to the Nail Loft! \u00a0I had been eagerly anticipating this opening as I've passed by a few times during their renovation and it looked so cute. \u00a0And cute it is - really clean and a total turn around from what was in the space before. \u00a0It's very bright and cheery with chandeliers and other cute touches. \u00a0The staff was super nice. \u00a0I was running by and totally sweaty and popped my head in to see if they were indeed open. \u00a0They were! \u00a0So, I let them know that I would be back in the afternoon to get a manicure. \u00a0They were so accommodating - even though I was sweaty and had no money or wallet on me, they told me to come on in and that I could come back later and pay. \u00a0WHAT?! Wow! \u00a0I said no, but didn't need much prodding. \u00a0So, I had a very relaxing manicure. \u00a0I sat for a bit afterwards to dry them, but then went home to grab some money so that I could go back and pay! \u00a0They seemed a smidge surprised that I returned (either so fast or at all!), but I did return. \u00a0Really great deal - $11 manicure if you pay with cash ($12 otherwise). \u00a0No neck/back massage (which I love typically), but really relaxing and friendly. \u00a0Clean and neat and a great spot!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 10, 3]}, "3": {"description": "What a great experience!
