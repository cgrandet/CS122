(the time estimate was a little under an hour) I called and they corrected it pretty easily and the driver came about 3 minutes after I called them. So the food was twenty minutes later than expected but the wrong apt number may have to do with that. The flautas were good, the beans and rice, even better!

It's not because it's such a great place, but due to a lack of options. Here's a bullet pointed run down:The service: I've never really had a problem with their service, although I've given up on them trying to get my last name right (fair enough, it's not a common last name, but it's Spanish!) . Their attitude ranges from polite to indifferent. I just figure if they're curt with me, it's because they're extremely busy. They're usually more polite when I order in Spanish.The menu: Huge. You can order pretty much anything. And it's actually a pretty good value. The food: I'd say it's fairly good. I generally order it for delivery, and while it has always come in a timely manner, it will have cooled down significantly by the time it gets to my house. I've gotten used to nuking it for thirty seconds after it comes to the door. I imagine if it was delivered hot it would be a lot better. Personally, I'd rather wait an extra twenty minutes to ensure that it comes to my door hot rather than have to throw it in the microwave.The verdict: If this place didn't deliver until silly o'clock in the morning, I probably wouldn't bother with them. If you live in their delivery area, and you're feeling hungry and lazy -especially if it's late at night- then go ahead and give them a call.

If you read through the reviews of this place, you know that there's some serious hype about this sandwich. It's delicious - maybe not 5 stars delicious, but still amazing. However, it's such a unique dish that I haven't seen at a standard Mexican place, so I highly recommend it just so you can experience it! It's simultaneously soft and crunchy. The bread has a bit of crunch on the outside - the guajillo chili pepper rub is a nice addition. The bread is unbelievably soft and perfect. The carne asada was probably the thing I enjoyed more. To be honest, I wasn't ENTIRELY sure what a gordita was, so I googled it. What did I get? stupid pictures of taco bell's gordita - not very helpful. The gordita is kinda of like hybrid quesadilla and taco (refer to my pictures). It was delicious, and freshly homemade (like legit, since I got there right as they were opening, the mom told me it would be a bit longer because she was just in the process of making the gordita).Do note that this place is cash only, but it's pretty cheap!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 22]}, "3": {"description": "I'll keep this simple.The food is phenomenal, Lorena was an excellent Host/Server, and the music was elegant and complimentary to the dining experience. \u00a0If your looking for quintessential and authentic Mexican cuisine, look no further than El Habanero in Logan Square.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 2, 21]}, "35": {"description": "Sweet mom and pop restaurant that makes delicious food.

Still delicious, cheap, and with excellent service.I ate in this time, and ordered the pambazos the classic way -- with papas y chorizo. Unbelievable, truly. Seasoning on the chorizo was perfect, the potatos had a great balance of crispiness/softness, and the bread. Oh man, the way they prepare the bread gives the outside a thin, crispy, skin-like texture, and the inside is toasty, moist, and buttery. Lettuce was fresh and light, adding a nice crunch, and the crema helped tie all the textures in together.Also had a chance to try the chips and the pico de gallo. The chips were satisfyingly crunchy and weren't too brittle -- perfect for dipping. The pico was (interestingly) sort of blended, but I could taste the jalapenos which provided a very nice kick. It was also refreshingly NOT too sweet! Nothing bothers me more than when a Mexican place puts too much sugar in their Pico -- PICO AIN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE SUGAR. Habanero nailed the balance.

I had their shrimp and fish tacos (among other things) and wanted 10 more, except that the line was really long and we didn't have time to wait. Generally Mexican food is hard to screw up since it is so tasty, but this restaurant took the tastes to a new level. I have been back several times since, leaving each time with great impressions. Even the guac and chips here were great. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy, while the guac contained chunks of fresh avocado with some craisins (which some are not a fan of, but I certainly welcome them). The atmosphere is very casual, with music blasting in the background, no table service, and nothing fancy about the decor. The prices reflect this low-key ambiance (but not the quality of the food) - under $6 for a wholesome burrito. The tacos were just over $2 each but are quite small. A few more logistical notes: since orders are taken fast-food style, even a very long line may only indicate a 15-minute wait. However, once you order the wait can be a bit lengthy, especially at peak times (20-30 minutes). Thus I recommend getting a side order (like chips) first while waiting, since they are prepared much more quickly.

But it was super busy with a decent wait to get seated so because we were on the go we decided to try another mexican restaurant. L'patron popped up in yelp app so we decided to go there. When we arrived there was a long line to order but the line moved fast. The seating area was all packed. My boyfriend and I both ordered two steak burritos both suizo on top and cheese extra inside. With a horchata. The horchata was pretty cheap and it tasted amazing. Luckily while we were waiting for our to go order, some window seats opened up. It took awhile to get our food. Once we opened up our to go boxes we were super disappointed because we paid extra for both to have cheese on top and neither of them did.

Steak- tacos or tortas always overcooked and charred like it was made on that one neighbors grill who never cleans the grates and is always flaring up. The Horchata was meh. The salsa was ok but it tastes like it was made w/ketchup like at El CID, but not as good. I did like the atmosphere,and thought it funny how they play salsa, and country music at a Mexican Restaurant. The highlight of each visit was the guacamole.

They wrap them in paper with twisty ends that helps to hold it together but it's a battle you're destined to lose to sticky fingers. The Carne Asada Steak & Pollo Adobo Marinated Chicken are very close 2nd favorites to the pork. Which one wins would clearly be a matter of personal preference. The fish taco was a little too tartary for my taste but that's literally my only minor critique. Their guacamole is made with dried cherries & who knew that would make it so delicious - but it does. They are generous with homemade chips and their red & green salsas are available at your table. Green is way spicier!You order at the counter, cash only.

I thought that was very fair so I bought both. My daughter chose the one she wanted immediately not opening the 2nd one. I intended to return the other one but forgot about it.

I immediately took it back thinking I would exchange it for many other items as she needed everything and being a first time Grandma, I wanted to buy out the store. When I walked in, there were two woman sitting behind the desk on the phone. I placed the belt on the counter to get their attention and so they didn't think I stole it. I then walked around gathering items and patiently waiting for someone to acknowledge me. When one of them finally hung up, (never gave me the just a minute sign), she looked at the receipt and practically threw the belt back at me stating, \"This was bought 6 weeks ago!!! I can't take this back!!!\" With a tone in her voice that was more of an accusation. I said I did not expect my money back. I knew I exceeded the 14 days so a store credit would be fine. I had about $200 worth of items I was prepared to buy. She held the belt out and said I could not have a store credit as that was only good for 30 days which I also exceeded. Funny, no one ever mentioned the stuck forever after 30 days part or I would never have bought it. I literally begged her to apply the credit to the many items I was about to purchase. I reasoned that the maternity belt was a staple item that they carry all the time with no expiration date and will never go out of style. It was also untouched, unopened. Needless to say, I dropped the merchandise and walked out. I almost never went back but coming across the belt again, I tried one more time a few months later thinking reason and good business sense may help. Same story different month.

My roommate ordered a Thai tea along with a beef kimchi soup noodle while I ordered a taro slush with an order of Thai green curry shrimp fried rice.

Thai tea was cloyingly sweet but that's Thai tea for you. Taro slush was a little icy and not as smooth as I would have liked. First came the Korean beef noodle soup and all I can say is YUM! Nice broth with huge kimchi flavor. Only thing I would have changed was the noodles. Didn't really care for those too much. Great dish anyways. My fried rice took a little longer and wasn't as tasty as I expected. I was hoping for that strong coconut creamy taste that you get from Thai curry but this didn't have it at all.

I am tempted to tell people I made the sisig myself, but I'd rather get the word out and let everyone know that one of the best sisig in America is here in Chicago. The one bad thing about the sisig though is that you can only purchase it in a big party tray and you have to call in advance to place an order. Although they sometimes sell half orders of the party tray if you request for it. And a very important thing to remember, they sell their sisig cold. So heat before serving! Definitely the place to go to for awesome home cooked Filipino food. They also have some Asian grocery items but are very limited.I would give them 5 stars for the quality of their food but I just have to take away 1 star because of their not so friendly customer service when taking orders over the phone. All the times I have called in an order, the person on the other line is always curt with her responses almost to a point of sounding rude.

Narragansett AveChicago, Illinois 60639Dear Shop OwnersOn December 3, 2015, I had my eyebrows, eyelashes, manicure and pedicure done at your facility where I received poor services by your owners/employees. While \u00a0getting my pedicure service I received a rushed job for what was suppose to be the top of the line pedicure which included sugar scrub and heated rock massage. The gentleman cut my cuticle using a \u00a0motorized file: now it is causing me discomfort. I also had your services for eyelashes which I complained while I was there. \u00a0I was \u00a0serviced by an inexperienced technician who burned my eyes by repeatedly by letting the glue and acetone (her words) drop into my eyes and on my face. She also had me holding her supine string me she is lazy but she was taking her time so they would last. However her asking for my assistance caused my left thumb nail, right pointer finger and my right big toe(she stepped on my toe) to become damaged. When I informed her she said not worry it will be repaired. \u00a0When she was done she told me she as only going to charge me $60 don't tel them she took off money for me and for me to come next week she would fix the lashes she took my credit charged me $60 I signed and thought all monies owed was compensated for. Afterwards I was asked if she could take a photo of her work; I agree. She the returns and tells me they said I have to pay an addition $10. Then I was asked to sit to have the nails repaired a woman I assume to be the owner or owners wife sat down to assist me. I thought she would have easily removed the nail polish and re-polished the nails. She chose to dip her finger in acetone and smooth the damaged \u00a0polish(which left bumps and ridges) then proceeds to clump more polish on top of the nail. Told me to sit under the dryer. She never came back to apply a top clear coat. This same woman comes over to the drying station and rudely interrupts a conversation between myself and another patron to tell me I'm dry I can leave. The woman I was holding the conversation with was even taken aback and stated why was she trying to rush me out of the shop? \u00a0After being in the facility for more than 3hrs (waiting for the excessive polished nails to dry. I began to try to gather my belongings, my shoes were no where near me as usually they are. So I had to wait as they located them. As I was leaving I was asked for additional money by the rude and lazy technician who I am assuming is the owner or owners wife. I informed I was not going to give anymore money. She asked why with a very nasty tone and I replied firmly yet politely due to poor customer service and that I was trying not to make a scene. In which she pursued. So I told her your technician did a halfway job on my pedicure and manicure (he didn't even get all the nail polish off nor did he use cuticle remover, he only used water. The eyebrow and lashed lady almost blinded me by dropping chemicals in my face and eyes and asked for help doing her job. To top it off the nail repair she did was shoddy. A few derogatory words were exchanged where she told me not to come back and I responded I hadn't planned on it. \u00a0 I went home and my eyes, eye lids and eyelashes were still irritated. Later that night I woke up to my eye swollen shut. \u00a0I had to go to Urgent Care the following \u00a0day to receive medical attention. Where I was informed I had a chemical burn and was infected. \u00a0 I have been prescribed antibiotics I am in severe pain and anguish. \u00a0\rPlease do not patronize the establishment.

Some of the reviews here gripe about the slow service of the place, but when the food is this good... you have to kick back and take the time to truly appreciate the delicious Chinese food this place has to offer. Things you must try here...1. The pork wok fried potstickers \u00a0(dumplings). Why are these 8 pieces of deliciousness worth trying? The dough has what the Taiwanese would describe as the perfect \" Q Q\" texture. Meaning that shell of the dumpling has a chewiness texture that is firm and has a bit of a bounce as you chew. The bottom of the dumpling has the perfect sear, which provides a delicate crunch factor, \u00a0 hence why it is called a pot - sticker... these are literally just the description of the outside. \u00a0The inside of the dumpling is stuffed with a giant succulent pork meatball that is just mouthwatering delicious. \u00a0The potstickers are served with a vinegar soysauce and hot chili on the side. Both are a great accompaniment to the appetizer. Note that these are fried, \u00a0and as expected will be greasy, but they're not saturated in oil.2. Satay beef ( on a stick). 4 pieces of beef, skewered into a stick. \u00a0It's marinated in a Taiwanese BBQ sauce that is called satay sauce (\u6c99\u7239\u91ac). I can't describe it, but you just have to take my word for it and try it. They're delicious.3. Although I don't have a picture of it cause it was inhaled before it even hit the table... there is a sliced sausage dish you absolutely have to try. \u00a0It comes with slice raw garlic and it's just that good. It's one of those appetizers you need with a beer, specifically a Taiwan beer (\u53f0\u7063\u5564\u9152). 4. Beef chow fun with pan fried flat rice noodles , bean sprouts, and \u00a0green onions. It's a delicious noodle and beefy dish. A bit on the greasy side, but keep in mind it is fried noodles. 5. Hong Huah lobster, \u00a0which is literally one whole lobster seasoned with the restaurant's secret spices and coated in drawn butter over a bed of steam broccoli. \u00a0I can't quite describe the spices, however it is delicious. \u00a0The lobster itself was cooked to perfection. \u00a0The spices was a great accompaniment. I would have prefer to have control of how much butter I consume though I will have to make a mental note to ask of it can be place on the side the next time.6. Fish filet with a veggie melody. \u00a0Little chunks of white fish coated in what tasted like a tempura batter, light salty sauce, and the veggies consist of pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots, and bamboo shoots. Overall, the restaurant provides delicious and large portions of foods at a very reasonable price. The decor is dated. The service is slow, but the staff is friendly. This is a small family own restaurant for over 25+ years. This place is a small hidden gem in the neighborhood and dare I say, better than some of the places in Chinatown?

Rolled in on a Saturday night and the place was bustling - note, a) get a reservation, and b) if you're going with anyone who is eligible for the senior discount at the movies, ask to be in the back room, which is a quiet respite from the slightly louder front section.Started with tempura green beans, edamame, tuna tartare, and grilled calamari. Standout was the tartare - tuna was fresh and mild - and the bed of guac on which it was served was a cool, luscious complement - though if you're not a \"mush\" texture person, make sure you load it onto one of the chips that accompanies it, or else you'll think it's gross. The yuzu/sake/jalapeno/oyster shooter also on the plate was a bit random, but happily slurped by yours truly. Citrusy, spicy, salty. Yum.Grilled calamari had a nice spring to it, but didn't send me over the moon - the balsamic reduction needed more bite and my tentacles were a little overly charred, erring on gassy-tasting. Other starters include a duck liver mousse, hibachi waygu, a few salads, and two obligatory maki rolls...though honestly it's not a place I would order sushi. I'm sure the quality is good, it just seems forced.For mains we went with the bouillabaisse (loup de mer, lobster, cherrystones in a miso butter broth), the skate wing/trout special, and the black cod bento box (served w tofu, hoshimenji shroom rice, cinnamon-y gobo, and miso kampyo) - Stevo loved his 'baisse - and it was an effing monster of a plate - like two people could be happy with it - the fish in my bento box was flaky, moist perfection - and the gobo and kampyo were banging, though the rice and tofu were less flavorful/successful - and my mama was suitably pleased with her skate and trout.I sampled everything - and it's interesting - the flavors that he puts in each dish are really more an amalgamation of Europe (beet beurre blanc, cornichons, etc), with the occasional nod to his country of birth (shiso micro greens, wasabi remoulade) - but it's really not a Japanese place, which is okay - the food was great, the portions are huge, and the presentation is gorgeous in a 1997 way (carved veggies, etc) - somehow, all of these disparate parts come together and the meal was quite pleasant.Save room for dessert - the chocolate mousse w berries was simultaneously light and decadent, as was the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake with espresso.And, before I forget, service was ace - our waiter was the most lovely man - he's been with Yoshi for 22y - \u00a0and not only was his knowledge of the menu really helpful, it was pretty cute to see the real love they have for each other.Ummmm din for 3 w/ hella apps, four glasses of wine, three entrees, and three desserts is...idk...pricey...I think you can drop $100/pp here without even thinking abt it - though if you're not throwing down for apps/dessert, most entrees are around $30, so you could get away with doing it more cheaply - probably plan on at least $50/pp, incl tax/tip.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 10, 19]}, "11": {"description": "A friend recommended that we come here.

Rolled in on a Saturday night and the place was bustling - note, a) get a reservation, and b) if you're going with anyone who is eligible for the senior discount at the movies, ask to be in the back room, which is a quiet respite from the slightly louder front section.Started with tempura green beans, edamame, tuna tartare, and grilled calamari. Standout was the tartare - tuna was fresh and mild - and the bed of guac on which it was served was a cool, luscious complement - though if you're not a \"mush\" texture person, make sure you load it onto one of the chips that accompanies it, or else you'll think it's gross. The yuzu/sake/jalapeno/oyster shooter also on the plate was a bit random, but happily slurped by yours truly. Citrusy, spicy, salty. Yum.Grilled calamari had a nice spring to it, but didn't send me over the moon - the balsamic reduction needed more bite and my tentacles were a little overly charred, erring on gassy-tasting. Other starters include a duck liver mousse, hibachi waygu, a few salads, and two obligatory maki rolls...though honestly it's not a place I would order sushi. I'm sure the quality is good, it just seems forced.For mains we went with the bouillabaisse (loup de mer, lobster, cherrystones in a miso butter broth), the skate wing/trout special, and the black cod bento box (served w tofu, hoshimenji shroom rice, cinnamon-y gobo, and miso kampyo) - Stevo loved his 'baisse - and it was an effing monster of a plate - like two people could be happy with it - the fish in my bento box was flaky, moist perfection - and the gobo and kampyo were banging, though the rice and tofu were less flavorful/successful - and my mama was suitably pleased with her skate and trout.I sampled everything - and it's interesting - the flavors that he puts in each dish are really more an amalgamation of Europe (beet beurre blanc, cornichons, etc), with the occasional nod to his country of birth (shiso micro greens, wasabi remoulade) - but it's really not a Japanese place, which is okay - the food was great, the portions are huge, and the presentation is gorgeous in a 1997 way (carved veggies, etc) - somehow, all of these disparate parts come together and the meal was quite pleasant.Save room for dessert - the chocolate mousse w berries was simultaneously light and decadent, as was the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake with espresso.And, before I forget, service was ace - our waiter was the most lovely man - he's been with Yoshi for 22y - \u00a0and not only was his knowledge of the menu really helpful, it was pretty cute to see the real love they have for each other.Ummmm din for 3 w/ hella apps, four glasses of wine, three entrees, and three desserts is...idk...pricey...I think you can drop $100/pp here without even thinking abt it - though if you're not throwing down for apps/dessert, most entrees are around $30, so you could get away with doing it more cheaply - probably plan on at least $50/pp, incl tax/tip.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 10, 19]}, "43": {"description": "Have been a few times and meant to update my review...Yoshi's is still consistently delicious with so many unique menu options.Major highlight is their vegan whole kabocha squash, filled w/veggies & tofu in this dreamy broth.

And the bread was just bread, nothing to dip it in, nothing to spread on it. The wine list is nice, but it is quite expensive, especially for such a small glass of it. We each only had one glass and the waiter seemed like he really wanted us to have more. Not for $11.50. The salad was amazing. I've not had such a simple yet such a delicious salad like that. The lemon vinaigrette was the perfect complement to the fresh greens. My salmon was also delicious. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly, and sat on a bed of polenta and tomato sauce. It was a light, yet thoroughly satisfying meal. My dessert of apple tart was also healthy-seeming, as it was made of more apples than tart, and the dab of ice cream on top was small, yet flavorful.

Yes but that is not where your delivery driver is because our address is not a church we are between this street & this street. 10 minutes later lunch arrived. Yes it was cold. driver hands it over & says your total is ..... Wait just a minute that is not the price I was given or confirmed with from your website the receipt he handed me was around $2.00 more. So I called the store & was put on hold multiple times to speak to the one woman who takes care of \"take out\" orders. While waiting I hand the Driver a large bill to pay for my meal informing him I will only pay the price I was Confirmed at but will send him back with both receipts. He informed me he did not have change for that large of a bill. When I placed the order I added a note requesting that they bring enough change to break it. They obviously ignored that part of the order or their system just doesn't work right. He was nice & walked down the block leaving his wallet as collateral to buy something & break the bill for me. I eventually spoke to someone at the restaurant who informed me that sometimes prices change! Yes but I did not order off of the menu I ordered off of your website where the pricing should be accurate. There was a note when you first log on the website stating a 20% discount would apply to your first order which would be close to the difference but shouldn't they then be aware of that when they are ringing the order up in on site? I ended up paying what I was confirmed & she apologized for the issues. I reheated the Taco, Tostada & Enchilada in our microwave. The rice & beans I skipped because I did try them while they were cold & they didn't really have any flavor. The guac. was OK, the chips were just chips. The taco was good there was a good amount of steak I did pull out a couple of pieces of fat but it wasn't the whole taco so it didn't bother me. The chicken enchilada was a little skimpy compared to the amount of meat on the taco but still had good flavor.

However, they have recently moved from their previous address near Belmont and Menard to near Belmont and Parkside (early 2013) and I fear the original reviews reflected the older location.The new location resides in what used to be a sushi restaurant. The food here is edible but lacking in flavor. I've had the fried shrimp appetizer and the shrimp fried rice as a carry out order, and the jumbo shrimp fried rice and kung pao shrimp when dining in.My first visit was carry out. The fried shrimp had too much batter and it tasted like it was fried in old oil. The shrimp and batter was tasteless but had plenty of grease to it. The shrimp fried rice looked edible and delicious, but, again, it was lacking flavor. I had to add soy sauce every so often to avoid my taste buds from getting bored.My second visit was dine in. The jumbo fried rice had more flavor than the regual probably due to the bell pepper that was added in. The jumbo shrimp lacked any flavor (again) and I proceeded to add soy sauce (once again). The shrimp kung pao wasn't spicy at all! The menu marked the shrimp kung pao as spicy, but it was severely missing. Once again, the shrimp lacked flavor. The sauce also lacked flavor (yes, more soy sauce).When I dined in, the water I received was room temperature instead of cold.The menu for dining in is different than for carry out. The dine in menu lacked most of the smaller size entree options and the dinner specials that are listed on the website's menu.Summary: The shrimp items that I've ordered lack any flavor. Expect to use soy sauce to add some life to your order. I was served room temperature water instead of water with ice that restaurants usually serve to customers. It seems like the dinner specials and small entree sizes are only for carry-out. Thus making it cheaper to do carry out than dine-in.

Possibly better in restaurant - but the service we received - for a fairly large dollar order - was absolutely abysmal. Delivery was late, and half of our food was missing (an entire dinner missing, not something minor like a bag of chips or a side - this was a full dinner missing!). The delivery person was pleasant but instead of simply saying she would take care of it, started mildly freaking out and literally settled into my living room (while the half order of food sat in its bag, getting colder and colder) making repeated phone calls to the restaurant, who kept hanging up on her or putting her on hold. When a 'manager' finally took the call, they said \"Well? So? What do you want ME to do about it??!\" \"the driver doesn't want to go out just for one dinner!!\" (we are +/- a mile from their restaurant) Eventually, after some discussion with my husband (who was nicer about this insanity than I would have been) someone at the restaurant finally figured out :: big sigh :: \u00a0that they would send someone else with the rest of our food that we had paid for, and the first delivery person (finally) left our living room, where she had been camped out for over a half an hour. While waiting for delivery number two with the rest of our dinner, we decided to go ahead and eat the other (now sodden and ice cold) food..What we ate was - of course - cold but also we were really disappointed to see that the tacos we ordered were not made with only cilantro and onion as described on the menu, but instead were made 'American style' full of lettuce and shredded cheese and tomatoes which we did not ask for or want. My feeling was that they somehow decided we were \"gueros\" because we ordered thru Grubhub and thus gave us everything guero style (including bad service?). Another 30 minutes passes and no sign of our remaining food. Then we get a mysterious phone call.. Caller puts us on hold (??!!) a few minutes someone picks up and says - in a really rude tone of voice 'YOUR FOOD IS ALREADY THERE!' and then they hang up ( ??!!!?? ).We look outside. No food. No delivery driver. Nada.10 more minutes pass - driver calls us and says our 'food is here, come get it.. ' We look outside, driver is parked a half block away, expecting us to come to HIS car (!!??)My husband tells him NO, bring the food to the door, so they guy finally actually brings us our food. Now keep in mind here, we live in a quiet residential neighborhood, lots of parking, mostly folks over 55 -- and this guy is acting all sketchy and weird, like he is delivering drugs to a war zone.

Not only did he rush through the process but he did a very messy job. I have bubbles on all my nails and some edges are not painted ( I could have done a better job myself at home.)

He seemed to get pretty annoyed that the sensory from the UV light machine kept shutting off every time I moved my fingers -which only happen 3 times. He seemed to expect me to know that this machine had a sensor and I shouldn't move at all. He did raise his voice a little and told me to stop moving but when I returned the same attitude back he calmed down. He then in a more calmer tone told me it's a new uv light machine that it sensored not like the timed ones I'm use too but, that would have been nice if he would of mention in the beginning.The nails came out ok not great. \u00a0He didn't even bother to ring me up to pay sent someone else..

Tom Ka: broth too sweet - overloaded with SUGAR (again?) , very little chicken or veg in it, again a crapload of poorly cooked onions and no rice provided with it. We also foolishly tried Maki - awful, rice was warm, mushy and unpleasant. Just gross - and expensive, to boot.Very sad to have to give this place a poor rating, after enjoying it in the past, but can no longer recommend it :(", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 5, 17]}, "21": {"description": "I have been going to Jasmine Rice for about 3 years now (the new/current owners were already there when I started going). Amazing, friendly service as soon as I walked in. They smiled and asked if I was dining in, and asked to pick any table (sweet!). It's a small, family oriented restaurant. I dine in with my family and I have small children. The owner's daughter is nice enough to bring paper and crayons to another table and invite my daughters over so they can draw and color. My husband and I were able to eat in peace. The food is amazing! Thai food is my favorite type of food outside of my own :-) \u00a0I have eaten at many other \"Thai\" restaurants, and none of them compare to Jasmine Rice. The only Thai restaurant I can say compares or probably a little better, is in a far suburb about 45 minutes away. Jasmine Rice is the best Thai food in this area. We always get the Chicken Basil Fried Rice. The amount is just perfect to fill you up. If you're a small eater, then you might have leftovers. If you're really hungry, I recommend you order an appetizer...my favorite Pot Stickers. \u00a0After my meal, I take a Thai Iced Coffee to go...DELICIOUS!!! Oh, I almost forgot! They also give you those delicious guava flavored candies with your check. I'm quite surprised of the negative ratings on here. When we returned for our second time (couple of months later) they remembered us from before! We have been extremely happy with this place, and have recommended it to many of our friends.

Well 7pm rolls around, and no mattress shows. My dad contacts the store,and they say they have to call him back. Instead of getting a call from the store,he gets a call from WI. The driver says he'll show up in 30 mins. But he never shows. Needless to say, the next day I cancelled the transaction, because if they can't deliver a mattress on time and communicate, I don't want to experience having to redeem the warranty.

Not a very complicated order.The couple that was seated when we arrived received their meal shortly after we were seated. So, it stands to reason that no other guests were waiting to be served.It was understood that it was noon, typically a busy time for restaurants. We saw only 1 carry out order picked up during the time we were there, just in case we were thinking that there were a great number of orders for carry out, which would account for the delay in getting our food. If that was the case, we were never informed.It took 57 minutes for our order to arrive and it was missing one sandwich. We then had to quickly ask the server to wrap the order to go. It took an additional 10 minutes for the order to be completed.. and the waitress handed me the bag so I could wrap up my own order. There was no apology, no I'm sorry for the delay, not a word.

I've eaten at fancy Cuban places and holes-in the wall, and this was somewhere in between. The decor feels very dated and very rather unmatched to the tasty morsels you're about to eat, but that's not really the reason you make the trek out west to this place. It really is about the food, of which we had zero gripes.The chicken empanadas and chicken croquetas (chicken seemed to be the only option available that night, but did not disappoint) were perfectly cooked, the marinated meat in the empanada being especially flavorful. I ordered the whole red snapper (\"Are you sure? It still has eyes,\" warned the waitress. I loved it.) was remarkable, entirely moist, crispy, and expertly prepared. My boyfriend's ropa vieja was the ropa vieja I had always hoped to find: not dry, not overpowered by the olive flavor, and well-balanced with its spices. His side of yuca with garlic sauce was phenomenal and my side of black beans and rice was solid, but barely touched on account of my mouth practically shutting things down for the evening.Also remarkable, the sangria: among the only properly-made sangrias I've had in this city, where the white wine actually complimented the fruit. And the flan. Holy crap, the flan. Every bite a gooey, delicate burst of vanilla with the creaminess you rarely find in such custards these days. This was no afterthought dessert. This felt like someone's secret recipe. I made room for it and I was hooked.It's a bit of a trek, and not exactly in a neighborhood with ambiance, but worth it for folks for whom quality preparation is more important than the print on the curtains you'll be staring at.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 5, 12]}, "19": {"description": "Classic Cuban fare.
