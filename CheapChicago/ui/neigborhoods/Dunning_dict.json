I called to complain and was told they would send out a new one. I started eating the previous pizza because they didn't say they wanted it. They called back after 5 minutes and said they want the other pizza back. I already ate two pieces. They didn't want to take it back. They also said they couldn't refund my money ($50.00). The girl admitted to making a mistake when taking the order and that, \"I'll get it right next time.\" WTF!!!Now let's talk about the pizza itself. Very poorly made and incredibly sloppy. Looks like a monkey with no arms made it. We also ordered fried calamari and that was terrible. For the amount of money the pizza and calamari cost me it better knock me out of my seat.

I'm not sure if they have new owners or a new management team, but we feel as if the overall quality has really gone down. We used to dine in a lot, and we would usually have the same server. We really liked her, she was very friendly and attentive. Lately when we have been going, we've noticed a decline in restaurant ambiance, and even the food. Call me crazy, but I feel like there used to be cloth napkins which have now been replaced by paper napkins. They only give you one napkin and it's never enough. The bread is kind of dry, and we have had to send it back a few times for being cold in the middle. I think it may be frozen and they just heat it up real quick before they put it out on the table. We decided to order delivery one Friday night, and I ordered bow tie pasta with oil and garlic, no cheese garnish. An hour and a half passed when we finally got our food, and it was \u00a0completely wrong. They gave me marinara sauce with cheese all over it. That's fine, I understand mistakes, they happen! I called them back and told them what happened, the manager got on the phone and said they would bring one back and that they would throw in a free Italian ice. I waited another hour for my food to get back. I was so upset and cranky by then. I was hungry and my boyfriend had already finished his food...so much for Friday night dinner in together. The worst part is when I got my food, I found a small nasty cartilagey bone in my pasta. I am Vegan, and upon looking at it, I just got so nauseous, I threw away all my food and stayed hungry. My boyfriend hasn't been loving his food from there lately either, and we always get the same thing every time. I don't know if they are cutting cost and budget or what. The people who work there are always nice and polite I have to say.

I didn't want to drive all the way to Portillo's but now I regret not going to Portillo's for my Italian beef fix. \u00a0I should have driven to Portillo's and could kick myself in the ass for not doing so since I ended up throwing out most of my food from this joint. Many, many years ago, I heard about this place from a former student who took one of my courses in graduate school. \u00a0He always raved about \"how fantastic\" their food is especially the \"Italian beef sandwich.\" Every now and again he would arrive with a beef from this place, inhale it before the class started, and then belch, burp and fart throughout the entire class time. \u00a0Disgusting and disruptive...but I digress....I finally got to try this place.....here's the low-down and the breakdown: When I get my beef dipped at Portillo's the bread does not fall apart or crumble in my hands. I can actually eat the beef with both hands without it ever falling apart. \u00a0This was my experience with the bread holding the Italian beef from Mr. Beef & Pizza restaurant. I had to use a plastic knife and fork to eat this mother sucker. WTF, who does that with an Italian beef? \u00a0I ate less than half of the beef, because the beef and au jus itself was oh so bland. Where was/is the flavor for this beef? \u00a0I was really disappointed. However, the positive is that the beef is lean (not fatty), and it is loaded with 1/2 lb. of beef, so they don't skimp on the meat. \u00a0I really, really wanted to like the Italian beef sandwich here. I will not be returning. Another positive is that the service was very friendly and the lady behind the counter greeted me enthusiastically asking \"How are you tonight? What can I get for you?\" \u00a0The service was decent. Positive. It was fast. Positive. This joint does not have a drive through so you have to walk into the restaurant. Not having a drive-thru in 2014? I guess it reflects the \"mom and pop\" image of the old days. However, today this is considered outdated. The parking lot is small and tight with patches of ice throughout the parking lot. Dangerous. If you slip and fall and get hurt in their parking lot it is a law suit waiting to happen for this business. I am not a french fries fan, but thought maybe they would be like the fries from Portillo's. Wrong again. The positive is that the fries are enough for three people to share -- huge! The negative is that the fries tasted frozen (definitely not fresh). I ended up throwing the fries in the garbage after eating two or three. The bread was like a freakin' sponge. It was probably the worst bread I've ever had (the texture was very weird -- sponge-like and it fell apart). \u00a0The Au Jus was tasteless. I couldn't even eat the entire beef. \u00a0I gave my dog, Annie, a little bit of the beef meat. She seemed to enjoy it more than I did -- but she'll eat anything! \u00a0Unlike me, Annie cannot tell the difference between Portillo's beef and this joint's beef. \u00a0The rest of the beef went in the garbage too. \u00a0What lesson did I learn? \u00a0I learned that I WILL drive out of my way and get my ass over to Portillo's the next time I want an Italian beef sandwich -- wait a minute -- the BEST Italian beef sandwich is at Portillo's. What the hell was I thinking. \u00a0This place had some positives and negatives, but for me, it was mostly negative. My expectations for this place were high, but in the end, it was a huge let-down.

There were even pictures of the ombre that she had done and they are stunning. As soon as I walked in the salon it looked a little worn down. Lindsey had so many positive reviews I looked past the wear and tear. The staff were super friendly. They offered beverages and made you feel comfortable. After meeting Linsday i felt confident about getting my hair done here. She sounded like she knew what she was doing and had stated ombres were an every day thing for her. I felt at eased. Everything went really well until I seen it dryed. It seemed alittle brassy at first. Then she curled it and it looked cute. Everything looks great when its curled. Today the curls fell out and decided to blow it out to see the final product. Its awful. Its orange and brassy. The bayaloge ombre is very spotchy and looks as if an amateur had done my hair. I am a hair stylist myself and would never allow my clients to walk out of my salon like that. I am very disappointed in the amount I paid and for what my hair looks like now.

When he started with me, instead of relaxing I really want to be done with. He was taking the tools looked them, literally touching my toes instead of cutting cuticles etc etc... Actually, I'm glad that he didn't put effort into it because all the tools, towels and stations look so dirty!!!!The pedicure tools were in the dirty glass in the liquid that looked not being changed for a while. I hope I didn't catch any skin disease!!! After the \u00a0disaster pedicure I still had to stay for manicure since I scheduled appointment for both. I just wanted be fair. And honestly I should leave after pedicure because was the same story with the cuticles that I still had them after having manicure!!!!The job was done so sloppy.!!!He didn't even wipe the polish on the skin around the nails and on top of everything he performed so-called massage with oily disgusting lotion.

The owner, Theresa, was so kind to make us a huge tray of her delicious Vietnamese egg rolls. These egg rolls were super awesome, really! (Sidenote: she sells these huge trays of huge Vietnamese egg rolls for about $25)If you think the egg rolls were great, the mani/pedi was superb. They start you off in their massaging leather chairs with your feet in the relaxing, hot, blue water. During the spa pedicure, they apply a beaded scrub to your calves and feet. And, this nail salon has been the first one to ever apply a scrub to my legs, which was awesome! After the scrub, they apply a citrus-grapefruit lotion on my legs equipped with a mini-massage.

Awesome! I work with kids, and wash my hands about a thousand times a day - I need something to last more than a few days. They've redesigned the salon since the last time I was here. And I had a great experience the last time I was here, because it felt just a little more private per nail station. The front of the salon is still for manicure stations, but instead of individual tables, there are two long tables, with a UV lamp/fan attached to each station. That's pretty nice, and prevents that whole clunky machine from being put on the table. I personally hate the setup, as I'm on top of other people and technicians. They don't even have a front desk anymore, just a tiny table with something to show the menu and prices, and barely enough room for a clipboard to sign in. The register and credit card machine are in a little nook in the corner. I sat down and was told that my technician was finishing his lunch, so I would be waiting for a few minutes. WHAT? I definitely understand someone needing to eat their lunch, but to tell me that is awful. Who wants to feel like they are rushing someone's lunch, especially because when they finished, they had to do something for you? There was one technician there (with very short hair), who was clearly popular and had personal relationships with some of the other customers, but they did not (do not) have one with me. I don't want to hear another technician refer to another person as a b****, because I don't know if she is talking about a customer or another technician. At one point, I misheard my technician, who didn't speak loudly, and this technician first laughed at me, and then had their customer laugh at me as well. She had the audacity to ask me if I'd been drinking too much. They also started talking about the big turnover in technicians. Kyle (my technician, at least that's the name I caught) clearly looked uncomfortable at this exchange, so brownie points for him. My nails look nice, but not how I really wanted them to look. I wanted a thinner line for the white polish, and my nails aren't square or round, but kind of like softened trapezoids. My cuticles look great, though, and they're usually my biggest problem. A forearm and hand massage was a part of this manicure, and I'm glad I was asked to pay when my manicure was dry. I will not be back to this salon - the rude technician ruined this salon for me, and I would never want them as my technician if I do another walk-in appointment.", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 6, 23]}, "17": {"description": "Anne is very good and remembers what you like.does a great pedicure and massage on your legs.

They are completely peeling now. Painful! The next day my cuticles were peeling, looked as though I had never gotten them cleaned and my nail polish started chipping. I went this morning to get them re-done. My 2nd visit was the nail on the coffin for this place.I \u00a0walked in at 9am and was greeted by Jenny. I shared with Jenny I was in 3 days prior and my polish was already chipping after paying extra for the polish. She asked who took care of me and when I identified him she had me sit in his chair and shared that he would take care of me. Painless. The gentleman asked which nails needed touch up and I shared they all did. I thought he would re-do them. No, he added a coat of color and layer of top coat. I might as well have just done no chip!

Woohoo! Some of this might be because we followed instructions when planting and have good soil, but even with those measures taken, if you buy an unhealthy plant, it will die no matter how well you care for it. Also, we have a reputation around here for killing plants, so I am now convinced that Pesche's sells only healthy, hardy plants to its customers.Unfortunately, there's a lot of emphasis on and promotion of non-native, invasive plant species, just like at most garden centers around here. I understand the \"tropical\" department is really meant to be houseplants, but there were plants like Japanese Barberry that are meant to grow outside but are invasive and dangerous to grow in your yard, as they'll likely spread to other areas and crowd out native plants. They do also sell non-invasive alternatives to these plants--for example, Ninebark is similar--but I haven't seen employees actively promoting these better alternatives. In fact, there are signs encouraging people who want to attract hummingbirds and butterflies to purchase flowers from a list Pesche's has devised, and on that list are several invasive flowers alongside native species. I understand that there's a demand for these dangerous plants, but I feel like if garden centers actively promoted local species (and after talking with the staff when planning our own flowerbed, we know they are knowledgeable enough to do this), the demand for exotic invasive plants would decrease.Aside from that, Pesche's is a great place with a lot of history and a lot of inventory. Coyote problems? You can purchase humanely-harvested coyote urine to scare off the furry critters from a rack right underneath a picture of JFK taken when he was in the area for a parade. Need a trellis? There are many to choose from, and while you browse you can wonder if a German prisoner of war stood where you're standing during WWII , because down River Road a bit there once existed a prison camp who used Pesche's for their work program. (That's right, if you lived in Des Plaines in the 1940's and had flowers delivered to you, the delivery man may have been a Nazi spy.) Do you need window decals to decrease bird strikes? You can buy them here while contemplating the hard work and dedication that goes into handing a business like this down from generation to generation.This place gets crazy busy at certain times, and you'll see police directing traffic in and out of the parking lot. My advice? Stay away on those days. Somebody is likely to tackle you in a greenhouse over the last petunia tray on Mother's Day. You can come back next weekend; there will be more. In fact, if they don't have what you want, you can ask in person or call to find out when what you need will be in stock. We, for example, showed up two weeks before they put out their coneflower sproutings, and they told us exactly when to come back to get some.Overall, I'd like to give Pesche's five stars because I love family-owned businesses with excellent service and great inventory, but I don't think I can as long as they're encouraging people to buy plants that destroy local ecosystems and/or require excessive chemical fertilization and watering to survive in Illinois.

Also, you can find unique plants that you will NOT find at your local Home DePot garden center. I am passionate about gardening, creating unique and beautiful containers myself, and doing my own hanging baskets. I get this passion from my Dad who is an award-winning gardener (in the area of roses). I love their variety of perennials and annuals, which provide a pop of color when nothing else is blooming. The lines can get long at the end of May and even the day before Mother's Day, but they move quickly and they have plenty of young college students helping out at the registers. I do not know of any professional nursery that will \"Guarantee\" their trees or any other species and provide a money-back guarantee. They have beautiful, lush, healthy hanging baskets and sell lots of \"Proven Winners\" (these are annuals). I love the variety of Coleus plants too. Last year, I combined the dark maroon with lime green coleus plants for a pop of color in a small area of our backyard garden. These do very well in early morning sun and need shade in the afternoon. These are lush and grow to 12 inches in height. They look fantastic in our garden. \u00a0If you pinch off the flowers they will bloom again throughout the summer months.I purchased a white fragrant Japanese crab apple tree from here about 10 years ago. My father helped me plant it and it is the centerpiece of our front yard. We have several mature trees on the side of our house (we have a corner lot that is huge in Chicago). This crab apple tree blooms beautifully every Spring. It is now a mature tree. Every time someone walks by our house I notice people standing there admiring it and taking in a deep breath to get a whiff of the light, sweet fragrance that it produces. The flowers are white with a deep pink center. Every time that tree blooms I think of my Dad. I also purchased a deep purple Peony Tree (which is now 5 ft tall and 4 ft wide) about the same time. The flowers are about 10 inches wide (they look like giant pom-poms). Both have thrived in our front yard, and have provided years of beautiful blooms. I know Spring has officially arrived when our crab apple tree and peony tree burst open with beautiful blooms. I have never experienced any issues with anything that I have purchased at Pesche's Garden Center. This is a family-owned business that is now in their fourth generation.

I'm officially a hipster; can hipsters be plus size? Do they usually surround themselves in this much color? Can they be dorky and clumsy? I'm not sure, but in any case, those are all me, and yet I feel like a hipster (in the best way) in this artsy coffee shop/cafe. Perkolator is like my version of hipster heaven. Or maybe espresso nirvana? So yes, atmosphere is everything. First off, great tunes played over a great sound system or speakers. \u00a0I love the vividly colored & wallpapered walls adorned with local artists' work for sale, and the bright, open feel of the dining area, and the creaky wood floors. I love that there are games and toys for kids to play with and board games for adults (sorry, no adult toys, this ain't that kind of place). I love the friendly and patient baristas and staff as well, always inviting. And before I get into the menu, if all that wasn't enough atmosphere, this just put Perkaltor over the top for me: they've opened an adjoining (dare I say Sci-fi) retro lounge area in the space next door filled with vinyl records and books to peruse! If playing with old clunky typewriters, turntables and telephones are your thing, you will most certainly appreciate the decor and retro lighting. Oh, did I mention the Ray-gun? There's a ray-gun, people!! And Star Trek posters, and a huge spaceman Martian and spaceship painted on one wall. If they had comic books, I'm quite certain the Big Bang Theory characters would hang out here. I may be mixing genres, but I just don't care. Enough-- on to the menu. Think breakfast sandwiches (which recently got a nod on Chicagoist, check it out), pastries and also bistro lunch options such as soups, greens, grilled cheese, paninis, and so on. Btw, these are some of the best scones ever. I suggest you seriously check out the pastry case.As for coffee drinks, I believe they have their own Perkolator brand in a variety of blends, in addition to sometimes featuring guest roasters (past ones have been Intelligentsia, Dark Matter, Metropolis, etc). Can we talk about dairy & non dairy options for a minute? They have got them all. Does your local barista offer HEMP milk? No? Well they should. I'm all about options and that's one you don't often see. (P.S. I tried it in my latte and enjoyed it.) They have all the usual suspects of dairy, plus, soy, almond, macadamia, coconut and hemp milk. This makes me happy. Not into coffee? There's also cold and hot teas, Italian sodas, milk, and possibly regular soda (I've never noticed)? Trust me when I say, this little place is a winner. Quaint, charming, retro, roomy, interesting, tasty. What more do you need? Wi-fi, maybe? Shut up, hipster.

And a tomato bisque to go along with it (so yummy! It was not too thick and not too watery it was perfect). I also ordered a baklava for dessert, a little hard but delicious nonetheless. I enjoyed everything so much I grabbed a bagel with cream cheese to go. Definitely coming back here! If you're in the area you have to stop by! And if you're not make your way over anyways!

They came out about 30 minutes after we ordered them, and they were just OK. They seemed a bit oversone, as they were difficult to cut. I also wish they had been served with some kind of sauce, as they were a bit dry.Out entrees took another 30 minutes after the appetizer to arrive. For my main meal, I had the combination which was steak, chicken, yuca, sweet plantain, and potato, served with a small amount of chimichurri sauce. And when I saw \"a small amount,\" I mean, a VERY small amount. I love chimichurri sauce, and would have enjoyed much more with my dish. The meats were both cooked well, but the yuca was dry. More sauce would have done quite a bit to the dish. My husband had the bandeja paisa, which was steak with rice, egg, beans, a flat bread and pork rind. He enjoyed his dish, agreeing the meat was cooked well, but he barely touched his pork rind as it was really fatty and very very fried.We didn't have room for dessert, so no comments there. Our total was over $60, before tax and tip.

You also should turn off your cell phone. My friend advised me ahead of time to wear white socks, because you pick up salt dust.The room itself is dimly lit with salt lamps. There is about two or three inches of thick salt on the floor. The pillars are made of salt blocks. Stalagtites (stalagmites? I can never remember which is which.) hang from the ceiling. There are about 15 patio chairs which can recline. One corner is separated and asks like a sand box for children, even equipped with a couple buckets and shovels, but it is full of salt, not sand. Soft music is piped in. There are also several light blankets piled on one chair, so you can cover yourself if it gets cool (temperature is about 70 degrees), or you can do as we did, put a blanket on the salt-covered floor and just relax.When your hours starts, there is a voice-over giving you simple instructions. It suggests you walk around the room for 5-10 minutes to get accustomed to the salt, and maybe even just hold some salt in your hands while you do so. So, we did do that.Afterwards, I reclined in a chair for a few minutes, but then I decided to lay down.

There are cubbies for your shoes, and it is recommended that you bring a pair of clean socks to enter the cave. No bare feet allowed. Keep in mind the whole place is pretty small, and they prefer silence in the waiting area as not to disturb patrons already in the cave. There are no magazines, and with no small talk allowed, its really best to get there fairly close (within 10 minutes) to your reservation time.The reception desk does their best to schedule \"like\" patrons together, so its good to mention if you are bringing kids (or not) so that they can plan the best experience for you. If you are bringing kids, there is an area in the corner with beach toys that the kids are welcome to play with. The large grains of salt have the same play quality as sand, so it can be a fun outing for even the little folks. Be warned however, the munchkins will probably be covered in fine white powder residue at the end of the session, so don't expect them to leave here 100% presentable! If you are not bringing kids, be sure to ask if there are all adult sessions so that you can relax/nap and don't have to listen to little shrieks of delight or 45 minutes of gravely shoveling noises. Adults get to lie in zero gravity beach chairs and just \"rest.\"The cave itself is a little Disneyesque, and very pretty. \u00a0All white salt walls, ceiling and floor with multi-colored lights, piped in ocean sounds and cuddly white blankets all create a very peaceful atmosphere. The air is truly saturated with salt, and it reminds me of being at the ocean times 2. At the ocean you can really smell the salt, but here if you breathe really deeply through your mouth, you can taste it too. Since salt is an anti-microbial substance, it makes sense that breathing microparticals for 45 minutes might help the respiratory stuff that ails you. \u00a0I think the combination of down time, relaxing environment AND salt air really does leave anyone who comes feeling better than when they came. \u00a0I thought it *might* be a little gimmicky at first, but after 3 visits and reading about socialized medicine in the UK using the same salt caves for treatment of asthmatic children....

There are cubbies for your shoes, and it is recommended that you bring a pair of clean socks to enter the cave. No bare feet allowed. Keep in mind the whole place is pretty small, and they prefer silence in the waiting area as not to disturb patrons already in the cave. There are no magazines, and with no small talk allowed, its really best to get there fairly close (within 10 minutes) to your reservation time.The reception desk does their best to schedule \"like\" patrons together, so its good to mention if you are bringing kids (or not) so that they can plan the best experience for you. If you are bringing kids, there is an area in the corner with beach toys that the kids are welcome to play with. The large grains of salt have the same play quality as sand, so it can be a fun outing for even the little folks. Be warned however, the munchkins will probably be covered in fine white powder residue at the end of the session, so don't expect them to leave here 100% presentable! If you are not bringing kids, be sure to ask if there are all adult sessions so that you can relax/nap and don't have to listen to little shrieks of delight or 45 minutes of gravely shoveling noises. Adults get to lie in zero gravity beach chairs and just \"rest.\"The cave itself is a little Disneyesque, and very pretty. \u00a0All white salt walls, ceiling and floor with multi-colored lights, piped in ocean sounds and cuddly white blankets all create a very peaceful atmosphere. The air is truly saturated with salt, and it reminds me of being at the ocean times 2. At the ocean you can really smell the salt, but here if you breathe really deeply through your mouth, you can taste it too. Since salt is an anti-microbial substance, it makes sense that breathing microparticals for 45 minutes might help the respiratory stuff that ails you. \u00a0I think the combination of down time, relaxing environment AND salt air really does leave anyone who comes feeling better than when they came. \u00a0I thought it *might* be a little gimmicky at first, but after 3 visits and reading about socialized medicine in the UK using the same salt caves for treatment of asthmatic children....

According to the web site, the mystical healing powers of the Black Sea salt (imported from Poland and replaced every 2 months) can alleviate a variety of ailments, from skin disorders to \"neuroses.\" Also according to their web site, their hours are 9 am to 9 pm, but when we called, the machine said that their \"summer hours\" are 11 am to something (\"Summer?\" it's October! \u00a0Update the website...) Got there at 11, and a group with a toddler was also there, who warned us that if we were looking for a restful experience, we might not want to go in with them, since the toddler would be, well, a toddler. Thanks! We went out to lunch and came back at noon, when we went in with a group of mostly old ladies (much quieter than the toddler, though one started hacking up a hairball halfway through the 45 minute session -- the salt air *is* supposed to be good for your sinuses...). Entering into the cave through the reception room, you feel like you're going into some Narnia world. Blacklights enhance the colors of the salt stalactites, and chunks of pink salt (like the salt lamps for sale out in the lobby) glow from the room's central pillar and the walls like huge knobs of rose quartz. You're encouraged to walk around the cave for 5-10 minutes to stimulate circulation; there's not a lot of floor space, so everyone just sort of milled around in a circle around the central pillar like people doing a zen meditation walk. The rock salt has a gravelly texture and is a bit difficult to walk on, though your feet get a nice reflexology treatment through your regulation white socks as you shuffle along. Be sure to pick up some of the salt and massage it between your palms too for the same effect. After a while everyone settled into the comfy lounge chairs (except one old lady who did some tai chi in the corner for a while), the lights dimmed except for the glowing pink chunks in the walls, and we all mellowed out. The temperature is 70 degrees, the receptionist said, though it seemed chilly to me; polar fleece blankets are thoughtfully provided. The music could have used some variety; apparently the CD we were listening to must have been something like \"The Many Moods of Pachabel,\" because we heard like 5 versions of \"Canon\" (Canon with waves! Canon with seabirds! Canon with New Age spaceship sounds! Canon with moody randomly plucked guitar string accompaniment!)...and then the same CD started over again! Put something else in the changer, please.Overall, it was a relaxing, unusual way to spend an hour. Nowhere near home for me, but we made a day trip of it, so it was worthwhile.

There is about two or three inches of thick salt on the floor. The pillars are made of salt blocks. Stalagtites (stalagmites? I can never remember which is which.) hang from the ceiling. There are about 15 patio chairs which can recline. One corner is separated and asks like a sand box for children, even equipped with a couple buckets and shovels, but it is full of salt, not sand. Soft music is piped in. There are also several light blankets piled on one chair, so you can cover yourself if it gets cool (temperature is about 70 degrees), or you can do as we did, put a blanket on the salt-covered floor and just relax.When your hours starts, there is a voice-over giving you simple instructions. It suggests you walk around the room for 5-10 minutes to get accustomed to the salt, and maybe even just hold some salt in your hands while you do so. So, we did do that.Afterwards, I reclined in a chair for a few minutes, but then I decided to lay down.

I am very fortunate to have found Velintina's Salon because this place is exactly the kind of salon I've been searching for! My haircut was done by one of the owners, Tina. She was very courteous and REALLY listened to me when I explain the type of cut I would like to have. She was patient with me and gave me very helpful suggestions. I am the type of person who searches for excellent customer service and I have found it here! In the past, I have been to all different types of hair salons in many major cities, as well as overseas. I've noticed that not all $100+ haircut automatically equal awesome service and friendly atmosphere. I am a bit old-fashioned in the sense that I prefer my hair stylist to be a down-to-earth person who I can trust my hair with and allows me a chance to enjoy this \"pamper-me\" time. I like the \"friendly neighborhood\" feel of smaller establishments, and mom-n-pop-shops. I don't want people to be fake to me, or pushy, to just to get me to spend money on extra services I don't want (I don't want to color my hair because I can't donate dyed hair). I've also had stylists blatantly show their discontent in front of me, simply because I don't want to purchase the hair products they are trying to push on me. I just prefer very little product in my hair, and whatever products I do have (I have a TON! I own many products from salons I've visited in the past and I'm a huge fan of Sephora & Ulta) are all BARELY used. I LOVE beauty products, but on a daily basis, I like to wear very little makeup and zero hair products. I would much rather spend that money I would've wasted on another product that sits and collects dust in the back of my cabinet or drawer, on tipping my stylist for an amazing haircut/style.That being said, I am ECSTATIC about my experience at Velintina's Salon. I LOVE my haircut (so does my boyfriend & mother) and I felt that it was a very serene, cozy environment for my retreat from the world. Tina is very skilled and attentive to my requests. She took her time with my blowdry and styling my hair. A lot of the stylists I've been to have rushed through my blowdry or didn't ask what I would want done and just went straight for the flat-iron (I have somewhat wavy hair and there is lots of it). Tina asked me if it would be okay to curl some pieces of hair, and explained what products she was adding to my hair and DID NOT become an annoying salesperson by pressuring me to purchase any products (Thank you Tina!!! I cannot stand pushy people). I highly recommend Velintina's Salon and will keep coming back here for future beauty services :)", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 12, 6]}, "0": {"description": "Based on yelp reviews, I decided to go in for a trim with Gabby.

Since we had already had dinner elsewhere, we decided to order a dessert. It was delicious! I can't wait to come back and taste the food.

Nothing happened, but the guy was so embarrassed and apologetic. No harm done we said.

The first time i loved it... that was before I understood anything about hookah. I was 18 the first time I went for my and my best friends 18th Birthday. The staff was kind but the hookah tasted burnt. There was no flavor. I didn't fully understand how hookah worked then. I then went for a second time and got a better understanding. The food was wonderful. A few later later I went my boyfriend on our second date. Food was alright... the shisha list was a joke and they were out of just about everything. The hookahs weren't washed really and they don't keep hookahs separate so if you wanted mint and the hookah had double apple in it before guess what your smoking? That's right it all tastes like double apple. That''s if your lucky. When we went it just tasted like flavorless smoke. So much different stuff in the base i would imagine. As i said the food was good but its so dark in there you can't see anything when the smoke gets bad. The staff was nice but the shisha selection is poor. Starbuzz is not idea for hookah owners. The staff was great, the food was great but honestly that was about it. The smoking experience wasn't at all what I expected it to be. The price per hookah is out outrageous but they do allow some sharing.I would rather go to Ugly Hookah or Prince Hookah. Or well, just stick to smoking at home and inviting friends to come here. Pros: Good Food, Wonderful Staff, Special Treat for birthdays, nice atmosphere, decent music, sharing hookahsCons: Barely washed hookahs, poor selection in shisha, dim lighting, loud music, overcrowded, expensive hookahs, expensive night outEDIT: Side note, for those who like natural coals vs quick lights this is not this place for you.

Not only does your manager know that we're good customers/tippers, but he made me drive from Chicago to Des-Plaines in search of a ID and we drove back to sadly inform him we couldn't find one. He had the audacity to say \"you made a valid effort\" but still declined us to enter Hubble Hookah, and then proceeded to charge us full price for three hookahs, yet there was only two people present, including myself. So not only did your manager deny us the privilege to enter your hookah bar, but he also charged a friend of mine that was waiting inside for us $45 for three hookahs that he didn't even use. I think it would be appropriate that you, as the owner, is aware of the fact that you have rude, parsimonious, impolite staff members.

I hadn't been here in several months, but a friend of mine was visiting me from out of the country and I thought it would be a nice way to spend a Sunday night. Normally, Hubble seems like a nice break from the more traditional old man Arabic hookah lounges. The interior is beautifully decorated and modern. It is a younger crowd and there are good appetizers, although the hookah is not always the best. Sometimes the flavors taste like they are mixed. Perhaps they do not clean the hookahs. You cannot serve double apple in the same hookahs that mint flavors have been smoked out of, but perhaps they just do not understand. All the same, my issue comes with the way customers are treated. I walked in on a Sunday night. It was somewhat crowded, but there were many free tables and spots at the bar. There were a group of girls waiting to be seated. A man came who claimed to be the manager and owner. I thought he was going to seat me and I reminded him that the girls were there before me. He told me he knew and said it would be a 25 minute wait. I asked if I could sit at the bar. I assumed perhaps all the empty tables were reserved. He told me that the problem isn't that there aren't tables, but that they are low on servers. It was a cold night and I didn't feel like driving anywhere else so I decided to wait. Then another group of people came in and as customers were leaving and arriving, we kept having to move away from the entrance. I asked the man if we could just be seated. Although they were low on servers, the polite thing to do would have been to seat all the customers so we could at least wait sitting down without having to stay by the door and be bumped into. Not only was this a rude gesture to customers by this man who claims to be the owner, but its also a fire hazard to have so many people waiting by the entrance. Keep in mind, there were about 5 empty tables and seats at the bar. Even as people left some of the tables and they cleaned them off, they still didn't proceed to seat anybody including the people who were there before me. I asked the man why. Then he proceeded to tell me that if I didn't want to wait I could leave. He also reminded me that there was a party ahead of me. This really got me mad because I wasn't being asked to be seated before them and as a matter of fact, I was even polite enough to initially tell him that the girls had come in before me when he first approached me and said it would be a 25 minute wait. I proceeded to tell another waitress it was ridiculous that they are not seating customers when there are plenty of tables and seats at the bar. I informed her I would write a review on yelp and she ignored me. I have never been treated so rudely in my life. I am a 26 year old woman and I have smoked hookah at all the cafes in Chicago. Not to mention during my many travels in Lebanon and Turkey. I think I will stick to the more traditional cafes like Ugly Hookah, Ali Baba, and Rotana. What happened tonight was the dumbest thing! Even though they were busy and low on servers, I think the customers would have rather waited at a table for 25 minutes than standing up by the entrance being bumped into by customers who were leaving and arriving. This is no way to run a business and its not nice to treat a customer badly who is planning on spending money by telling them they can leave if they like. He really showed me that my business was not appreciated tonight.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 12, 28]}, "17": {"description": "Love this place!

We had to wait like 20-30 mins to for her to come to our table.- I ordered a vodka redbull, and it was way too much vodka. Probably next time will get a redbull.- The place to totally understaff. They should at least have 3-4 servers in the main room and an actual bartender at the bar.- Lastly, the hostress wasnt too happy being there and then we were trying to decide to get another head, she said \"okay\" then left. I work as a bartender and server, and I understand that you can't get to everyone at the same time however, i just had a feeling that the waitress didnt care to tend to me and my friends, however she had paid more attention to tables of men.

I've never had the cuisine before, so we decided on the Magic Jug because the menu looked the most authentic. A small space with an unassuming brick and glass store front, you might miss it if you weren't looking closely. But the moment you step inside, you're magically transported through time and space to a Ukrainian grandma's house! You can see her in the kitchen, rolling out dough, as you sit down amidst the wood-covered walls and traditional woven tablecloths. All around you are traditional paintings of smiling Ukrainian girls, poppies, and mermaids, and a little wooden Ukrainian bear greets you from the napkin holder on the table.The server brought a basket of bread and butter right to our table when we ordered. There were two kinds of bread, one looked plain white, the other was hearty sunflower seed. It had a crust of crunchy sunflowers and what tasted like anise sprinkled across the top. Then came our golubtsi--what my boyfriend calls Ukrainian egg rolls. They are cabbage leaves stuffed with warm meat, rice, and spices and served with fresh dill sprinkled on top and a side of sour cream. The golubtsi were cooked to perfection; the cabbage leaves were soft enough so that you could easily cut through them, making me think they had maybe been boiled, but there was a perfect golden crispness on top. When I get a dish colored in shades of beige and wrapped in cabbage leaves, I expect it will be pretty bland. So I was happily surprised when these unassuming cabbage rolls were bursting with meaty, spicy, herby flavor. The fresh dill and sour cream lightly counterbalanced the savory, warm filling.Next, our pelmeny were served in an earthenware jug, and it really was magical. Pelmeny are small, buttery, chewy dumplings filled with ground meat and onion. They came to us piping hot with a hearty sprinkle of dill on top. When I cut one in half, the buttery, golden sauce it was cooked in came oozing out and made everything else on my plate that much happier. About the size of a golf ball, I could have eaten at least 30 of these. I imagined myself sitting in a wooden Ukrainian hut on a frozen January day, warmed inside and out with a steaming little jug of pelmeny.Last in our tour of savory dishes was the cheburek, a fried meat pie. It was a pocket of dough about the size of a dinner plate folded in half, again filled with spicy ground meat. The meat mixture was similar to the others, spicy, hot, oniony and dilly, and similarly delicious. The dough was freshly made, with a delightful flaky texture fried to golden brown perfection. To finish off the meal, we ordered what was labeled simply as \"sweet\" in the English menu translation. It turned out to be two thin crepe-like pastries filled with a sweet cheese filling, fairly similar to cheese blintzes. The sweets were sprinkled with powdered sugar, drizzled with fruit sauce and served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce on the side. Even though we finished the meal feeling as stuffed as the golubtsi, the bill was surprisingly small!Come to the Magic Jug if you want to be whisked away to delightful Ukrainian flavors, charm, and hospitality.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 9, 8]}, "5": {"description": "You should try this place, it's a small family owned place, ascetically pleasing atmosphere, with Ukrainian/pop music playing in the background, but let's talk about the food.

I pay another $50.00 for an inspector to come look at the mattress and see what the issue is. they find that my box spring is solid and my frame is fine the mattress has a defect BUT they can not change it because the warranty says the mattress must have a inch and a half sag before the warranty can replace the mattress. my mattress only had an inch and a quarter sag. i was informed after speaking to some one at corporate that i had to wait for the mattress to sag another quarter of an inch before they could do anything for me. well i understand we all have procedures but really a quarter of an inch? so Bad back and Sleep Apnea i have to try and sleep on this bed till we get another quarter of an inch in this sag. I now move into a new house and inform The Bedding Experts that i am moving and make sure that my warranty issue is still going to be taken care of because i need to buy split box springs because my full size queen box spring will not make it up the stairs in my new house. $200 later i get box springs from the Skokie location they recommend the box springs i need for the mattress i have so i buy them and get home and set up my bed.At this point i cant even sleep on my bed without actually using a pillow in this valley of a sag i have in my mattress so i stay level in the bed.

Fair enough i wait the 4 weeks and \u00a0nothing. i walk into this location 3 months to the day and was told that my warranty was denied due to the fact that the box springs i had because they did not support the mattress i have. well how can that be when the store recommended that i have those particular box springs for my mattress? No idea. I made one call to corporate, and i have no idea what happened but once they pulled up my info up they told me they were sorry for the inconvenience but if i purchased the correct box springs for another $160 they would credit me for the ones i have now and deliver my new mattress and box springs at this point just desperate for a good night sleep i buy the new box springs and have my new bed delivered a week later. were on mattress number 3!! and if we are doing the math...

I was with the kids in the area and after playing, so we came in for a quick dinner. I got a Maxwell Polish and my son got a plain hot dog. The baby was going to share some of our fries and onion rings, plus stuff I brought just for him. Strike 1: A high chair was not an option since they had none. There was a lone black table but all the seats were tall stools on which it's hard to sit for a kid and reach the countertop. So we thought we'd take this table instead. Strike 2: The table had a dried-up sticky spot that covered about 90% of its surface. Seeing this mess, I let my 23-month old son eat off the countertop instead while semi-standing on the stool. If he was not a stunt-baby at home, I probably would have been terrified of his eating position standing about 3 feet off the ground. He proved his balance and agility to be superb as he made it through the meal without falling off the stool.I was unimpressed with my Polish. I wasn't sure if it's Vienna Beef, as I saw no signage for Vienna inside. That's a bad omen, if you ask me. The only decor on the walls was a faded little league sponsorship photo plaque from 2000. Anyway, my bun was soggy wet and fell apart on me immediately. I mushed it together to glue it to the sausage a little.As we finished up our meal, we saw old Galaga and Ms Pac-Man video game consoles, with worn-out artwork and burned-in screens.

I would've played Galaga to show my son the classic game, but I guess not.Anyway, if I can give a Strike 4, it cost us almost $10 for a plain hot dog, Polish, fries and onion rings.

The rest of the non-stars go to the sales staff who are in charge of \"persuading\" you to take advantage of the eye club. Coming out of the exam room, the doctor told me about the the eye club, to which I thanked her for letting me know about it. She wasn't pushy, just informative, which I can appreciate. Then she asked me to sit back down in the waiting area, so I waited, After looking around and seeing an empty room for a bit, I saw one of the sales lady talking to the front desk lady. It didn't seem like any one knew I was waiting. So I walked up to the two, and the sales lady was like \"oh I was just coming to get you\"... so she takes me to her desk and explains the eye club, to which I listened, and then I said I would like just to pay for the exam and also wanted to know the prices of the contacts. She continues to tell me the benefits of the stupendous eye club, to which I listened once more and respectfully told her \"just the price of the exam and maybe some contacts.\" \u00a0She seems totally thrown off by this - almost offended. She snarks \"So you are going to come back next year and pay ANOTHER 79?\" In my head I thought - at this point I will not be coming back at all. \u00a0I asked her about the price of contacts, to which she brought up the eye club and how I would get this amazing 10% discount. Then the neighboring sales lady chimes in, \"Really??? You aren't joining the eye club? If there was an Eye club mafia, this was it,. At this point, my friend who was only a few feet away in the waiting area who heard and saw everything, sent me the funniest text about the situation, \u00a0without looking at him, I smiled, and I saw the sales lady dart her eyes over at him. Yes, lady, this is getting hilarious. Stop pretending like you aren't the lens-nazi. Then I went back to the contact prices - she went over the discount once again, as though she did not hear me say I was not interested several times already. I told her to just ring me up for the exam and I would get the contacts elsewhere. The other sales lady, asked where am I going to get my contacts then - as if it is any of her business - I told her I didn't know the name of the place off the top of my head, and she goes on about other places and their prices also going up, letting me know that the prices are the same, I sighed and just waited to be rung up. Finally, I got my receipt and prescription and walked out of there for good. When I got home I bought my contacts online, no eye club needed and they were cheaper - and the best thing of all?

They didn't even get my \"file\" out and give it to the other employees. 2 people walked in after I did and they were taken before me. Their appointments were also after mine.

The poof on top of my head was a little lopsided so I had to go home and fix it, but the rest of it was great. She took her time and paid attention to details.Makeup: This is the worst of it. When I made the appointment I was told they use MAC makeup. The day of my appointment I was taken into a bathroom in the back and was told the MAC was with another artist for a wedding. So for me she used Revlon, Cover Girl, and a bunch of other drugstore brands. I know a lot about makeup and I know a smokey eye is supposed to smoke out from the lash line. I basically got a ton of dark shadow up on my brow bone and a bare eyelid. To top it off, she used false lashes without asking and charged me $15 for them, on top of the $50 for the \"makeup\" job.

I was able to get a next day appointment. When I arrived, the salon was completely empty, except for the receptionist and the aesthetician, who were both playing on their phones. The receptionist was actually trying to greet me and give me the paperwork to fill out while carrying on a personal call. I was surprised by how the aesthetician was dressed. In my experience, they usually wear an all black outfit or something very plain and unassuming. The aesthetician at 5th Avenue was dressed in jeans, a holiday sweater and gym shoes. I thought that was a little bit unprofessional. When I arrived at the treatment room, I was told to change into a robe and put on a headband. Pretty standard, however the robe and the headband provided to me clearly have not been washed. There were foundation stains on both of them, neither was perfectly white, and I have to be honest, I was pretty grossed out. The bed only had a thin sheet to cover with. The facial itself was worse than the average. I used to get them regularly due to problematic skin in my teens and 20's, so I have lots to compare to. \u00a0Few extractions, maybe 2-3 minutes worth.

Located next to the Rolling Stones, it was easy to find and easy to park (free). It had been such a stressful month that I needed something, ANYTHING that would help me relax. I woke up, looked through Groupon and called 5 different spas for full body massages but had no luck. Nothing for today.Then, I went on to local \"beauty & spa\" section and found this salon. Immediately I felt relief because \u00a0I was able to find a Groupon that offered a facial near our apartment, and when I called, the receptionist was able to set up an appointment with the only aesthetician that accepts Groupon; Gina. It wasn't until couple of hours later, but I could try to relax until then, so I did.Back to the beginning, when I walked it, it was a hair salon, spacious, full of older ladies pampering themselves (older as in, they could be my grandmother's age or older. Full gray hair grandmas dyeing their hairs to look 15 years younger?) In any case, I didn't mind since I don't know much about facials. It was my first facial and as long as I felt relaxed and moisturized by the end of the appointment, it would be good. I walked in 20 minutes earlier than our scheduled appointment. The moment I walked in, I was greeted right away by the receptionist, who was older. She asked me to fill out two different forms. The first, very basic contact information to keep me in their directory asking basic questions including birthday and anniversary date. The second form asked more than 20 questions related to my daily habits. Anywhere from supplements that I take to the question that they always ask: are you pregnant?That form took about 3 minutes to fill. It was easy since it only required yes/no answers that needed to be checked off.Now, Gina comes out to greet me right away and patiently waits while I finish the questionnaire. She wears a uniform (soft yellow scrubs?) and takes me to a small room. She makes sure that I am comfortable. Reads over the questionnaire and continues to ensure that I am feeling comfortable at all times. She introduces herself as a trained aesthetician by Dermalogica and asks more questions about my daily ritual from cleansing to exfoliating to moisturizing. All really good questions because I have very troubling dry skin. My mother always said I had a normal asian skin. No. I have extremely dry skin. I know better mother!I tell Gina that I have had troubles with all the brands that I have used so far. Korean and Japanese high end products, Aveda, Dermadoctor and now Bliss. I need LOTS of moisturizing. My skin eats everything! She was so good at listening and answering ALL the questions that I had. So many of them too! She was very knowledgeable with the brand that she represented and she understood my skin better than my own mother. She gave me the attention that my skin needed. Cleansing, exfoliating, hydrating, cleansing, massaging, moisturizing from almost my scalp to my chest. My shoulders and behind the neck and upper shoulders. The entire session lasted about 70 minutes. Each time she would leave the room (twice, for 5-7 min. each time), she made sure that all was well with me and that I wasn't feeling claustrophobic. The steam was amazing and the hot towels were even better. At the beginning I was jittery due to the 4 cups of coffee that I had during the morning at Delia's in Oak Park, but I was so calm and relaxed at the touch of her fingertips. She was gentle and great at informing me with every step that she took.She didn't talk much otherwise, which was a blessing. There was soft music in the background and since she asked me to keep my eyes closed at most of the times, I didn't have to count the ceiling panels as I would do at a doctor's office :pI definitely recommend Gina, especially if you are new with facials. Maybe I didn't know better since it was my first time, but I am super satisfied. I will definitely return, especially since she gave me a $20 off coupon for the next time I make an appointment with her. Although she made it clear multiple times that I didn't have to buy any products, \u00a0I did purchase some of the products, and I loved how patient she was with all my questions. I was planning on dropping by Ulta after the facial anyways since I am running low on daytime moisturizers. I am going to give Dermalogica a try and pray that I have found THE moisturizer for me. Oh, and by the way, I checked the prices that they charged me for the products after I left the salon and compared them to Ulta. They did save me a couple of bucks and Gina gave me 5 packets of samples too! (at Ulta, they aren't too generous with samples....)Btw, Gina also does full body waxing too!

Also other stores charged additional for bustling of the dress, I feel the bustle should be included in the alteration price. So when I walked in to Jackie's Bridal I was greeted with a warm smile, and there was a difference in their stock of dresses. Jackie has Maggie Sottero and Midgley which is a brand I am in love with! The mother and daughter duo were so knowledgable and informative of wedding couture lines and brands , also they knew the industry like the back of their hands. Plus they have been in business for over 17 years, so I knew they are talented at what they do! Overall, I am in love with the store, their warm spirits, and their talented craftsmanship! Altogether my alterations are $350 which included taking in the free to up to 2 sizes and the bustling. Plus they are giving me 50% off any veil I like, and they have veils that are $200 and under, which is very reasonable!

They are selling a dress that will serve as the focus for a significant moment in the owner's life. They are selling a memory that the owner will take with her for all of her life. They are forgetting that they can contribute to that memory by being a positive highlight or a stressful disappointment. When buying my dress, I envisioned having a wonderful experience where I would take pictures, have a heartfelt memory, and starting a relationship with a salon that would last generations. I did not expect to be crying, alone, in a car, on my birthday after being yelled at for my dress not being ready on time. If you are looking to have an experience where you build memories- do not shop here. If you are looking to be treated like you are at McDonald's and still spend thousands of dollars- then shop at your own risk. I plan on notifying the designer house Maggie Sottero about my experience and the type of salon they have identified as being an authorized retailer.DETAILS: After reviewing the online reviews I was hesitant, but I followed the recommendation of my MOH. In calling to schedule my 1st appointment to pick a dress, whomever answered the phone was very curt and brief: name, what do you want, date, ok, hangs up. I called back because I wanted to confirm if I could bring 5 guests w/ me, because other salons had stated they needed approval for parties more than 4. Again the response was short: bring whomever you want just not your whole family, hangs up. I was nervous but I moved forward. At the salon I met with Julia, who is a delight. She helped my try on a dress I never would have and I found an amazing Maggie Sottero gown. I did not have my mother with me and she understood how personal of an experience this was for me and why I wanted to share it with my mom. I came back with my mother and purchased the gown.After the dress arrived I was told to schedule an appointment one month prior to the date of the wedding. I did so and explained I was nervous due to having a destination wedding, and I explained how important it was to have the dress on time. The assured me that the dress would be ready one week after the first fitting. I came in for my first fitting, measurements were taken and I scheduled a time to pick up the dress in 2 weeks. They said I would come in, try on the dress and then if I approved I would leave. On that day, I took off of work, spent over 3 hours driving to pick up my mother and bring her to the salon for the final reveal. When I arrived, the dress still had pins in it and the stitching was still taken out. They made up a lie and said: this is only your 2nd fitting and the dress will be ready in 1 week. I did not allow this to upset me because I still had time before my plane would leave. They offered to have the dress done in a few hours and I told them I did not want my wedding dress to be rushed, I wanted them to take their time and to do it right. We scheduled a time for me to return in a week (which is 5 days before my flight). I rescheduled my b-day plans and instead drove to the salon to pick up my dress, this time I had to do so without my mother. I came to the salon on my b-day and they said: did you not get my message on Saturday (this was Monday) we said the dress would not be ready until after 5PM. I was so upset. I was told:* It was my fault for coming because they left a message.* They were busy on Sat. because they had a wedding to go to and if they would have stayed to finish the dress they would have been late to the wedding they planed to attend.* The reason you are so upset is because you can't handle the stress of being a bride and aren't ready.* I am not going to bother talking to you when I could be sewing your dress* You can choose to wait for your dress or you can leave.A plus, Jackie did offer to complete the alterations and drop the dress off at my house. This couldn't work because my fianc\u00e9 would see the dress and if I needed more alterations or if it was not right I would have to go back to the salon again. \u00a0After having no choice but to wait my dress was ready about an hour and half later. I checked the sewing and it was half-hazard and not worth over $300. I was disappointed and when I pointed out that the dress was not falling well on my hips, the mother/seamstress told me that I needed to be better at watching what I eat. (I'm a 4)When I went to leave with my dress, Jackie pulled me aside to prove that she called. I tried to explain to her there still had not even been 1 business days' notice of a reschedule and she had already had an additional week to complete the alterations. Her mother/seamstress interrupted our conversation, and told me: why are you talking so much? You talk so much! In a couple years from now you will look back and wonder why you are talking.

I decided to go to my tailor who was sewing my bridesmaid dresses and she said she will charge me $100. When i got to her she zipped me up and noticed a big hole around the zipper!! The reason i didn't notice this hole the previous times is because they would also zip me up. I am so upset i paid $3000 for this dress and A. it was dirty and B. ripped!!

My future sister-in-law (the bride) were in the area looking at some of the other bridal shops, and we had some time to spare in between appointments, so we decided to give simply walking in a shot. Jackie greeted us as soon as we entered. We explained that we didn't have an appointment, but that didn't seem to bother her. To be honest, she didn't even give the slightest indication that it was any sort of problem at all. She pulled out two large books and allowed us to flip through them, marking the dresses we'd like to see. This was brilliant, as dresses look different on people as opposed to hanging on racks. The selection of dresses was beautiful. She had every style that a bride could want. My future sister-in-law was interested in the mermaid/trumpet styles, and there was a wide variety of them. All of them were gorgeous. Jackie pulled all of the dresses for us, and even went so far as to remove one from a mannequin. I know that's a hassle, but she did so gladly. Unlike our experience with other consultants, she was very patient, and HONEST. We appreciated it. She didn't put any pressure on us whatsoever. Not to buy, not to hurry with trying on the dresses. She would admit when something didn't look right, whereas other consultants would drop their jaws and say \"oh, it's beautiful!\" Her feedback was excellent, and something we defintely took into consideration while viewing the dresses--which, by the way, were lovely. She was constantly giving suggestions on how to accessorize the dresses, and took our reception of each dress openly. By the time we were halfway through the fitting, it seemed as though she knew exactly the kind of dress we were looking for. We ended up falling in love with the dress she'd pulled from the mannequin. And the price was amazing. We had been under the impression that the dress would sell for double of what the actual price was. A nice surprise.We didn't purchase the dress (yet), we're taking some time before making the decision. But we did make an appointment to revisit Jackie's to see the dress once more. It was our best experience out of six bridal boutiques. Jackie was kind, patient, and honest. She seemed more concerned with helping us find a dress, than making a sale. The selection of dresses was incredible and affordable at the same time. We have a feeling that we found the one! But even if for some reason we don't end up purchasing a dress here, we had a wonderful experience.

Fine, no problem, but don't doubt a bride's words. \u00a0All I needed to hear was, \"under these lights it may look white, but when you are out by the natural light you will see the ivory and we can compare it to a white dress!!!!\" \u00a0Don't go talking about me specially when I can HEAR YOU!!!! \u00a0Yes, the dress in ivory but it wasn't my first impression of the color!In the end, I decided to find my own seamstress for alterations because I left with a poor taste in my mouth. \u00a0I would definitely go here again to shop for dresses but really only because you get GREAT value, not so much the service.I do have to admit they are VERY responsive if you call them. \u00a0When they say they will call you back, they do!

The thing that was kind of crummy was the size of the dressing room and that I was left to try on the dresses myself - with only the help of the company I brought along. The fluorescent lighting wasn't so great either. But aside from the not-so-ideal environment, getting a dress for $700 was a major win. When I found my dress, Kay brought me to the main part of the store to stand in the broader mirrors, which was nice. We asked about the \"no photos\" policy but she encouraged us to do whatever we wanted and we had out about 3 cameras. She laughed about us getting her in trouble, but let us do our thing.

I went for a bridesmaid dress. Sample sizes are VERY limited (and small). the environment is dated and dirty. When I went to try on I was alone noone sought me out to help with the purchasing, zipping, seeing who might have already got this dress (the bride did same colors for all, different styles, no overlapping), or price. dress arrived 4 months later, I got a crumpled up dress in a plastic garbage bag (goes for brides and your $2000+ dress too, garment bag not free, extra $30). They did not and do not press dresses for you and instead hand it to you out of the box, letting you leave with a wrinkled dress-attendant even said it came in a box and they pulled it out and hung it (pressing is extra $25-$50 depending who you ask-shady) It was a disaster, bottom of this floor length $320 gown did not touch the floor. Not only did it not hit the floor (barefoot), it was on an angle upward where one part was lower than the other part by 2-3 inches.In comes manager Flo (blonde 80's style hair nasty woman). Flo's said this dress was uneven b/c my hips were uneven and one was higher than the other. Next she said \"you are wearing the dress wrong\" and came up and pulled it waay down. i said to her \"the fabric literally ends right above my nipple-is this right?\" she said \"yep that's how the girls wear it\" i was like \"no you dont get it its literally a half inch above my nipple and way under my armpit\" she said \"no thats how you have to wear it\"She then said the dresses are made for girls who are 5\"6 with a 2.5 inch heel. I told her I am 5\"6 with no heels and it isn't touching the floor. I asked if she stood behind her product/dresses, she said \"no, i didn't make this dress so i can't and won't take ownership for how it turned out\" then i asked her to at least acknowledge that it was uneven and way too short, she did. she had a bad attitude told me i can keep it as is or send it back and hope a new one comes in time but that it probably wont then shrugged her shoulders and left never to be seen againAfter 1 hour (2.5 hrs total), a seamstress gave me some options-she turned out to be incompetent too as the alterations she told me would take 2 weeks took 3.5 and when i was due back at 3pm on a monday she said she totally forgot and needed even more time.Gina came next who was also terrible. She is the woman who initially was there with my appt and who left me alone. she asked me why i didnt discuss adding length at the bottom during my consultation (my consultation with the MANAGER Flo). i told her because i am not a bridal consultant and am only 5\"6 so why would i need it? She told me i should have mentioned to my consultant i was going to be wearing heels to the wedding and because i didnt mention that this mistake happened-wait dont most bridesmaids wear heels? also the consultant said these dresses are made for a 5\"6 girl with a 2.5 inch heel soo here i am wondering why is it not hitting the floor if i am 5\"6 and barefoot.she said i should just return my heels to get flats. after THAT she asked how tall the guy i was pairedwith was. i said we're similar...she then said \"well you dont want to be taller than your date anyway! get rid of these heels, get some flats and then you wont look silly next to your date and your dress will hit the ground!\"she then took me to the computer to look at a pic of a model in the dress. i told her it looked right on the model but didn't change how bad my dress looked, she said \"well honey models posing for these kinds of things are made to look perfect and have perfect dresses\" and i said well mine should be perfect too. i also reminded her this model was probably much taller than 5\"6 and her dress draped beautifully onto the floor.they kept saying my short dress was an advantage because i won't trip or rip it etc. Noone could admit that it was wrong and looked terrible. noone offered me solace, a discount, or any kindness. my dress was over $300 and for that price i have a certain standard. I told something similar to Gina, I said \"you know, if i was at davids bridal and i spent $100 our conversation would be different, but it's not davids and this dress was over $300\"..her response: \"yes i know i suggest davids bridal to a lot of clients who come in because it is more affordable\". i asked for them to waive remaining balance and i could just leave, they refused.they also upsize you big time to make $$ in alterations (happened to our whole bridal party + bride)also: my aunt knows a seamstress and we asked if she could come in, Gina said she'd check, she came back and said \"oh I'm sorry, she left for the day\"...well ok no biggie except when we were exiting who do we see? the seamstress!

There were a few nice and pricier selections, but my jr. bridesmaid niece (age 9) was not impressed at all.

The bridal consultant was fine throughout the process. However, the other staff was rude, abrupt and uninviting with each visit. I expect more from a long-standing bridal salon especially when one is making a significant purchase. 4) Dress order - I was told that it would take five to six months for my dress. Which was very close to my wedding date. I was told (to apparently allay my fears) when it arrived, the alterations wouldn't be more than two days to do. They also ordered a different size than the one that was indicated from my fitting. They notified me after the fact, that a different size would be be ordered unless I signed off. I signed off. Five to six months later, guess which size arrived... The one I did NOT sign off on.5) Alternations - as with number 3, no or little help offered or given through the fitting process.

It could definitely use some new carpet and paint. However, prices are still on the high end. I was pressured into buying a sample dress that was on sale for about 2/3 or 1/2 the original price that day because they will not hold anything. They tell you that if you don't buy it on the spot, it could be gone the next day. The sample dress was an older, discontinued style that was still modern and fresh looking. The sales associate I worked with, Kay, actually seemed nice (but the cashier/associate in the reception area was very rude). I also read other reviews that they are nice to you until you buy a dress, or until they know you are not going to buy anything, and I found this to be true. Kay did tell us the policy was not to allow any photos, but my mom snuck some when Kay wasn't in the dressing room. I have heard that some sales associates at Eva's Bridals don't help you get in the dresses to try them on, but Kay was very helpful with this and clamped the dresses. I bought my dress there and they held it for several months so I wouldn't have to store it, which was nice. I wasn't sure I wanted to get it altered there because I couldn't find many reviews on actual alterations at the store, except there were plenty of reviews on bad customer experiences with dress shopping at Eva's Bridals. The dress was huge because it was a sample size (12) and I am a 4-6, so alterations were very important in getting the dress to look right. Ultimately, I appreciated that they have a sales room where you can look through dresses on your own and you can buy off the rack right away.

I come in on Monday, an hour early and with family in tow (All in from Texas), to be told that I can look at dresses but I can't try any of them on. WTF?!Apparently it was a commission issue. I told the person who approached me thanks but that I would be leaving. What's the point of just looking? I can do that from the comfort of home online.

My second consultant said that she would do her best to find comparable dresses. She was much more helpful. I give three stars because you can't take pictures. This is crazy. Brides need To be able to compare and visualize the dresses. I'm even sticking with two stars after a much nicer second visit because first impressions are everything, and they are awful upon meeting.

My size is a standard size in any plus size store and not a crazy high number either. I chose to go to Eva's because their website touts that they have a LOT of plus sized wedding dresses to try on. I called ahead to find out if this was true. I told them my exact size and what sort of dress I would like to be able to try on. I asked if they had more than 1 sample I'd be able to try on (clips or no clips). Person on the phone assured me up and down they had quite a few wedding dresses in my style and size I would be able to actually try on. I made an appointment for the weekend.Bad traffic on the way to the morning appointment. \u00a0Again, I hate to waste people's time so we called ahead to let them know we were sorry, we'd be about 10-15 minutes late but would definitely be in. \u00a0Woman on the phone said no problem, they had our appointment and it wasn't a problem.So we are just getting out of the car, walking to the front door of the store 12 minutes late and my phone rings. Woman on the phone says it's Eva's Bridal, we are late for our appointment--are we still coming in? They have a busy day and we are late and they really need to know if we are coming in.I said yes, we called 20 minutes ago and spoke to (name) \u00a0to let them know they we were running a few minutes behind and (name) said that would be fine.\"Well, she never told us. Are you coming in?\"\"Yes, I am literally walking into the store right now.\"Are you kidding me?So we were paired up with a fast-talking lady who would not let me get a word in edgewise. I told her I'd called ahead and was told there were a few gowns I could try on in my style and my size and wanted to start there. She said she'd pull a few dresses for us while we browsed some other bridesmaid dresses.Long story short--we were whisked away into a fitting room where sales lady pulled some dresses for me to try on. But, you see I could not try them on because NONE of them were in my size. Not a one. And I mean not even close where I could put it on and clip the back of them to get an idea. And again, I am a plus size but a very mid-range normal plus size.So, sales lady insisted I stand in front of the mirror and wanted me to just HOLD THE DRESS UP in front of me and \"just imagine what you'd look like in this dress.\"I asked if there was anything I WOULD be able to try on. She kept talking about how I could get cheaper alterations and if I was worried about the price of alterations I could just go to a local tailor and not get it done at the store. I just needed to imagine what I would look like in the dress.I had to stop her several times just to remind her it's not the price of alterations, I just wasn't excited to spend $2000-$3000 on a dress I can't actually try on and have to \"imagine\" will work out well. That's when sales lady huffed and puffed and grabbed the remaining dresses and just left the room and never came back. Seriously. Before, we could not get her out of the room for a private 2 minute discussion, then, but poof. Gone. Never came back to check on us.So, we left. With barely \"have a nice day\" from the people at the front desk. They asked no questions and barely acknowledged we were leaving. Sales lady was nowhere to be found.Heads up to Eva's: It's not the pepto interior or dingy dressing rooms keeping people away.

When I was dress shopping, the woman helping us was very friendly and listened to my feedback, so she picked me the perfect dress, which I bought. Also, the seamstress, Pat, was great. I wish I could have dealt with her exclusively.For these positives, I wish I could give at least 2.5 stars and not 2, but 3 is too high.I only ordered my dress 4 months out from the wedding, but they checked with the designer and said that was fine, it could be rushed and arrive mid-August. The dress didn't arrive until September, a week before my wedding. I would have been completely fine with that except Eva's did not do a good job of communicating the dress status at all. I called them in mid August and was told the dress would be there the next week...then the next day...then I was told that the tracking number said for sure by the next Monday....and so on. Total runaround. Three weeks later, Eva's emailed me to say there was a delay at the factory so the dress hadn't even shipped. So basically all the previous information about \"it will be here in two days\" was just fabricated to either appease me or get me off the phone. Either way, the communication was not transparent at all. Once my dress finally came (9 days out), I was told that there were no fitting appointments until 3-4 days later, even though I had literally begged them in advance to slot me some time, knowing that we were going to have a tight turnaround. I had to speak to two different people and really arm twist someone to be put on the fitting calendar the next day.I spoke with the manager or owner about this when I picked up my dress, and requested that my final balance (a nominal $34) be waived as a courtesy for all of this miscommunication and them not being forthcoming with information. They knocked off $10, which I found to be pretty insulting actually, and the woman insisted that no other discount could be given because the dress had arrived \"on time.\" (It was ready for final pick-up two days before my wedding, when I did not really have the time to drive to Eva's in rush hour traffic).I really want to like this place better but had to give an honest review. I could have bumped to at least a 3 if the manager I spoke with at final pick-up had been apologetic and waived the $34 balance as a gesture of good will and customer service - it was not a lot to ask.

Apparently, stylists charge different amounts.I feel like whoever owns the salon is big on creativity but needs to up their game on organization and customer service for some staff.

Let me explain myself.I came here with a Groupon. I got a large BBQ Bacon Pizza and a large Buffalo Chicken Pizza with medium sauce. I brought them over to my buddies house for the Bulls game. The pizza was how I expected it to be, delicious until my health conscious body realized what it was being stuff with. This occurred right about when I hit my third slice. These specialty kinds of pizzas just do not sit well with me. This applies to the ones I had at Bije's, as well as ones that I've had from California Pizza Kitchen and other similar places that make exotic pizzas. \u00a0I should have ordered a mushroom, sausage, and black olive pizza and am sure my taste buds would have been satisfied. However, i was hanging with a couple of friends and watching a Bulls game, so I figured these two pizzas would compliment the game and scene of things a little more than your typical pizza. Guys, Sports, Buffalo Wings....but pizza style :) As I have said, the first couple of slices were great. I actually liked the BBQ Bacon Pizza a lot more because the saltness of the bacon combined with the zest of the BBQ sauce really mixed well with the cheese. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was a bit bland and probably would have tasted better with the suicide sauce rather than the medium sauce. Then again, I am not sure how hot the suicide sauce ranks in at, if it were too hot, it might not be enjoyable. Regardless, I do not think one can go wrong with the BBQ Bacon Pizza.The reason why I debated heavily on writing this review was because I knew I had a bias going into tasting these two pizzas. I knew that at some point my stomach would remind me of my Dad's favorite quote, \"A man has got to know his limitations\" (Dirty Harry aka Clint Eastwood). For me, my limitations are a typical old fashion simple topping type of pizza, nothing extravagant. I realized that I had tossed my limitations out the window as I saw the grease of the cheese glisten off of the top of the pizza \u00a0and felt the lard of the bacon clogging my arteries. I should have known better, but I wanted to get something that the guys would appreciate and am always up for trying new things. Therefore, is it really fair that I express my opinion on this pizza? I don't know. I guess you, the reader, get to be the judge. I can tell you one thing though. If I was tossing back beers (even though I don't drink anymore), getting my buzz on, and looking forward to a heavy night of partying...these pizzas would have fit the mood and situation perfectly. This is good \"let's get completely wasted and chow down on some greasy food at the end of a long night\" pizza. Ya feel me? I hope so :)Now I finally get to mention the thing that I've been most looking forward to write about in my review. Carl Quilici. He's the owner and he's a hell of a guy. I walked in the door to pick up my pizza and was greeted by his wonderful personality. We got to talking for a few seconds. I hear a little history on how long his restaurant has been around and can tell he is really sincere about making people feel welcomed when they come into his place. He is also a very humble person who realizes the economy is ruff, but rather than complaining about matters, \u00a0he gives praise to the Lord for blessing him with enough business to remain open. God Bless guys like him who do not take things for granted and whom always remain thankful. Carl, if you are reading my review, I am sorry that I only gave your place 3 stars. However, while I do not live in the immediate area of your bar, I will definitely make it a point to visit you again one day and to suggest your pizza to all of my friends who live in the surrounding area. I have some really diehard Karaoke buddies too and will definitely bring up the fact that your place is the place to be on Thursday nights. In the meantime, I wish you all the best brother and hope that anyone else reading this review has the pleasure of meeting you and tasting your delicious pizzas.

When you get to the end of this, you'll know why.Hidden away on a corner in a neighborhood dominated by condos and a pizza place very 60 yards is Bije's, a cozy sports bar with an amazing secret life as one of the best pizza joints in Chicago.The old moose head plays host to Carl and company's mecca for sports viewers. Bije's is a shrine to hockey. What most but a few insiders knew was that this family comes from Chicago pizza royalty, and they've blessed the neighborhood by keepin' it real... and here. Without the high-priced bullshit associated with Gold Coast sports joints, here's a REAL bar with real fans and a place that will host hordes of families and Cub scouts at any given time. \u00a0I will reveal that I brought one of the honchos from HBO Sports here one night while working on a Cubs documentary; we bellied up to the bar and he was, \"Man, I LOVE this place!\" \u00a0You can, indeed ,find magic times when the place is between crowds; if it were deeper in the trendier parts of Chicago, the lines would never stop.Yes, they do karaoke, but never have and never will, but the old TVs were replaced around 2010 to big, thin screens and a whopper of a full-walled projection system that, after years, still makes for a great night of watching and eating. The crew has enough ovens to keep it busy, and other items on the menu are just as good. Don't limit yourself to just the pizza, but for a first-time visitor, you HAVE to do Bije's 'zza. Outside of a local parish, you'd be hard-pressed to hear God's name invoked so often. The 'zza itself uses yellow corn meal for that extra crunch, and we just can't place what heroin is in that cheese and sauce, but trying to stop eating takes self-control. This and a pitcher of Miller Lite and we're totally happy. And pizza so good that it still has much of the mystique still there the next day, but really, hot from the oven is nearly religious experience. Crisp edges, and a center that weighs in under REAL cheese, so expect some softness there, but lined with crispy corn meal, it is like dining on a 2nd style pizza. nobody, ever, among our friends has said anything short of big love for Bije's. Friendly (unless, of course, you come in with attitude and/or block one of the limited parking spaces). If you must drive, park across the street at the bank. Tip generously; the girls here hustle with love and a smile. If you find yourself waiting, be cool. it's part of the deal: Demand can be insane some nights. No kidding; this is the best you could ever ask for in any city... and I have it walking distance from the house; Life is good. Above all, when WE walk in and you're in our booth, f***ing move.

The original location was located on Addison, just west of Clark. It's now part of the McDonald's parking lot. What amazes me most about Franksville is that the food tastes exactly the same as it did when I was a kid. It takes me back to the day's when my father and I would bring home a sack of Hot dogs for the family after another miserable Cubs loss. And if I was especially good and didn't yell any obscenities at Bobby Murcer after he struck out with the Bases loaded, he would let me splurge and get Cheese Fries. I know that I'm not a kid anymore, I'm just a middle aged, chubby man with a bad case of Acid Reflux, but it feels good to remember those care free days again. The day's where nothing else mattered except Bill Buckner's Batting Average. The Hot dog and Cheese fries took me back to those days, if only for a little while. The bottom line is this.

I've taken over a dozen guitars there for re-setting, re-stringing or re-habbing. A recent doubleneck purchase was given 4 new pickups at the recommendation of the staff, and they sound fantastic. A bass repair required an innovative fabrication that solved a serious problem without damaging the vintage quality of the instrument. When I was considering replacing pickups for a treasured old G&L, the staff actually recommended AGAINST it, noting that the pickups were hot, unique, and on the margin, new pickups wouldn't sound as good as the originals.

So, a referral from a musician/music instructor carries lots of credibility in my book.Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Drew and the rest of the staff worked as a team made up of friends - the opposite of what you might expect at a big container store made up of text crazy strangers with very different lives. In contrast, this place was made up of a \"critical mass\" of musicians, where all of the computers were Mac's and most staff were dressed in tattoos and tripster jeans - which I thought was very individualistic and cool! I could feel the passion and harmony within this temple and, of course, couldn't help but admire all of their fine heirlooms. The guitar room was my focus which felt like a bank vault stocked with precious valuables with shiny lacquered bodies (guitars of course) and a place of worship simultaneously. Let me not forget a man, part of this congregation, I noticed sitting in the middle with his sunglasses on and playing Blues with his soul like a professional musician. Yes, this is a place where professional musicians spend their days off and music aficionados from abroad (i.e. Italy) show up out of the blue in awe. As a novice, my dad was a bass player in a band while I was growing up, and I remember all of the times he and his band members would gather around a fire and jam to Long Train Runnin' (Without Love) by the Doobie Brothers and songs by Santana along with a faint smell of oregano in the air lol.Be sure to ask for Drew!! I found a couple of guitars that he was kind enough to demonstrate the performance with one of his own songs. Wow! And, again, this was done because Drew has a passion for music and wanted to share that with my gf and I. Thanks Drew!! Oh, and Drew can play, play, play guitar well. His playing was inspirational as he passed me the model and I carefully placed my fingers to slowly strike a C chord lol. Well, gotta start somewhere so I might as well start at the beginning with a great sounding guitar with a great resource like CME to back me up in a time of need. Thanks Drew and CME!!

I took my 1976 Fender Quad here when I first moved to Chicago. The turnover was about two weeks, nothing crazy, but when I got it back, the thing ROARED. I'm not one to write a yelp review when I'm high on my own satisfaction, so I wait until I can be more pragmatic about the place.September 6th, I dropped off a '72 Electro Harmonix Small Stone just to have it true-bypassed and eliminate the volume drop. It took 2 months and eleven days, when I received it back on November 20th. Ridiculous. I hardly had contact and was really frustrated. Every time I called, I heard they were working on it, but that the year of the pedal was hard to do the simple mods I wanted. I get the pedal back to being the most MIND BLOWING pedal I've ever heard. It really is so unique and beautiful sounding. The quality was so fantastic that it outweighed even the ridiculous wait I had. I later found out that the pedal was very hard to mod due to the age and once I plugged it in, all was forgiven.

I felt right at home as he helped me choose my first guitar, a Taylor 114e, to use and reacquaint myself for my planned lessons at Chicago School of Music with Richard. By the way, it was my instructor Richard who recommended this place to me. So, a referral from a musician/music instructor carries lots of credibility in my book.Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Drew and the rest of the staff worked as a team made up of friends - the opposite of what you might expect at a big container store made up of text crazy strangers with very different lives. In contrast, this place was made up of a \"critical mass\" of musicians, where all of the computers were Mac's and most staff were dressed in tattoos and tripster jeans - which I thought was very individualistic and cool! I could feel the passion and harmony within this temple and, of course, couldn't help but admire all of their fine heirlooms. The guitar room was my focus which felt like a bank vault stocked with precious valuables with shiny lacquered bodies (guitars of course) and a place of worship simultaneously. Let me not forget a man, part of this congregation, I noticed sitting in the middle with his sunglasses on and playing Blues with his soul like a professional musician. Yes, this is a place where professional musicians spend their days off and music aficionados from abroad (i.e. Italy) show up out of the blue in awe. As a novice, my dad was a bass player in a band while I was growing up, and I remember all of the times he and his band members would gather around a fire and jam to Long Train Runnin' (Without Love) by the Doobie Brothers and songs by Santana along with a faint smell of oregano in the air lol.Be sure to ask for Drew!! I found a couple of guitars that he was kind enough to demonstrate the performance with one of his own songs. Wow! And, again, this was done because Drew has a passion for music and wanted to share that with my gf and I. Thanks Drew!! Oh, and Drew can play, play, play guitar well. His playing was inspirational as he passed me the model and I carefully placed my fingers to slowly strike a C chord lol. Well, gotta start somewhere so I might as well start at the beginning with a great sounding guitar with a great resource like CME to back me up in a time of need. Thanks Drew and CME!!

Zero money was exchanged. I was very happy with the deal, I initially felt like I could be getting ripped off, but no one was making me do the deal. I could have said no, and again I tried to sell the items but they were just not selling. So I felt I got a good deal, because I wanted the item, and they made it happen.

Every time, I went to the Starbucks next door and two times I used that Starbucks bathroom without buying anything. Once I walked by at night (really deep in conversation about Neko Case for two people who never listened to Neko Case) and waved to the empty store. At this point I feel I transcended from \"customer\" to \"maybe worst customer ever\" and I'm here as a form of penance.May 2013, I turned into two windows before walking into the actual entrance. I'd sincerely like to know if anyone else has done this. It is a very big store. I was with a boy who let me join his band, which I found on craigslist, even though I had no experience playing bass or being in a band. I asked a guy where the basses were - at that point they were not in the \"bassment,\" a concept I found clever - and he brought us to a back room where, he explained, he was filming a music video though he seemed very confused about it. He handed me a thing & I didn't know what to do so I said \"maybe something much less expensive\" and he took back the thing & said something about how \"this one's made in Mexico\" which seemed super seedy to me but my friend nodded & I took the bass and said \"thanks\" & plugged it in but still lost so I stalled until he'd run through 12 iterations of \"can I help you with literally anything else\" and left & I played a self conscious version of \"Tiger Lamp,\" the only song I remembered for the band I was suddenly a part of. My friend played every Joy Division song he knew while the confused guy popped in habitually as if we were hospital patients, and I self-consciously felt like a hospital patient. He said I could have a black guitar or a sunburst guitar, and my friend said I wanted the sunburst, but I wanted the black one very badly and when they put it in a box, I carried it all the way home and this was a metaphor for our relationship. We walked for three hours trying to find the zoo and it started raining. We ended up kissing but that was the only time. I do not recommend kissing a bandmate, especially if it's just because you're confused about your feelings for your ex-boyfriend. That is not to say I don't condone following your heart, though. I condone following your heart.September 2013, I was dropping off my Orange Crush after it started making noises like it had a cold. The guy with the ponytail downstairs said he could not fix it because the individual parts were cheaply made in China. My mouth became dry until he continued, his back to me as he walked into the dark part of the repair room, \"so I'll just grab you a new one.\" And he said I'd wait upstairs, where a guy was playing the same Joy Division songs from May & I took a picture, and they carried the new amp to my mom's car, and Chloe said \"Caitlin did you know there is actual dirt on your back seat,\" and we listened to a mix CD from 2011 that had a Led Zeppelin song on it that Scott Cortez later made fun of in the dirty back seat.February 2014, the amp was having problems again. It is gray outside when the sun is even out and I'm sleeping only in three-hour intervals - I don't look forward to practice until I get there and I'm daunted by everything on the internet. I wanted to forget my Orange Crush, buying something else on craigslist, but I thought maybe I would just take the dead amp carcass back to the practice space to deteriorate. The ponytail guy was working and said, Caitlin, right? With the Orange Crush. This happened a lot. Caitlin, right? I talked to you on the phone. Caitlin, right? I'm the sales manager. I feel this was bad news and I was probably being talked about snidely. Ponytail guy said he'd get Alex, and a guy near the dark part of the repair room started playing a Mark Kozelek-ish song & making forceful eye contact with me while another guy off to the side shifted his glances between the two of us. I watched upstairs as Alex & other employees, including several managers, including a guy in a deep V who repeatedly asked me if I was okay, seemed to orbit in an augmented pace around the store looking for my amp. \"I can just come back...\" But the manager gave me this look like he was about to cry and said he would \"hate for that to happen,\" in a way that seemed non-negotiable. Just wait 5 minutes, just give me 5 minutes, here's what we're gonna do, he told me. We're gonna give you the 50 watt, it's about the same speaker size... is that okay with you? And we're going to get you a nice t-shirt for your troubles. I plugged a Mustang into the (much larger and much nicer) Orange Crush in the bassment as my hands shook fiercely like the day after I bought my own Mustang when I learned all about following your heart and rounded out all nine of those months by playing \"Tiger Lamp\" as confidently as I had ever done a thing in my life.

But, since we needed some firewood, I decided to buy it and took the word of the guy working there that it was seasoned. We got it home and the wood just wouldn't burn. We gave it another try with a couple of pieces of birch and a stick of hardwood. Still the same thing. The wood smokes more than it is consumed by fire. I called Meinke and spoke to someone who said that I was the first complaint they had about it, but offered to take it back, which I appreciated. They said they seasoned the wood outside for about 2 months (which really is not long enough, even with the dry hot summer we had). There should be a fire in the fireplace, not smoldering logs. I then saw the difference when at my brother-in-law's house where he had purchased twice as much of the same mix of wood for half as much as I paid for a 1/4 face cord and the firewood he received was kiln dried! This stuff went up in flames, not up in smoke. I would spend less money driving about 40 minutes away to get more firewood that has been dried out in a kiln.

In the 6 years we lived nearby, my wife and I ate here only once. I thought it was worth a revisit.This is your Italian-run fast food place. The smell of Italian beef aroma hits you just as you walk in as classic rock radio is playing \"Mrs. Robinson.\" Despite the temptation of the beef, I opted for a Maxwell Polish instead. My kids each had a hot dog. I deduct a star since grilled cheese was not on the menu, which surprised me.Looking around, the place is very clean, with black and white tiles on the walls. Seems that for every 2 Vienna Beef signs, there's a \"No Public Restrooms\" sign adorning the walls and counter. They also have a big Grand Ave. & May St. sign behing the counter, perhaps as a reminder of their origin. The seating consists of a counter all around the restaurant and diner-style stools that my Stunt Baby had difficulty scaling since they spun around. There were also plenty of picnic benches with umbrellas set up for eating outside. Since it was almost 90 out there, I think everyone chose to stay in the cool interior.Every order came with fries, not any old fries, but the fresh-cut potato fries. It amazed me to see both my kids clear them out completely. Very fresh and tasty. And yes, they have the forbidden k-word in a Chicago hot dog place - ketchup. They keep it behind the counter in a big quart-sized squeeze bottle. Use it discreetly for the kids and give it right back so you don't get caught displaying contraband.I deduct another star since my Polish was not flame-grilled, but had the rubbery quality of a hot dog. I need some charred edges to call it a true Maxwell Polish.Finally, after dinner, my five year old wanted an ice cream cone. Seeing that the cones are all huge, I asked for a kids size but they had none. The woman at the counter came up with a creative solution. Instead of a single big cone, she filled 2 cones with a sensible amount of ice cream in each, all for the same price of a single big one. This way, both my kids got ice cream and I paid for only 1 cone.In all, not bad. I saw a number of locals walk down the block to pick up orders for carry-out, some of whom were greeted as old customers by the crew. Of course, my older son liked his hot dog, fries and cone so much he told me to give it 5 stars, but then I reminded him of our favorite place and he changed his mind.

The hot dog was well cooked to perfection, it appeared to be a skinless dog by Vienna Beef, no complaints with the hot dog itself. There was not a lot of relish on my hot dog, but there was plenty (excessive) of mustard, the tomato slice and pickle slices were far larger than I would have preferred. The onions were diced nicely and were applied consistently over the hot dog so that there were onions in every bite. My hot dog didn't appear to be include celery salt, and I had to specifically ask for sport peppers. The sport peppers included were nice, not too hot and complimented the dog very nicely. The fresh cut fries were pretty decent, they weren't too salty or too greasy, they weren't particularly flavorful either. Overall this is an average place to find a Chicago style hot dog. Outside of the non-poppy seed bun all of the ingredients are fine, though the balance of condiments is a bit off. Simply put the mustard and pickle flavor overpowered a lot of the other components of the hot dog.

The doctor put him on a slew of medications for infection, stomach discomfort and stomach spasms. He would have intense stomach pain an hour after he would eat anything and it would last anywhere from half an hour to a few hours every time. We changed his diet- nothing helped with the pain. The real lifesaver for him was the bentyl the doctor prescribed for the stomach spasms that reduced the pain. It took him about 6 weeks to completely recover and he can now finally eat without pain again. So in a nutshell- never again.

We ordered both the Italian sub, which was mentioned in several reviews, and the Italian beef.... I couldn't believe it. While eating at the counter, I was starting to think we went to the wrong Bari. The Italian Sub--meat to lettuce proportion was unfair, couldn't even taste the meat, there was so much lettuce. The bread was stale, tasteless and crumbling, which was a shame because there are Italian bakeries next door and across the street. The Italian Beef-- Bland. Nothing was going on. I didn't taste the flavors, seasoning and meat juices that make Italian beefs so amazing. We were so unhappy when we left, with nothing to speak of on our palates. We think we might've gone on an off day since we're a minority in the reviews. We will try it again on another day and definitely take some sausages home from the meat counter.

Great sandwiches can be delicate, gut-busting, humble or flashy. What they have in common is that they're built with love and care and great quality ingredients. This is exactly what Bari's Deli has created for several decades. If you landed here, it means you are searching for a fantastic sub sandwich in Chicago. Yeah, yeah, bada-bing bada-boom-boom, you found it so look no further, because this joint is number one when it comes to subs. We love the made-to-order deli sandwiches. Picking just one of their masterpieces at this deli shop is no easy task, since every massive mound of bread, meat, and cheese here is nothing short of a Chicago treasure. Years ago, I tried the prosciutto, sopressata comprised of fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers and olive oil -- simply memorable -- fresh, chewy bread melds perfectly with the cold cuts and cheese. The savory olive spread adds an extra kick to the whole she-bang. We were astounded by the carniv-orgasmic offerings at this place when we first \u00a0came here over 10 years ago!You can try ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, mortadella with American, Swiss or provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, mustard, mayo, oil and vinegar, all packed on a fresh, fluffy Italian bread. The bread is simply ethereal. There are lots of solid options to choose from at this joint, which prides itself on creating sandwiches to satisfy every palette. Thick Italian bread envelops plump pieces of their meatballs, all elegantly smothered in delectable fresh mozzarella, Romano cheese and piping hot tomato sauce. Afterward, you can nap for weeks, awake refreshed (and five pounds heavier). My favorite sandwich here is their Italian sub (or Italian hero). If you want to have the gastronomical experience of a sub sandwich life time hit this place up for lunch.There is only one thing you need to know about this joint. What dat? What dat? The Italian sub is the one you want. Don't think twice! Just order it and step back. Let the man work his magic, while you marvel at the quick dance of sandwich seduction happening before your eyes. First, a long loaf of Italian bread is sliced open and fresh cured meat after cured meat thinly shaved goes directly into the sandwich. At this point, your mouth is watering as cheeses, peppers, dressing, everything, added so deftly that if you blink you might miss a step. Second, hold your wrapped sandwich tightly in your hands and try not to quiver with excitement at first bite!This mom and pop operation has been serving fantastic Italian sausage, Sub sandwiches and Italian beef for decades. I wouldn't say they have \"the best\" Italian beef in the city, but it is definitely worth trying (even if it is only once). This is carry-out only, so get your sandwich and get the hell out. \u00a0Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom.

It was served up on a wheat roll with a gigantic pile of tender, juicy, thin sliced Italian beef. BTW, you have to be sure to request the giardiniera when ordering.

The place is well-organized and quick to navigate, for easy locating of bands and genres. There's a separate DVD section with videos you will find nowhere else.

We started with the pretzel and with cheese drizzled all over the top of it, I can easily say it's one of the best I've had.

The place was completely packed - from the bar two deep all around to every table. It had been over 25 years since I last ate here and the place is exactly the same. They had an entertaining live band but the packed restaurant and the music made conversation a little difficult.Service was very bad because of the crowd and our server seemed to have way too many tables. He did get better as the night went on and I don't blame him at all. The tables are packed so close together that it was hard for him to get around. The beer selection on tap is very good and I spent the night enjoying half-liters of Bitburger Pils in the proper stem glass. They were cold, fresh and excellent.The food was another story and I hope it was because of the crowd but we were not impressed. We started with an order of hackepeter (steak tartare) which was fresh but not seasoned very much. This dish varies by region so I'm not knocking it because the portion was generous. Also tried an order of the potato pancakes which were small but good.For entrees we had the weiner schnitzel, rouladen and sauerbraten. None of are entrees were all that good - either too tough, too salty or too bland.

Oh, did I offend you (customer who shall remain nameless) by sharing my opinion? Sorry, let me rephrase. This is the WORST coffee I have had in my ENTIRE life, which includes diner, gas station, fast food, and instant coffee (or any underperforming brew we drink out of necessity). These are gourmet by comparison to J Bean coffee. I can't in good conscience defend a product of such low quality that mediocrity is the best thing that could happen to it.A year ago my boyfriend and I were here for an emissions test and being the junkies that we are, decided to give J Bean a try. It was a weekday, the crowd was thin and the energy was low. The woman who took our order wasn't exactly a walking ray of sunshine, but that's not the point. I ordered a latte and my boyfriend got the raspberry iced mocha latte, which was actually on the menu; he was not trying to be obnoxious. The mocha latte was cloyingly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). It tasted like half of it was raspberry syrup. Completely undrinkable unless you wanted a migraine and a stomachache. The latte was no better. We go to coffee shops in the city at least three times a week. I know what a latte is supposed to taste like, and this was a far cry. It was watered down, lukewarm, and what faint hint of coffee was there, tasted stale. No richness of espresso or creaminess of steamed milk, just flat with a chalky aftertaste. Maybe I've been spoiled by Jackalope, Wormhole, and Metropolis. I try not to be a coffee snob, but if you want your coffee to taste like coffee, and not tepid diabetes in a cup, you probably won't like it here. I honestly think the barista was new or just made the wrong drinks... I'm from one of those generations that never throws food away, and we tossed both as soon as we left.On another note, while waiting I saw whole beans for sale, stamped with roast dates that were 3, 4, 5+ months old. I've never advertised myself as a coffee storage expert, but the person \u00a0who messaged me seemed to think it was imperative to educate me on the magic of valve-sealed technology and how it extends shelf life up to a year.

When I walked into J Bean Cafe in the north west side of the city I had no intention of writing a review. I wanted to grab a quick sandwich and figured it would probably be below average due to the location and aesthetic, but I truly didn't mind because I was waiting for a store in the mall to open up. \u00a0My sandwich was ready in roughly 5 minutes and got plopped down on the counter by a lady who was clearly the cook, wearing no gloves and no hair wrap at all - I mean her hair was down and all over the place it was quite disturbing. \u00a0I pretended like I didn't realize her lack of sanitation and quickly hurried back to my table. First off, I asked for bacon, egg and cheese. When I got to my table I saw that they had used turkey slices. I brought it to the cooks attention and she yelled \"NO NO NO THAT IS BACON - IT IS SPECIALTY BACON\". I literally laughed. Specialty bacon? this looks like Aldi brand turkey! LOL. Whatever, I was hungry and it was too early to argue, I thought to myself. I then lifted what kinda appeared to be a croissant (it was smooshed so badly the bread was literally unrecognizable) to examine the interior of the sandwich only to reveal a super curly piece of hair. Nice and calm I walked back up to register and told the lady. \"excuse me, there's actually a piece of your hair in the sandwich\" She looks at me...her face turns super red and takes the sandwich and starts grabbing the alleged \"bacon\" and wipes it with her hands and says \"THERES NO HAIR!! YOU SEE, NO HAIR HERE\" -- as she's wiping it down with her hands!! I was literally dying, this was both the funniest and most disgusting situations I had ever been in. \u00a0After sifting through my whole sandwich with her bare hands she then reassembles the sandwich and hands it back to me. I took it back to my table, I had been laughing so much I was almost entirely out of breath. \u00a0I had never been treated to poorly in my life, I could do nothing but laugh. \u00a0I decided to take another look at the sandwich before I walked out and of course..........I found ANOTHER hair. \u00a0This time I decided to take a pic to legitimize my review. \u00a0This lady was truly trying to convince me I was delusional and seeing mirage hairs. To be fair I was never going to come back even if this hadn't happened to me, but I strongly suggest not patronizing this business. It's sad, but very obvious the folks that own J Bean are not happy with their lives. =(", "rating": "1", "date": [2016, 1, 25]}, "55": {"description": "Very friendly Staff. ..

I walked in to find a very unhappy woman at the counter. She looked simply miserable and like there were 30,000 other places she would rather be. I later discovered she was one of the owners - what a great way to represent your business! Surely enough, her disgusting attitude mirrored the offerings of J Bean. I figured I'd go with something simple for my first time there, so I ordered an Italian Panini and Vanilla latte with an extra shot of espresso. Before I could even finish my order, the woman cut me off and said, \"The 'expresso' machine isn't working. What else do you want instead?\" It kind of caught me off guard, especially since the person before me ordered a latte and it seemed to be working just fine a minute ago. Anyway, I took a moment to decide and noticed her glaring at me. Honestly, I'm not sure what I did to deserve such a nasty look, but anyway I decided I'd just try a normal old coffee. Without a response she just turned around and started pouring the coffee into a cup. The coffee was barely warm, and tasted pretty gross. I'm not even a coffee snob either, trust me, I could drink coffee from pretty much anywhere and this was like... bad. It was clearly the bottom of the barrel, so I asked if I could please have a fresher cup, and she said it was just made. I didn't bother arguing. I decided to just wait for my panini. The panini, despite being toasted, was somehow soggy. HOW is that even possible? I reluctantly brought it back up to her and said, \"I think this panini is a little soggy, is that normal?\" and she literally laughed and said, \"It's not.\" Okay. Also I should mention that while I was in there I overheard one of their employees asking about getting paid, but couldn't hear their response. Curiosity got the best of me so I asked this young person about it (this is also when I found that the woman there was the owner), and they told me they're all paid cash under the table and they often withhold payment.****** Something very illegal is going on at J Bean, and everyone should know that and know how they treat their employees! *******I, for one, will not return to J Bean and urge others to do the same.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 8, 26]}, "26": {"description": "I always get the iced tuxedo.

As many coffee shops I have been to, they have a great ambiance set up. Its a busy little shop with a lot of places to sit. Not necessarily somewhere I would sit and do homework, but definitely a good place to come get a cup of decent coffee. Coffee:The coffee itself was ok at best, but was a little watered down tasting. I had a skim latte, and it definitely lacked that strong coffee kick I have come to expect from a good espresso. Food:They do have a wide selection of food which was definitely nice to see! I tried the Nutella croissant, and it was very good with my coffee. I just which the coffee was strong to get a good mix with the pastry. Staff:The staff was there, but nothing special. It felt the same as any corporate Starbucks, Caribou, or anything else. Nothing special in this area.

Oh, did I offend you (customer who shall remain nameless) by sharing my opinion? Sorry, let me rephrase. This is the WORST coffee I have had in my ENTIRE life, which includes diner, gas station, fast food, and instant coffee (or any underperforming brew we drink out of necessity). These are gourmet by comparison to J Bean coffee. I can't in good conscience defend a product of such low quality that mediocrity is the best thing that could happen to it.A year ago my boyfriend and I were here for an emissions test and being the junkies that we are, decided to give J Bean a try. It was a weekday, the crowd was thin and the energy was low. The woman who took our order wasn't exactly a walking ray of sunshine, but that's not the point. I ordered a latte and my boyfriend got the raspberry iced mocha latte, which was actually on the menu; he was not trying to be obnoxious. The mocha latte was cloyingly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). It tasted like half of it was raspberry syrup. Completely undrinkable unless you wanted a migraine and a stomachache. The latte was no better. We go to coffee shops in the city at least three times a week. I know what a latte is supposed to taste like, and this was a far cry. It was watered down, lukewarm, and what faint hint of coffee was there, tasted stale. No richness of espresso or creaminess of steamed milk, just flat with a chalky aftertaste. Maybe I've been spoiled by Jackalope, Wormhole, and Metropolis. I try not to be a coffee snob, but if you want your coffee to taste like coffee, and not tepid diabetes in a cup, you probably won't like it here. I honestly think the barista was new or just made the wrong drinks... I'm from one of those generations that never throws food away, and we tossed both as soon as we left.On another note, while waiting I saw whole beans for sale, stamped with roast dates that were 3, 4, 5+ months old. I've never advertised myself as a coffee storage expert, but the person \u00a0who messaged me seemed to think it was imperative to educate me on the magic of valve-sealed technology and how it extends shelf life up to a year.

Even an electrical box outside has a chipmunk painted on it!While I did not find an arch like I wanted, I did get a sturdy wood trellis for a clematis that has been spreading all the way up to the rooftop. It was not something I had not been planning to buy, but I didn't see one as solid and tall as the one at Knupper.I also got some petunias to put in baskets and planters. The mini petunias in orange, yellow and shades of pink and purple simply can't be found at the big box stores. Not only that, but the plants were in really good shape, rather than being merely \"survivors\" as it seems to happen at Home Depot stores.And I have to commend Knupper's for having a huge number of wagons and carts available to transport stuff. At too many garden centers I've visited, seems the carts and wagons are hidden away somewhere at the other end of the store, requiring a long walk. Here, they seem to be at every entrance, and even between sections of the store.Knupper is a bit pricier than Atrium, so I'd recommend checking one of the other stores along Rand before committing to something big like an arch, trellis or giant planter from here, but I can't say anything bad about them.While I liked Atrium the best, Knupper holds its own and I still would go back there for certain garden items in the future.", "rating": "4", "date": [2010, 5, 3]}, "0": {"description": "Diverse selection of plants that are well maintained.

The tortilla tasted like it had been sitting out for 10min and the steak was like a bad grilling experience. Fish Taco, I will guess that it was Snapper, but not sure since it was crumbled and over salted.

Just plain awful. The burrito suzio, tasted funky. I had it before, with my first order (the good one) and it was amazing. Best I'd ever had. Second time it was un edible after a quarter of the way through.The guacamole tastes like avocado with lime. There is no onion or cilantro in it, and very vary minimal tomato. I mean like 4 pieces in the whole container minimal. There serving of guacamole also keeps getting smaller. I ordered it three times, only because I will eat any guac regardless if it is just a plain pile of mashed avocado or not. The last time I received it, it was less than half the size of my first order. They also gave me 13 chips. Yes a large paper bag, with thirteen chips in it. This is supposed to be a large order of guacamole...so I take it a small order is one tablespoon with 5 chips right? It's not on the cheap side either. To top of the bad, my rice was extremely dry today. Possibly a one time thing since I have actually really enjoyed their rice in the past.What ever, it's not un-edible for the most part. There's just a lot of better choices out there for the same price or less. Aside from the guac...

If I remember correctly, there are a couple of little tables outside where you can eat what you've purchased there. \u00a0Unfortunately the day we went, Harlem Ave. had turned into the sun's anvil, and sitting out there, even without a cup of coffee, would be inviting the kind of heat stroke where your brain boils right out of your ears. \u00a0And then, the street is usually pretty busy, so the fumes are a little off-putting. \u00a0But it's still a nice grace note.This is yet another of the small, local, ethnic places that really ought to be cherished, not only for the quality and the great prices, but because we need more businesses like this. \u00a0Stop buying your baked goods at super markets! \u00a0Patronize local bakeries if you can find them.", "rating": "4", "date": [2010, 7, 6]}, "19": {"description": "So overall with my experience I would not return unless it was for the cookies everyone raves about, but I will narrate my experience so you can judge for yourself.It was great to realize that this place made tiramisu as I was looking forward to this for Thanksgiving Day so I price checked the cakes the week before and was told that I could order them on Monday, but it turned out that on Monday they were closed. So after deciding to order the cake from this place I was happy to hear on Tuesday that my order could be ready the next day because I wasn't told that they would be open on Thanksgiving and I assumed they would be closed. It was great that they made the order in 24 hrs, but then lets get to the day we got the order.I got there about an hour after they opened and I thought the place was nice. Small and cramped but in a nice way just like Weber's Bakery. I saw the cake and the cake looked beautiful it was absolutely precious. They put pilgrims on the cake from the same whipped cream. That is where I had a problem. When it came time to pay I thought it was a lower price and I never got the person's name on the phone when they gave me the prices, so no big deal because if the cake is great who cares. \u00a0Then I was a bit annoyed that they were going to be open Thursday, but I thought it was for the better because I would be running around doing other things anyway and how bad could the cake get in one day. They told me that it would be fine. For a small place I thought it was great that they had plenty of staff on hand when the store was empty.So Thursday comes around and to much anticipation I get a huge slice for me. The taste was absolutely bad. \u00a0I was so looking forward to eating this tiramisu from this great bakery and I was so shocked. I still can't get over how bad it was because there was actual whipped cream on the cake. To this day I had yet to try a tiramisu with whipped cream. Now I don't know if that is how they make their special order tiramisu's or not, but I really wish I had just overlooked this place and went with a place I had already known for good tiramisu. So if you are looking for tiramisu be cautious and if you love whipped cream this is great for you. I don't like whipped cream, but the whipped cream was good, but it just doesn't belong on this type of cake. I could hardly taste anything else.So while the cake looked beautiful the opposite was true of its taste. I was so embarrassed at dinner too, everyone had a funny look on their face when they took a bite. \u00a0Needless to say half of the cake was left over and went in the trash.The place gets two stars because the service was great and the cannolis are a 5 star item.", "rating": "2", "date": [2009, 12, 2]}, "1": {"description": "Saw that the Irving location was open. \u00a0I was hoping for a little more. \u00a0I am sure it will improve over time!", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 5, 10]}, "2": {"description": "If you're looking for great Italian pastry look no farther displace supplies Marianas food chain as well.

Yes, yes, yes. Some yelpers can be quite cruel online because it is so easy to type things. But will those yelpers ever actually take action by trying something different at the bakery or discussing why something tasting odd with the owner? No, they will not because moaning and groaning online is always easier. Paula, the owner who I met and is truly a considerate and wonderful person, is simply a baker at her finest who knows how to appreciate delicious food. She is willing to take action, online or not, to get everything done right. Now onto the food. First my friend and I started out with the Tres Leches cake. YUM is all I could mutter as I took the first bite. The amount of cream, cake, and milk was perfect harmony. We also had cappuccinos, which were right on spot. They aren't sugared up Starbucks drinks--this is real Italian coffee. They even sell the espresso at the bakery. I got a Sicilian focaccia because sweets always make me want something savory. It was a perfect combo of sauce, onions, and soft bread. My friend had eaten lunch beforehand, but I still convinced her to try the focaccia. She ended up eating half of it. That's how good it was. The prices were all a good deal. You can get a pound of unique cookies for less than $10 or a big, delicious coffee cake for $4. There are tons of pastries even some as low as $.89! I mean come on where can you get a good brownie for less than a buck? You just can't go wrong here. I ended up buying a box of cookies and three pastries. My mom loves tirami su' , so I bought her some from Palermo. Now she only wants tirami su' from there!This place sounded so tasty that I was willing to ride on the CTA for 50 minutes. So yes, I recommend this bakery. \u00a0Ask for Paula the owner, say that her customer Tasha convinced you to stop by.

And for the records, the mold is produce world's fault for not switching out their products.I stopped in over a year ago and bought some products but didn't make it back there until about a month ago because I can only make it over there on the weekends. I bought a certificate off of a deal site and was really excited that I was able to purchase multiples (I bought 2). When I arrived the bakery wasn't too busy considering it was Valentine's Day weekend and there were a few young kids working behind the counter. A gal and guy assisted me (I think he was in training but he had a lot more personality than the gal) and I noticed there was a different kind of focaccia bread out. I asked what it was and she told me \"artichoke\". I said \"ok, I'll take one of those and two of the regular\" and then I ordered some cannolis, a cute valentine cake for $3.50, and some tiramisu. I was giving some of the treats as gifts so they boxed stuff up separately but I don't think they were very happy to do so. When it was time to pay I pulled out my deal and handed it to the gal. She didn't know how to ring it in so stepped to the back and returned to ask me if I had ever been there before. Her tone was a bit rude so I was confused as to why they asked. I know most places would prefer new customers to be using online deals but since you could buy multiples and there weren't any provisions stating \"new customers only\" (which is impossible to enforce), I didn't really get why she asked it in such a tone.My total was a little over $30 (my deal was for $24) so I handed over the cash and left. When I got home, I was really disappointed to find that I was only given one of the regular focaccias and 2 of the artichoke ones, which turned out to be anchovy. I was bummed out but didn't have time to go back and fix my order. Luckily, the cannolis and tiramisu were great! The cannolis were chocolate and I thought it just meant they were made with a chocolate dough but these were regular shells dipped in chocolate. So delicious!

The hospitality at this location was very well...hospitable. Shannon my server was very spunky as she was energetic in assuring that I received top notch service. Alex the restaurant manager took the time to show me the redesigned smoker which was converted from the old brick house oven which was previously in the aforementioned Crazy Calabrese restaurant. The floor plan is much nicer with the new design as it opened up the scenery to allow full view of the two TV's housed on the back and side walls. It has a very family friendly atmosphere and the owner Lou was very gracious enough in introducing himself almost assuredly making it a point to meet and greet every customer that comes in ( Kudos to you Lou, Alex and the staff in taking the time to do that). I'm not giving this place a 5th star until I try the sampler which by my account will be very soon. I am pleasantly surprised by the level of service accompanying great food, it was quite a wonder that Lou the owner told me that they just recently opened quite quietly.

The restaurant is very serious when they say that everything is homemade...this includes the pasta made fresh each day next door (at Pasta Fresh) and every sauce and part of each dish. When I think of Italian food in the United States, I am used to heavy food that leaves you stuffed after the meal. When I lived in Italy, the food was lighter and left you feeling satisfied, never heavy. Such is the case with BarTucci. The food is satisfying and the portions are appropriate. We ordered a lot but did not feel like we overindulged.Our appetizers included the Polpo Ubriaco (drunken octopus). The flavor was complex and balanced, rare for a dish that uses red wine as a main ingredient of its preparation. There was no bitter aftertaste and the baby octopus was tender. The Polpettine di Melanzane was something out of the ordinary! The ground eggplant made into small balls resembled the consistency of small meatballs and were just as satisfying (without any meat). The outside was slightly crunchy while the inside was tender and not mushy at all. The delicate red marinara sauce was buoyant rather than heavy and tasted as fresh as if you had grown the tomatoes in the garden. The homemade Focacce (breads) is a must as an accompaniment to any appetizer. Like everything else, this is made in-house and its lightness is almost surreal. There were two choices that night (rosemary and cherry tomato) and we chose the cherry tomato. The cherry tomatoes were sweet and the outside crust was slightly crispy. The inside was very light, unlike most breads you would think go well with dinner. For our main course, we had the Brasciole alla Barese, an angus beef steak rolled with pancetta and served with homemade cavatelli, a tomato sauce, romano cheese and parsley. The meat is sort of made into a \"sausage\" with the pancetta on the outside and the soft beef on the inside. The flavor slightly smoky and everything melds together tastefully. \u00a0Our other entr\u00e9e was the Linguine Frutti di Mare. A typical restaurant uses a mixture of canned and fresh ingredients. Not only did BarTucci use 100% fresh ingredients, they used a lot of it. I'm not kidding when I say there were about 8-10 calamari pieces, 5 mussels, 5, shrimp, 5, manila clams, two squid, and a lot of cuddlefish. The portions at BarTucci are very appropriately sized but this dish was quite large. In every case, you get more food (and much better quality) that the prices they charge. I think that given that 100% of everything is homemade, the prices are cheap.For dessert, we had their two desserts they offered that evening. The first was a tiramisu. Most tiramisu I have either has too much cocoa or the cream is too heavy or there is way too much liquor in it. Balance...this is the consistent theme over at BarTucci. The liquor they use is actually spiced rum and no one flavor overwhelms another. You can actually taste the vanilla in the cream of the tiramisu. I am not usually a tiramisu fan. I am now after having it here. The last dessert was a panna cotta, one of my favorite desserts. It was good though I think that instead of having a caramelized/burnt sugar sauce, the sauce should be fruit based. The caramelized sugar has a tendency to overwhelm all other flavors. Panna cotta is delicate and needs to be complimented, not overwhelmed. That is the only thing I would change about the food I had but aside from that, I can see this place becoming VERY popular in the very near future. I can say with certainty that I will be a frequent diner here and let other know about this great experience.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 1, 19]}, "24": {"description": "I found BarTucci via Groupon and \u00a0have been here twice so far.

The parking is limited but easily accessible, even if the connected lot is full. There are great places all around to park for free. The manager greeted us immediately at the door and continued to make us feel like we'd known him for years. The hospitality and genuine kindness of the waiter and, really anyone we encountered, were beyond our expectations (which were very high, I might add). My group could feel that they honestly CARED about us and our evening. It was incredibly refreshing to experience.I don't even know where to start with the food. My description will not at all justify the astounding meal we had. Every single ingredient and element was so fresh you can taste it. The only way I can begin to explain the freshness that I tasted the moment I took my first bite of the bruschette, can only parallel the feeling of taking your first sip of water after running 4 miles in 80 degree weather. I ordered the rigatoni amatriciana as my entree, which was absolutely wonderful. Usually when I order a dish with pancetta somewhere, the spices overpower the entire meal, leaving it too spicy and in the end unenjoyable. There is nothing else to say other than this entree was perfectly constructed, from the ingredient ratio to the presentation. And still, I could tell the elements to the meal were 100% fresh. The manager continued to tell us about the pasta being fresh-made next door to the restaurant. Can you say WOW. At this point, I feel like I'm rambling about the insanely delicious food and service of this newly established restaurant. JUST KNOW, this is really one of those hidden gems in Chicago.

However, the outside patio is nothing to talk about. You're literally looking at a parking lot along with busy traffic on Harlem Avenue. Definitely not a scenic environment.Regarding the food, I ordered a margherita pizza that was split between two people, which was not sufficient. \u00a0Let's just say I ate again when I got home. \u00a0What I thought was going to come out as crisp, fresh and delicious came out the complete opposite. \u00a0 The sauce was insipid, the mozzarella cheese was barely there, and the crust was chewy and had a consistency of almost being raw. I was totally disappointed. \u00a0The other person in my party ordered the locale. I tried a piece of his and it too was underwhelming. \u00a0Honestly, both pizzas were extremely greasy to the point where it left a residue of oil and grease on my palate. \u00a0Also, the price point and quality do not align with each other. \u00a0For two pizzas a soft drink and one beer came out to over $40. \u00a0 I personally think it's a little too steep for dough, cheese and tomato sauce. Needless to say, I will not be going back. This is literally the second time I've taken advice from \"Check Please\" and was highly dissatisfied. \u00a0Guess I'll go by that old saying - fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. \u00a0In short, I give up on the search for good authentic Italian style pizza in Chicago. \u00a0I'll leave it for Italy and/or NYC.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 9, 25]}, "27": {"description": "I liked my pizza here, but my boyfriend's pizza not so much.

Since we had to head over there this weekend, it was a perfect time to try out this restaurant! It was pretty easy to get to, however the parking was MUCH smaller than what I had seen in pictures. It may be because I'm a suburban girl, use to giant parking lots :P When we entered, we were greeted at the door and promptly seated. Inside it was nice and cozy, and you could see all the pizzas coming out of the oven from our table! I knew I wanted a white pizza even before we started, so rather than just looking at the menu, I just asked the server what white pizza she would recommend :) Husband, kiddo and I started with the arancini , which had a great balance of the risotto, ground meat, peas, and a large chunk of cheese! They were delicious, served with a side of marinara sauce.Husband had the panzarotti, which starts with red sauce and cheese, and he added sausage. I didn't taste it (not a huge fan of red sauce....and frankly, my pizza kept me more than occupied!) but he couldn't stop raving about it. He even commented (and I would agree!) that this was pretty close, if not just as good as the pizza we had at Eataly!I did appreciate the kiddo menu, which was a basic pizza, but they shaped them into either Micky Mouse or Nimo. Kiddo had a Mickey Mouse cheese pizza, which came with sauce filled ears, and eyes made out of olives. Beware to those that are use to Americanized olives, these black olives are true from Italy, so they definitely don't taste like the out-of-the-can black olives (which was a disappointment to me, but that's ok!) The size of the pizza was great! Kiddo was definitely full, and we even had a few bites of her crust ;)I asked our awesome server for her recommendation of a white pizza. She said the most popular was the prosiutto and arugola pizza, but since I've had quite a few prosiutto and arugola pizzas, I opted for her second favorite which was the barese. This one had rampini (which was like a very flavorful broccili crossed with spinach), crumbly sausage, and burrata. I noticed that the burrata (imported from Italy) had a much saltier, and less cream flavor than burrata I've gotten from the grocery store. It definitely paired well with the rampini and sausage.It was such great food, and awesome service! The waitress we had was great, super nice and knowledgeable. Than the manager, George came up to our table to thank us for coming. He wondered what brought us in, and really took an interest in us as guests. I heard about this type of service from all the reviews, and they didn't disappoint.

If you don't know what that is, you might want to look it up before you go so your expectations are set appropriately. Some of the reviewers here seem to be disappointed by the crust that's a bit soggy in the middle but that's how it's supposed to be done. This isn't your father's (unless your father is from Naples) thin crust pizza. The owner once showed me how they eat it in Naples: you don't cut it but rather fold it up and eat it like a sandwich. I've never tried it this way, but he showed me it works.I've had about half of the savory pizzas from the menu as well as several of the daily specials. I have yet to be disappointed. Everything is very fresh and tastes that way since it's only in the very hot oven for about 90 seconds. Since my first visit I wind up getting cravings for this pizza every few weeks.I don't know how folks think the sauce and crust are flavorless because that's never been my experience. I think both the red and white pizzas are very well balanced in terms of seasoning and the crust I could eat all by itself.They have two beers on tap, both Italian (Peroni and Moretti) but have a small but decent selection of bottled and canned beers.

The location is a little tough to deal with as there is limited parking and it's on a busy section of Harlem Ave. Then again, what section of Harlem isn't busy?We were greeted promptly and seated near the window. I like that they have bottles of water at the table. We started with the calamari. The pieces were good-sized and fried very lightly, they came out more yellow than golden-brown. Also, they were well seasoned, you could taste the salt and pepper in the batter. The calamari still had a nice crispness and the marinara sauce they came with was perfect. Bits of fresh basil and garlic with the fresh tomatoes. I wish I had some crusty bread to finish that sauce off!We had two pizzas: the bufalina and the local. Both pizzas are about 12 inches are so. The bufalina was basically a margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella cheese. And the crust was done properly, not too thin, not too thick. While it still had a great flavor, it wasn't salty or oily, which a lot of crusts can be. The buffalo mozz had that sharp tang that gave that pizza a little extra punch. The tomato sauce was light and fresh, but still held its own. The only thing is I would have asked for some extra fresh basil, since I'm such a basil fan. But the ingredients were incredibly well proportioned, it was cooked well, and the taste was wonderful. The locale added a locally made crumbled sausage and organic mushrooms. The sausage was seasoned really well and the mushrooms were great quality too. It was awesome, esp with some grated cheese and black pepper.I had an Italian craft beer as well. They have about five or six to choose from. They're certainly not cheap, but it's nice to be able to purchase a beer that you're not likely to find anywhere else in Chicago. If you want to splurge, they even have a $16 IPA. The service was very nice, as our appetizer plates got taken away when we were done and the server helped us with pizza and drink recommendations. Also, George, one of the owners, came by and chatted with us for at least five minutes, if not longer.The prices aren't cheap, but the quality is on another level.

One of the things I enjoy most about my weekends is when my dad comes to visit from Wisconsin, we have brunch at the Red Apple, then go grocery shopping.Typically we go to Wally's (now Cermak Produce) for the majority of what we need, but for the few items we can't find we've gone to Szymanski's. Usually, we've never had a problem. \u00a0I've enjoyed their fresh baked goods, smoked fish and paszteciki time and time again. We stopped by there first for some fresh veal, smoked chicken, and other meats. While waiting in line, I took out my phone to take a photo of the sausages to post to Instagram and while I was doing so one of the cashiers pushed past me and yelled loudly that taking photos was not allowed in the store. I joined my dad and he read off his order from my mom's list. He asked if they had baked ham. The incredibly rude woman behind the deli said \"yeah.\" My dad asked for 1/2 a lb, to which she replied \"what kind?\" \"The baked kind,\" my dad responded. She walked away from him. Finally she came back and my dad (5'8, Pat Sajak look-alike with a mean streak) said \"you know what, no thank you.\" We put our baskets down in the middle of the aisle and walked out.

However with that kind of customer service, not only did we go to the competition, we'll be going there from now on and not stepping foot in an establishment like this again. Let me also say that Polish groceries are notorious for this type of treatment in Poland, and apparently it didn't change with stores here in America. The difference between Szymanski's and Cermak Produce is overwhelming; the girls at Cermak are smiling, joking, offering samples (of vodka even), being helpful and actually providing a service.

At Jimmy John's though, I can assure that will never be an issue.  Jimmy John's is a Subway like restaurant where you order and customize to your liking while moving down the line of foods and choices they offer. This place is always packed and appears to have only happy satisfied customers. There is usually plenty of seating even with the crowds rushing in to get their fix of fantastic sandwiches to sustain their sandwich meters. The service is fast also! It almost seems that before you are finished ordering they have completed your order and it is ready for pick up.  Out of all the choices there at Jimmy John's, it is quite the challenge attempting to pick my favorite. I think I am going to have to go with their turkey sub though. One of the key points that drives the whole experience to be so good is the oh-so-tasty bread on which sandwiches are made. I mean sandwiches are made on bread, aren't they? The bread is so divine I could almost eat it for a meal alone. Freshness is key in a situation such as this and it is definitely present in the bread used at Jimmy John's.

She completely my very technically difficult mani and made it look so effortless that I could almost find it unbelievable that most shops will refuse to do this mani for the simple inability of their techs- but I do believe it, because I've been turned down before for similar requests.Hanna is very talented and a gracious host to all her customers.

I have bought Groupons in the past for mani-pedis. They have done a comparable job to the local Asian shops, but without a Groupon they are a lot more money for the same services. \u00a0 I recently went in for extensions, I told my story of how I lost my hair through chemo, and was looking to get a few extensions to give myself some needed length in the front of my hair. They were helpful with the information, I decided to order the extensions and Vanessa suggested I do a Kerratin treatment to relax some of the curl in my hair. They gave me the Groupon price of $99 and I put down a deposit on the extensions of $75 and another $15 fro a brush they suggested. They said they were out of the 16 inch extensions that were on backorder, so she would order the 18 inch extensions since we'd be cutting them anyway. She said it would take about two weeks and she would call me when they were in. I got the Kerratin treatment, didn't wash for 48 hours, continuously flat ironed if it got out of place and when I washed my hair that Monday, 48 hours later, it was the same result that I had before the Kerratin treatment. I called the salon on Tuesday and left a message because I wasn't sure if this was the result I should have, I knew it wouldn't straighten completely, but I didn't expect any frizz which I had. No one returned my call. I called later in the week and again, no one returned my call. Two weeks had passed and I never got a call about the extensions, so I called on a Monday and left a message. Again, no one returned my call. I called the following Wednesday, and Vanessa answered and she said she didn't know what happened, that she would \u00a0talk to the owner and get back to me. (The owner is her mother, Lisa) She never returned my call. I then wanted a refund, I was over it and now didn't trust her to put then extensions in my hair and didn't want to give her the $225 she quoted me to do my hair, especially since the Kerratin didn't take well. I called again and I left a message with the receptionist to have the owner Lisa call me. I never received a call. This was so frustrating that I was starting to think that they took my money and didn't order any extensions. I felt like they were avoiding me. Finally after a month after my original visit, I went into the salon. I asked the receptionist if I could speak to the owner. I explained that I was in for a refund on extensions and suddenly Vanessa popped out of the \u00a0esthetician's room as if she just woke up. She told me she spoke with the owner and that she would give me a refund because the extensions were on backorder. I found this very strange because the day she ordered them, she said the 16inch were backordered so she would order the 18 inch and they would be there in two weeks. \u00a0She didn't even put the refund back on my credit card, she gave me cash back from the register and then offered to re-do my Kerratin that I declined.

Each dish came with a soup bowl of really delicious sauerkraut and the waitress plunked a platter of sliced bread dumplings in the middle of the table. I counted them; there were thirteen thick-slices of dumpling, looking like the equivalent of a loaf of bread. The only thing that I thought there could have been more of is gravy.As usual, we passed food around the table. Glinda's pork was really kind of fatty, but the flavor was fantastic. \u00a0My pork loin was kind of dry, but again the flavor was good, and I think it might have been less dry earlier in the day. The sausage and smoked butt were excellent, too. And I brought home one of those large styro leftover boxes filled almost to overflowing with my leftovers.The prices? $5 each for a large stein of Okocim, $11 each for the pork dishes and $12 for the country platter. Service was fast, friendly and attentive, and as we left, the owner asked how everything was an the rest of the guys said good-night to us.Why this place wasn't jammed is beyond me. \u00a0I grew up going to places like this; it reminds me of a restaurant called \"Pavelka's\" of which I have many fond memories.

The dresses they carry are quite different than what you normally would find at other Chicago bridal salons. By different i don't mean great, but they are not bad also! Laurel bridal is by no means a cheap place. Dresses that caught my eye were all priced over $2000. I was ready to pay that much or even more money in order to have a unique and stylish European wedding gown. First, I looked at the catalogs and i was very surprised that the front page of the some catalogs was either missing or designers' information was carefully covered with Laurel's Bridal flayers and business cards. When i asked the owner who makes the dress i liked, she just said it's European. Well, i went to try on some dresses and boy was i shocked! Those dresses just didn't feel like a designer European dresses. Trust me that I know what a well made designer gown should feel like. Needless to say that all tags and labels were removed from the dresses.The dresses i picked looked pretty, but they felt VERY VERY CHEAP! It was like something you get from the Chinatown; it looks pretty on a picture, but it's not the best quality item. I liked the style of some dresses, and i was hoping that Laurel bridal sells replicas of some well known brand. I went home dedicated to find out what was the name of that brand and where can i buy an authentic dress. After 2 days of searching the web i found out that the dresses that are sold at Laurel Bridal are NOT replicas and they in fact really come from Europe, but it's a little more complicated... Those dresses are not made in Italy, France or Spain like the owner claims (maybe some of them are, i can only speak for the styles i was interested in). The dresses they sell are made in Poland and Ukraine. I contacted Ukrshic which is a factory based in a small town in Ukraine and they told me that all their dresses cost under $500 (shipping to the US included). They were extremely nice, spoke fluent English and were even willing to make some changes to the dress i liked on their website (which can be viewed in English as well). They said that the dress would be ready in 4 weeks and i should allow another 2-4 weeks for delivery. I didn't end up ordering the dress from them because i wasn't impressed by the fabric quality. I ended up buying an incredible Enzoani gown from the suburban bridal shop for $2500. That gown makes me feel like a princess, you can't even compare it to the dresses sold at Laurel bridal. Personally, i have nothing against Russian, Polish, Ukrainian brands and I'm sure that there are many brides who like me would like their modern styles and affordable prices. I just feel it's very wrong to provide customers with inaccurate information and to build business on lies. It makes me very angry when businesses like Laurel Bridal treat their clients like they are fools. They greet you nicely when you come in and they even make you feel that you are best friends, but in reality all what they care about is a huge profit they make of you. In my opinion, every bride has a right to know how and where her wedding gown was made, especially if it costs more than 2 thousand dollars.", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 2, 21]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Dunning"], "latitude": 41.947238445282, "longitude": -87.8070238977671, "rating": "3.0", "times": {"Mon": [], "Thu": ["11:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sat": ["11:00 am", "6:00 pm"], "Wed": ["11:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Tue": ["11:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sun": ["12:00 pm", "4:00 pm"], "Fri": ["11:00 am", "7:00 pm"]}, "price": "$$", "categories": [["Bridal", "bridal"]], "address": ["3701 N Harlem Ave"], "attributes": {"Parking": "Street", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "By Appointment Only": "No", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes"}, "category": "Shopping", "number_of_reviews": "5"}, "lee-nails-chicago": {"comments": {"28": {"description": "Stopped in after going to the other location on Irving and Cicero.

There is always one special shirt lingering behind the counter. This review is based on the nice customer service and is the main reason for the 4 stars. We were picking up some donut holes to give to some friends who were in need of some TLC. We were also a little hungry and decided to try the egg white flatbread sandwich with turkey sausage and cheese for ourselves. I must say that I am so sorry we wasted money on this sandwich. This might be the worse tasting sandwich I have ever had in my life. \"Do not!\" and I repeat \"DO NOT!\" ever try this sandwich because it is not worth it! The sandwich tasted like it was 100% microwaved. In fact, the flat bread was hard in some parts and almost inedible. The cheese was melted beyond recognition and I could not even taste it. The turkey sausage is mixed into the egg white and you can not even tell its there. Its very flavorless. This sandwich is so wrong. I would give it 0 Stars and it should be removed from the menu and not considered food. I can not rate the donut holes because they were in a box and we did not get to sample them because we gave them away. But they looked good. This place has a big bonus because its drive thru is open 24 hours a day. That is a score. This is my old neighborhood and when I was a kid, I would have loved a donut at 1am. We had nothing open at that hour, so I'm a little jealous. So I would come back her for the friendly customer service but not for that terrible egg white flatbread.

Do not waste your time at Kasia's. Incredibly disorganized and rude service. I am posting my email to Kathy aka \"Kasia,\" the owner and pushy saleswoman at Kasia's, since it best describes our waste-of-time experience at Kasia's. As a side note, I still have NOT received any reply from Kasia's in regards to my message:\"I am writing to let you know of my extreme disappointment and dismay at the experience that my friend and I had at Kasia's. We had our first appointment at Kasia's with you in August and my friend (the bride) did not find the dress she was looking for. She asked whether it would be possible to have a dress custom-made by Kasia's and you told us that it was possible and that we would simply need to bring in the design and a sample of the lace and satin we wanted to use. You suggested that we go to Vogue Fabrics or Fishman's Fabrics to look for the lace and satin and then to come back with the design and the fabric. We did just that and made an appointment for yesterday at 6 PM. We were runningearly, so we called and asked if it was okay if we came in about a \u00a01/2 hour early- we were told that it was fine if we did so. We drove an hour to get to Kasia's and once we did, we found that you were still busy with another client. We felt as if you pawned us off on your mother while you took care of the other client. Your mother was obviously not very happy to be helping us and treated us in an incredibly condescending and rude manner. When we first arrived, you told us that the fabric was just not long enough, but you gave us no suggestions or other options; you just called over your mother and went over to the other client. Both of you made us feel as if we were at fault for not finding appropriate fabric and you gave us no suggestions in order to be able to have this dress made by you. Being that my friend and I have never had a custom dress made before, we were relying on your knowledge and experience to assist us in having it made. For example, I asked your mother approximately how much fabric we would need, as you had told us that once you had the fabric sample and design, you would be able to give us approximations on the price and fabric amounts. Unfortunately, your mother kept responding with a simple \"I don't know.\" She said that the amount of fabric needed is different for everyone depending on the measurements, even though the bride was standing right in front of her!!! We finally just left with not even an \"I'm sorry\" from you oryour mother.The whole experience took no longer than 15 minutes, but was a colossal waste of time and left a bad taste in our mouths. We did not come to Kasia's to be belittled or treated in the degrading manner in which both you and your mother treated us. On your webpage, you state that your boutique is \"dedicated to providing each and every one of its clients what every full service bridal salon should always offer...Excellent Customer Service, Timeliness, Superb Quality, and Value...\" none of which, we received. It was obvious that you were too busy to deal with us, but in that case, you should not have booked us for an appointment, getting my friend's hopes up that she would be able to have the dress of her dreams made by you. Not only was the customer service poor, but the whole appointment-making process was incredibly difficult and disorganized. To say the least, we will not be recommending Kasia's Bridal to anyone and we plan on sharing our experience with our friend and others on Yelp.\"", "rating": "1", "date": [2008, 10, 12]}, "23": {"description": "I would not recommend this place to anyone. First let me say my wedding day was dramatically push forward by my husbands deployment. I was frantically looking for a dress I had about 4 months. I went here because I wanted to see about having a smile dress made. The women explained that this was there busiest season, and they weren't sure if \u00a0they could help me. \u00a0I found a dress that was not exactly what I wanted, but it was 200. I asked how much it would be to have the dress shortened, the lady told me 250 on top of the cost of the dress. Then I asked how much it would be to have the dress I wanted mad she said 300 plus the cost of fabric. I said the I would rather have the dress I want made then she said she didn't know and would have to call me. I knew then this women was full of CRAP! She never called me. Thats okay because I went to Victoria's Bridal 3738 West Fullerton Avenue, Chicago, IL 60647-2331 (773) 772-0972 She took excellent care of me. I would recommend if you have a spanish speaking friend to come with you, just to make sure everything is clear. She made my dress for $120 plus the cost of fabric, it came out to 160 flat! the dress looked exactly like the dress in the pic and she had the dress done 3 weeks before my wedding! she does AMAZING WORK WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!forget this place it's a Joke!", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 1, 8]}, "47": {"description": "I'm sad to see that Kasia's doesn't have an overall better rating.

So use those arm muscles and starting lifting those heavy ass dresses around to find your perfect dress!I had been searching for my dress for a long time, I found it on a designers website and then in one bridal store that was outrageously priced. A lot of the stores didn't have it or if they did, it was pretty pricey.I called Kasia's and they didn't have it but could order it and gave me a super low price compared to everywhere else. Sold!I went in and the experience was great. Kasia and her mother were very nice and helpful. The dress came (and was perfect I might add! :0)) and they did the alterations for me at a discounted price because I bought the dress from them. I also got my bridesmaid's dresses and they all got a discount for ordering together. The ladies are fun and entertaining to be around, I don't understand others complaints. All in all, a wonderful experience! I think someone else said it best in their review, don't go bridezilla on people and you will always have a happier, nicer experience. No matter where you go. People don't like mean people and can only put up with so much. Surprise! :0) Another piece of wedding advice, RELAX. It's not the end of the world if a tiny detail goes haywire. Breath. Enjoy it, instead of stressing over it. That's what I did and I loved every minute of the planning and the day itself. Oh and don't let others freak you out!

Feel free to message me with any questions about this experience or others I had around Chicago.I had a great experience at Kasia's and finally pulled the trigger on a wedding gown. I can compare Kasia's to the following places where I had try-on appointments:1. David's Bridal2. Weddings 8263. Nordstrom4. Macy's5. Glamour Closet (walk-in)6. BhldnAs you can see, I got around town in a short amount of time, June-August 2014. By the time I made it to Kasia's I was exhausted, but had an idea of what would look good on me and what was attainable for my $1,000 budget. I'd called ahead looking for a certain Mori Lee dress which they had in stock. Making an appointment was easy, I called about 3 days ahead-almost all of the stores mentioned above required at least a 10-14 day wait. Advice: If you are a first-time bride and you want to bring your parents or friends and have \"the experience\" Kasia's should not be your first shop. For that, Weddings 826 and Bhldn had wonderful dressing rooms, champagne etc. I really enjoyed both. Macy's also provided a nice experience and a surprisingly good selection for my budget (but no pics allowed) and I highly recommend Elyssa as a consultant there.I feel like Kasia's should be around your 3rd stop, once you have an idea of what you want, at least as far as silhouette and you're ready to get down to the business of buying.I worked with Kasia's mom for the first 1/2 hour and she was really helpful. Even if she doesn't share your aesthetic, she is still a seamstress with decades of experience who can tell you what is fitting you well and what isn't. I didn't go to hear I looked pretty in everything (go to David's Bridal for that, totally meh) I went for an honest opinion. What I appreciated most was that once Kasia arrived and took over the appointment, I got basically the same opinion on the fit of my final two dresses as her mother had and some tips from Kasia that helped me make a decision. They were totally unbiased because both dresses were the same price. Even if the Mori Lee had been higher priced, I don't think they would have tried to talk me into it. They wanted me to pick the dress that flattered me most.After no pressure to buy, even though it was the end of the day for them, I felt like I was able to truly pick my dress on my own. I wound up in something totally different than what I'd gone in for! And my $1,000 budget? I came in $250 under thanks to fitting into the sample size, which was new and in pristine condition. And the best part is, you are dealing with the owner. She has the power to wheel and deal. Don't be afraid to ask her about discounts etc. Once I go back for my alternations in a few months, I'll probably update this rating to a 5.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 9, 1]}, "31": {"description": "In response to Kathy L:I'm not sure what your trying to imply by saying you don't have me in your book for an appointment - my appointment was in September so perhaps you need to go a little further back. I don't appreciate the insinuation though - I left a review to be helpful to other brides. I am certainly not making anything up and I am not confused about what store I was at. Since we are now clear on that, let me address the other points.The dresses in back may be kept in bags - none the less - they were dirty compared to the dresses I tried on in other salons. The dresses on the sale rack in the bridal area were in horrible condition and NONE were in bags. Many were expensive gowns at one point, but the fact that they were crammed into the racks and left there meant they had torn lace, dirt, and in some cases holes. I'm sorry but that is the absolute truth. Blue by Enzoani - Well yes, one of the reasons I decided to make an appointment at your shop was because I was specifically looking for dresses by this designer. However, since you take the designer labels off of the dresses and will not tell client the designer of the dresses they are trying on, and ALSO are not able to pull requests based on the designers style number because they are renumbered when entering the store - all that makes it very difficult to know what is being tried and what isn't. You may have had the dress I ended up purchasing at another boutique (an Enzoani dress in fact) but it never made it into my dressing room - and the 900$ dress that was my runner up never made it in for me to try on at your shop either. \u00a0So I can only conclude that either you did not have the dresses there, or the consultant helping me was not very good at pulling dresses.So - based on all the factors above I will again recommend that \"brides to be\" go elsewhere.", "rating": "2", "date": [2010, 1, 19]}, "34": {"description": "I've been really lucky in the process of wedding planning so far - I've gotten to work with some fantastic vendors! \u00a0Kathy of Kasia's Bridal is a delight, and I had a great time trying on dresses at her store.We called about 2.5 weeks beforehand to get an appointment. \u00a0It's waaaaaaaaay out west on Irving Park, so we hopped in the car and headed out. \u00a0(Irving bus goes out there too.) \u00a0Once we arrived, we were given a book of dresses and instructed to flag the ones I wanted to try on. \u00a0We were also given mimosas, which was a nice touch!The staff here was a well-oiled machine - one gal helped me into and out of the dresses, and another was on standby to wrap up or unwrap the next dress. \u00a0And everybody was friendly and helpful - no high pressure sales tactics here. \u00a0When they saw I didn't like something, they moved onto the next one, no questions asked. \u00a0The best part? \u00a0I'm a plus-sized gal, and they had samples in lots of different sizes I could try on. \u00a0I've heard so many horror stories about gals going to bridal shops and being told to \"imagine how the dress looks on you\" or, even worse, having it pinned to your underwear to \"give you an idea of how it will look on you\". \u00a0YUCK. \u00a0You'll find none of that at Kasia's. \u00a0I tried on lots of dresses, and found the dress I'll be wearing in my wedding!It's not super-fancy, so if you're looking for the whole \"I'm a princess\" experience, this probably isn't your store. \u00a0But if you want great dresses, great prices, and great service, check out Kasia's.", "rating": "5", "date": [2009, 11, 15]}, "16": {"description": "Absolutely LOVE this place!!

Every time I came to the shop I made an appointment in advance and every time we had to wait at least 15 minutes, which is not terrible, but a little frustrating. At our first visit, when I picked \"the one,\" my mom started to take a picture of me in it and we were yelled at. From reading reviews before coming to the shop, I knew this might be a problem, but we explained that we were about to go pay for the dress and just wanted a picture in it and were still told that we couldn't, which seemed a bit silly since we were about to drop a lot of money on something we weren't going to see for months. At my first appointment, the owner had a personal emergency and couldn't be there so I was told I needed to come back to get measurements taken, etc. So I returned a few days later with the shoes I was going to wear for my wedding day. The owner took the appropriate measurements, and convinced me to get a custom length (at not additional charge) even though I told her I felt the length was perfect. She also told me I was in between sizes and I said that I planned to lose weight for the wedding, so I felt going with the smaller size would make sense and she cautioned me against it, but ultimately agreed.When my dress finally came in nearly 7 months after ordering and about a month before the wedding (and the only reason I got it then was because I called the shop to check in... no one had called me yet) it was a disaster. I had already decided to get alterations elsewhere because of my frustration with the disorganization of the shop, and I'm glad that I did. My dress came in about 3 inches too long (despite wearing the exact shoes I wore when she took my measurements) and about two sizes too big... I did lose weight, but only about 5 pounds which certainly does not justify a two (and a half) size discrepancy. Before leaving, I was talked into purchasing a bustier and slip for about $200 that my seamstress later told me I didn't need... but of course, no return on undergarments...I am very thankful to have bought such a lovely dress from Kasia's and was very happy to support a local business instead of buying a generic dress from a big corporation.

There was plenty of place to sit even for myself with 4 people and another bride and her entourage. Kathy was super helpful as well as her mother. Oh did I mention not only am I a plus bride I am only 5 feet tall. So they gave me their honest opinions on the dress and advice on the alterations. I narrowed my search to 2 dresses came back the next day with my mom. Never once feeling pressured to buy that minute. Then came back again a week later with my dad and step mom I purchased the dress in full. I was not charged for a gown back it was complimentary.

She is a very small girl, who did not need a dress 3 sizes too big, was directed to order it that way and paid for the extra material she told them she would not need! The owner is not very involved and not very friendly.. She seems interested and involved before payments and signatures are taken and after, she has little to no involvement.. \u00a0My cousins dress did not come in when we were told it would arrive, more like a month later! Which left her scrambling and not able to add the pink frill she wanted at the bottom of her dress before her big day! \u00a0I was the maid of honor, and our dresses were chosen to be worn again. I did NOT have that option!!! My dress size was ordered in another bridesmaids size and with the wedding being so close I could not have my proper size reordered. I had to take it to another seamstress for her to do what she could, and even then, the center buttons down the back to my one shouldered black lace dress was 2 inches to the right, there was nothing she could do.. Very uncomfortable.My aunts dress was specifically chosen from swatches Grace gave her to choose from in a deep purple, and her dress came in a cranberry. She ended up being forced to buy the incorrect dress, wore that for the rehearsal dinner, and went to Carson's and found a dress for the actual wedding.... IN PURPLE!!! The other bridesmaids dresses were a disaster as well. One being ordered in the completely wrong style and the other ladies were charged over $200 for their alterations. Just ridiculous!  Oh, and not to mention the brides dress came with a $200 accessory- when my cousin chose a birdcage veil, that ended up being $210 with taxes, kasia so nicely let her know she would take care of the difference.. Like all the damage already done to the dresses and mother of the brides dress wasn't enough, she had to act like she did them a favor? \u00a0UNPROFESSIONAL! \u00a0I'd rather pay out the extra money then have a headache like that ever again...

Mainly because of 3 of their store policies:1) No designers - I understand that it must be very competitive in the bridal gown industry. The reason I went to Kasia's is because they came up in an online search for where to buy a certain designer that I really liked from pictures online. I was completely confused when the consultant refused to tell me what designers made the dresses that I was trying on. At first I thought she didn't know, then at the end of the appointment when I asked the final time she said that she wasn't allowed to tell me the designer. 2) No clamps - sample dresses will almost never fit a person just right as is and need to be altered. Every single other salon that I went to provided industrial clamps to give me the idea of how the dress would look when it was fitted to my shape. Kasia's however refuses to clamp the dresses because it \"damages the samples\". This was very irritating during my appointment because the consultant had to keep running around behind me pulling at the dress to show me how it would fit. This prevented me from being able to move freely in the dress and get comfortable in it. I could not envision walking down the aisle in any dress with the consultant trailing awkwardly behind me.3) No pictures - I know this is done at a few other salons as well, but it still a big complaint for me. I remember really liking a couple dresses I tried on at Kasia's, but since I tried on more dresses at another salon after my appointment here, now I can't even recall what the dresses at Kasia's looked like. Due to reason #1 above, I also could not look up the dresses online to see if I should go back and give them another try. In the wise words of one of my bridesmaids, \"buying a wedding dress should be like buying a car\". There are many dealerships that a person could go to, and it is the sales persons job to sell you the car, not make it feel like the car is a secret make and model and prevent the buyer from shopping around at other places. I prefer to make my large purchasing decisions based on the quality of service and care I receive throughout my decision making process, not the pressure the business puts on me in the moment.Kasia's is really a nice boutique with kind people.

Kasia's had my dream dress, but there was some drama when it arrived and didn't fit properly.

Kasia's carries many different styles of gowns in all difference price ranges. The owner, Kathy, is great. She took her time and spent over 2 hours with me and my mom when we were shopping for a dress. I came back several months later to look for bridesmaid's dresses and worked with Kathy again. She let us pretty much tear the shop apart, pulling samples off the rack to try on. This was the first store I looked at for 'maids dresses and I found the perfect dress. My bridesmaids, span 20 year age range and range from size 4 to size 24 - so my challenge was finding a dress that they would be comfortable in, no matter their age or size. Kasia's had the perfect dress that all my 'maids really like and feel comfortable in and look fabulous in. Each time I visited the shop with my 'maids, I worked with Kathy. She made us feel really comfortable and right at home. \u00a0My mom bought her Mother of the Bride dress here too. \u00a0Kasia's had a large selection (however many of the dresses for MOB and special occassion are sold as-is and cannot be ordered in different sizes or colors) and my mom found a great dress that was sold as-is for nearly 50% off MSRP price. With a few small alterations, it will still be a fraction of the cost of ordering a dress in the perfect size and color. K & K Dressmaking, right in Kasia's does alterations and Grace is the seamstress. Both Kathy and Grace exhibit a ton of knowledge about the construction of dresses and when shopping for dresses Kathy is able to tell you the types of alterations or modifications that can be made to a dress. Kathy also has a great knowledge of the Designers that she carries and her imparting that knowledge while we were dress shopping was helpful and made me feel comfortable that I was selecting bridesmaids dresses from a professional who knows the business (not just a consultant who knows gowns and grabs some off a rack and tells you that you look great in it). Several things to note - it is a family run business, and I am OK with that. I proudly support small business in my community. While we were there, various family members, children and even pets wandered into the shop. I, personally am OK with that. Each time, Kathy was apologetic - but I don't mind. I'd prefer to shop here and support a small business, rather than large retailers where your money is going to splashy ads and to pay tons of sales associates waiting for a client to walk through the door so they can jump on you like a vulture. Kasia's is also on Irving Park Rd and parking is street parking and requires you to pay at a pay box. Just be prepared that parking rates are $3-4 an hour. Lastly, Kasia's is no-frills - exterior and interior. If you want champagne and heavy curtained fitting rooms and walls of mirrors and lights, go someplace else.

When the dresses did finally come in, she claimed to have called me - definitely not the case. I end up having to call her and she says \"Oh - I called and said they were in 2 days ago \" - I know for a fact I did not miss any calls from her, as I was waiting very patiently FOR that call, but she insisted that it was my fault and I must have missed that call. She straight up lied AND was rude about it. No apologies whatsoever, when I was nothing but polite on the phone.

She claimed she tried to call us to let us know there would be construction happening during out appointment. In fact, she never called my or my maid of honor, we had tried to call the shop to confirm the appointment and there was no answer.Once we got inside and started trying on dresses, I felt the customer service was lacking.

They had none of the dresses.They also seem very afraid you will find a dress there and take your business elsewhere. All style numbers of the dresses were blacked out with a marker and when we inquired as to a specific dress to send a photo of it to a bridesmaid who could not join us that day, the consultant became very mean and told us she would not tell us the style and no pictures were allowed.We won't be back .", "rating": "2", "date": [2009, 9, 8]}, "20": {"description": "I went to Kasia's Bridal in the fall of 2008. It's taken me a long time to write this review because I wasn't sure if I wanted to post it but in the end I decided that it's important for other people to know. My sister and I visited Kasia's to search for a bridesmaid dress. Kathy was very helpful and friendly. We didn't find exactly what we had been looking for but we really wanted to get our dresses from Kasia's (my sister had gotten her bridal gown from here) so we settled on a dress that we felt just okay about. I put down my deposit and then all we had to do was wait for the other bridesmaids to send in their deposits and measurements. A month or so later, my sister realized that she really didn't like the dress we had picked out so we decided to go back into Kasia's to see if we could find something we liked better. Since the dress hadn't been ordered yet, I figured the deposit could be used to order a different dress if we did find one we liked better than the original. If not, we would stick with the first we had found. When we get into the shop, Kathy tells us that the dress I had put a deposit on for had been discontinued. She never called or emailed to tell us. Had we not gone in that day, when would she have told us? She insisted that she had no way of knowing when dresses would be discontinued (Which I'm not sure is true. I've visited several bridal shops since and all have told me that they are alerted well in advance if a dress is to be discontinued). We looked around and couldn't find what we were looking for so I figured I could get my deposit back since she had never placed the order and the dress was discontinued. Kathy told me that there was no way for me to get my deposit back because her computer \"didn't have a refund button\". \u00a0I understand that a deposit is like a promise to purchase an item but if the retailer can't deliver on the item, shouldn't the deposit be refunded? She told us it was our fault because the other bridesmaids hadn't sent in their measurements in yet. But wouldn't she just have been taking more deposits for a discontinued dress? She accepted money and never delivered a product. After some discussion, she told us that though she couldn't give us a refund, she would hold on to the deposit as credit that we could use in the future. I figured it was better than nothing. Fast forward to summer 2010. I got engaged and though I didn't want to get my dress from Kasia's, I figured it just made sense since I had credit there and she never mentioned anything about an expiration date. I called Kasia's and received the strangest response. I spoke with Kathy and she told me that the store's policy never included store credit. Also, there's no way of knowing how much my deposit had been because they do not store records past 6 months/1 year. She kept saying management had changed so she can't be held accountable for whatever the management had told me back then. According to their website, Kathy has always been the owner of Kasia's and the only person I had ever worked with throughout this whole ordeal so I'm not sure what she meant by \"management has changed\". She was very defensive and so I changed my approach and told her that it was my fault for not getting the store credit agreement in writing on paper and for periodically checking in. When I told her that I had just gotten engaged and wanted to get my dress from Kasia's, she told me that if I could find my original deposit slip, we could maybe work out some kind of discount. I found my original deposit slip and emailed Kathy to confirm everything we had discussed. I never heard back from her. I could have continued to fight this but I've run out of energy and it's simply not worth it. Since this whole ordeal, I've visited several bridal shops and I always ask what would happen if the dress were discontinued after giving them my deposit (this experience has left me paranoid). All have said that my deposit would be returned and that this wouldn't happen anyways since they know well in advance when dresses are to be discontinued and are pulled from the floor. I know that Kathy will respond to this review with a comment denying this and placing the blame on me (as she has done for almost every negative review on yelp) but after speaking with several other bridal retailers, I am confident that what happened was unfair. I've done my best to keep my personal opinions out of this review and to make it objective. But I just have to say, on her website, she states that \"I went to a bridal house and ordered my dress almost 2 years in advance. Do you know that I never received my dress, nor did I ever get my money back for it!.. I decided to open up a bridal shop of my own, and VOWED that I would never treat a client the way that I was treated, and more so, not cause brides and grooms the same nightmare-ish agony I experienced, during their happy time.\" Sounds awfully familiar.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 2, 20]}, "36": {"description": "I called for an appointment after hearing a positive opinion from a friend who recently bought her wedding dress (off the rack, no alterations!!) at Kasia's.

The employees were all attentive, but not hovering or pressuring in any way. I eventually found my dress at an incredible price. I also purchased a lovely veil that matches quite well. The veil was half off since I bought a gown and I got a 5% discount on the gown for paying cash.

The server never opened our wine bottle and had to be flagged down for more water. Rolls come out pretty fast, but that was the highlight. They were not rolled tight enough, there was too much gunk (sauce) on top and the fish didn't taste good. Oh, and our bottle of wine sat unopened the entire meal.
