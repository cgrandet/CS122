Las pupusas de loroco \u00a0y las de revuelta (had to bust out the Spanish here!) were perfect and not greasy at all. \u00a0Loroco is a Salvadoran flower bud that tastes kind of like spinach when cooked. Revuelta is a mixture of minced pork, beans and cheese- the trifecta of tastiness. As I said, both were excellent and reminded me a lot of how my grandma and aunts make them.In addition to the pupusas, we orderd yuca frita (fried yucca root) and sweet plantains. The yuca frita came with fried pork chunks that were killer! The only thing I would add is perhaps a side of mojo for dipping. Instead, I used the complimentary salsas and was perfectly happy. Not everyone likes to dip their yuca, I happen to be a dipper. The sweet plantains (platanos maduros) were just how I like them- lightly fried and not soaking in oil. You also get a healthy portion for the price. At the end of the night, my husband and I ate like kings and still had food left over to take home. This feast cost us the hefty price of.... $27. Yep, just $27 total for the BOTH of us for six pupusas, yuca frita, platanos, and soft drinks. You can't beat the price! Need I mention that this place is BYOB? Yes. Hell yes. So not only is the food tasty and cheap, but you can also bring your own booze which makes the deal even better. Looking over the menu I noticed they had virgin margaritas. Perhaps they will let you bring your own tequila? I know most BYOB places only allow beer and wine, but it couldn't hurt to ask next time!

The pate was fine, ratatouille was extremely overcooked and tasted like it had been reheated a dozen times. Then I had the Poulet Grand-Mere, terrible mistake, not good at all. Taste-less boiled chicken, thrown in the oven to crisp the skin, over a bed of gravy with pearl onions, baby potatoes, and bacon. Flavors didn't mesh well at all, I ended up picking out the pieces of bacon and potatoes instead. My companion had the onion soup, very nice and flavorful. We ended with the almond butter cake and it was pretty good. A little dry, could've used a butter sauce over it, but the flavor was good.

Knowing this, we called Lou's at around 6:15pm to inform them, we'd likely be arriving around 7pm and it would be in our best interests if our pies were ready at that point, if possible, since we had an engagement at 8pm. If this was not possible, we would have moved on with our lives. Lou's said this was more than possible and that the pies would be ready. Getting them to go was an option, but the employee on the phone assured us that dine-in would be a smooth process in our time range. Arriving at 7pm, as stated, we informed them of our arrival, obviously, expecting a table. Long story short, we got a table at around 7:30pm and didn't get our first of two pizzas until 7:45pm. We had told them to just make them to go at that point but the first pizza didn't get the message. We ended up eating the entire first pizza in 5-7 minutes since we had to hustle to get to our 8pm destination.The servers were pretty annoyed at us since we asked about the ETA of our pizzas a few times and eventually got one of the pies to-go.

Since this was a part of the food tour, I did not get to really experience the dine-in or service experience, so this review is strictly on the food. We were first served a small Malnati salad, which was a mix of romaine lettuce, some small tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms. There was also a choice of salami bits and cheese that can be sprinkled over the salad. The salad was mixed with some balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was actually really good. Then, we were served a slice of sausage deep dish pizza. Let's just say that their pizza... is absolutely amazing!! After eating here, I now understand why Chicago is known for their deep dish. Maybe not all Chicago deep dish, but definitely the deep dish here at Lou Malnati's! Their cheese is so good and the combination between the amount of cheese and sauce was literally the perfect ratio. Unlike other pizza, you really do get your meat in every bite. There was a layer of sausage beneath the cheese so that was just super delicious. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for those who have not tried Chicago's deep dish pizza.

A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience. \u00a0I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 7, 20]}, "10": {"description": "When in Chicago, one must try their famous Deep Dish Pizza.

People were eating in what looked to be a waiting room.I ordered a buttercrust deep dish with sausage, mushrooms, and garlic. The sausage was AMAZING.

I went for a massage hoping to have a relaxing experience, as everyone does. I've had a very disrespectful treatment by the masseuse here. I am sure other therapists are professional and nice, but the therapist who got assigned to me, Lana, was very very rude. I asked her to adjust the pressure a couple times for a deep tissue and she just got impatient and angry with me. When I told her that she was ruining my experience there, she misunderstood and said that she had 15 years of experience. I clarified again that I wasn't doubting her experience, but I was just saying that she was making my experience there unpleasant by getting angry and impatient for no reason. She got extremely confrontational! I told her I couldn't have her work on me if she was going to emit angry, negative energy like that. She just stomped out. I was shocked cause in my experience of getting massages anywhere, therapists were gentle, as they should be. But this therapist, Lana, was oblivious and insensitive. As I said, I am sure other therapists here are fine, I haven't experienced them first hand, but to say that this experience was unpleasant, would be an understatement. It was very disrespectful! It was a waste of time and parking $ for me. \u00a0Heavenly massage should teach their therapists some courtesy as well as social skills and instill in them a pleasant nature. Thanks again for the worst massage experience ever.8/18/2014 - Update this morning. I have bruises on my upper back from my 15 minute experience with this therapist, Lana.

I'm a runner whose IT bands are always screaming, so I'm always looking for good deals on massages. I couldn't pass this one up.I was paired with Kesha, a woman of Eastern European extraction who has been expertly trained. A lot of the time, women massage therapists rely too much on elbows, etc. because they don't have the physical strength to apply the right kind of pressure. Kesha used great balance with this -- she worked out sore areas and tight muscles I didn't even know I had. After my time was up, I was begging for more! I also love the steam shower after the massage. It was just what I needed.I was surprised that a place like this had no separate changing room. And honestly, I think their off-Groupon prices are a bit high for what you get. It's a nice place but it's not really a \"high-end\" spa. $65 was just about right for a 90-minute deep tissue, based on the overall amenities.

I went to ST\u012aL a week ago today and got a Gelish no-chip manicure and a regular pedicure. I learned some very helpful tips about no-chip nail services. First of all, Shellac, Gelish, + OPI are all brands that produce a type of no-chip gel polish. Each brand uses different ways to produce their no-chip polishes and due to this, removing them from nails may have different processes. This is helpful for me to understand so that when a nail tech asks me what brand I have on my nails, I can help her to remove it properly without damaging my nails as she will understand what is needed based on the brand of no-chip I have on my nails. From my understanding, Gelish + Shellac brands use a softer type of formulation that is easier to remove than brands that use a harder more chalky formulae like OPI. Keep this shit in mind the next time you get a no-chip service as this helps the nail tech better remove your no-chip saving you time and damage to your nails. I do hope that helps someone out there! Now on to my experience:I got into ST\u012aL at 9am to get my mani/pedi with Iris. Iris is super sweet and when I tell you she got all the dry skin off my feet I mean she got \"to work on Myra's feet!\" If you've never watched Martin, that last line won't be funny to you + you don't have any idea what I'm talking about. In other words, my feet were cleaned up, perfectly polished, no dry skin in sight. I had some issues getting my previous no-chip mani removed (by OPI and I had no idea I had OPI as I specifically asked for a Shellac no-chip but Stela educated me on how nail shops will just give you whatever no-chip brand of polish they offer regardless of what you ask for if you're not clear on the differences in the brands of polishes). I do prefer the Gelish or Shellac as they are softer gel no-chip polishes. Stela made sure to take care of me and my nails and after Iris painted them perfectly, she double-checked them to be sure that they were perfect. The customer service is impeccable AND my nails... I am really in love with them. I feel like they really care about the actual health of the nail as well as the aesthetic. I haven't frequented many nail salons as I just feel like so many don't get it and my nails have been ruined to look just ok for a week or two, but ST\u012aL GETS IT.

Every year for my birthday I like to splurge on a nice massage. Last year I went to the Dana Hotel for a massage and I guess they set the bar extremely high because I was unbelievably disappointed with Stil. Whoever I made the reservation with over the phone was very pleasant. The spa itself is a little harder to find because there's only a small sign outside. My friend Joanne and I arrived and waited at the front desk for awhile before we were greeted. The waiting area itself is pretty cute- a little warm though because the sun beats in through the window. While waiting I was expecting to w offered a beverage- many of the reviews I read prior to our visit said that they were offered wine while waiting. No one even offered us water. I have a feeling it's because my friend and I look so young- but c'mon, at least ask...I am used to the spas where you're given a robe and slippers and wait in lounges where there are drinks and nibbles before you're taken to the massage room. This place doesn't offer anything like that. My masseuse came to retrieve me from the lobby and took me to a very tiny room for my massage.

My nail experience elsewhere typically involves adding our names to a list and not being able to add my friend until she gets there and waiting around with 10 other girls for a nail technician to open up. It's a huge game of trying to time it so you can sit next to each other, because the whole point is getting your nails done together so you can chat and catch up, which rarely ends up happening. Usually you end up at different times or sitting farther away from each other. The salon was quiet, no one sitting around waiting, except your technician who was there and ready to go when you got there. Victoria, who did my manicure and pedicure was a complete perfectionist! All of the women working there, including the woman working reception and Victoria were very friendly. The salon is clean, quiet, relaxing, and so far from the experiences I had elsewhere I was blown away. The best surprise was they have excellent pricing!! They had some specials going on and my friend's no chip was only $35!

I called and made an appointment as required by the youswoop and proceeded to show up for my appointment the following day. When I walked in, the salon was definitely busy. Every employee was with someone including Tina, who I have read about on Yelp reviews before I headed there. She did not get up to greet us, but just asked us to step over to her. I told her I was here for my appointment and she told me my appointment was an hour later, and proceeded to argue with me about what time the appointment was at. After futile discussion, I walked away to wait and she even continued to call after me about how she was right. Talk about embarrassing, not only for myself and yourself, but making a scene in front of about 20 other clients. Needless to say, unimpressed from the start with customer service.We decided to wait the hour anyway, since we had already traveled the distance there and I really wanted my nails to look nice for that evening and my birthday plans. Unfortunately nowhere was it posted that the establishment was BYOB and no other customers had a drink, so the drinks we had brought went unopened. At that point I felt way too awkward to even ask. Strike two, since it was advertised as such, and that was half the reason I bought the youswoop in the first place. We ended up waiting not only the hour, but another half and hour after, because two other girls came in who had an appointment earlier than our alleged \"appointment\" time. Waiting an hour and a half for a scheduled mani/pedi should NEVER EVER happen. Ridiculous. Throughout this entire waiting time, not one employee came up to speak with us or try to show any kind of appreciation that we were still waiting. Finally got to the mani/pedi. The gentleman who took care of me was very kind, and kept up friendly conversation with me. The nail job was pretty well done, I've had better but definitely a good job.

LuxBar opened in September, 2005, in the historic Gold Coast region of downtown Chicago. LuxBar is yet another huge success by Steve Lombardo and Hugo Ralli, from Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House fame. LuxBar was inspired by the work of Adolf Loos whose \"American Bar\" was designed and built in early 20th Century Vienna. The bar captured an elegance in simplicity; a style that greatly influenced the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and other American architects in the \"prairie school.\" Stone, glass, brass and wood bathed in natural light, presence in the neighborhood is welcomed and profound. This is a special place by design.LuxBar is often referred to as a \"neighborhood saloon\" and is designed to convey that same simple elegance, just remember that the neighborhood is where you'll find the 40-something Neurosurgeons and Hedge Fund Managers mixed with the 30-something tourists and the 20-somethings lost from Division and Rush.The food is feel good fresh, natural and easily understood. Artisanal in style, the menu reflects what the partnership views as an accessible cornucopia of what you might eat on just any occasion. I feel like I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have always been extremely pleased. Some of my favorites are the filet mignon sliders, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and jumbo lump crab cake. Sometimes, they don't have what I want on the menu, and I'll have them make me something. My usual is a toned-down Caesar salad with light dressing and grilled chicken.The specialty cocktails are from natural, fresh ingredients: simple elegance. My favorite is starting with a glass or two of Champagne and from there, most of the bartenders mix me up my favorite fruity vodka drinks. Although, the \"Drink Book\" has a very impressive list of specialty cocktails, \"Make Your Own Manhattan,\" wines, drafts, spirits, etc. For example, the bourbon list goes on for 2-3 pages, so you will definitely find anything you're looking for, and much, much more.The staff at LuxBar is trained in the customer care philosophy that has made Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo's Frog Bar and Fish House famous for legendary service. I enjoy the pleasant mix between the staff knowing my order and chatting, but not getting too personally involved. I have always received impeccable service.Oh, and for all of you restroom obsessed Yelpers, like most quality bars and restaurants around Division and Rush, there is a restroom attendant who makes sure that not only the restroom stays spotless, that also there are plenty of beauty accoutrements for even the most picky, so make sure to bring some cash to tip accordingly. Of note...Parking is usually very difficult. The easiest for me, is to take a cab and get dropped off. Also, there is valet across the street for the hotel, which is always very accommodating, if I happen to drive.Private Dining and Party Hosting is Available EventsLuxBar often has seasonal events, so definitely frequently check their website.This Easter Sunday, there will be an appearance from the Easter Bunny from 11am-2pm.Mondays are \"Industry Monday\" with 50% off drinks and appetizers, in the bar only, from 11am-2am.Hours:Mon-Thurs: 11:00 am - 2:00 am Fri 8:00 am - 2:00 am Sat 8:00 am - 3:00 amSun 8:00 am - 2:00 amFor more information:luxbar.comI 5/5 highly recommend LuxBar!", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 2, 15]}, "38": {"description": "Came per recommendation from the concierge, extremely busy, however got a table inside.

We couldn't have asked any more from both of them and we are very thankful.

Every item we had given them ahead of time for the event was neatly packaged in the exact same packaging in the exact same manner as it was given to them.

I emailed her with questions and she replied the same day with clear answers. I called her about an impromptu visit and she was available. She did not pressure us in any way, shape, or form.The event space was above the LUXBAR restaurant and was divided into two sections by a bar in the middle. There was a fireplace and tall windows that opened out to a small balcony. If we didn't like the furniture they would swap it with something else from another Gibson Group restaurant. They could comfortably accommodate 80 guests on each side of the space allowing us to have a ceremony on one side, switch to the other side for cocktails, then back again for a seated dinner, and move on to dancing.An open bar, passed hors d'oeuvres, and a seated two course dinner for 80 guests including tax and gratuity would cost us $12,500 on a summer Saturday evening. Our guests would have a choice of five entrees. The staff would take care of set up and clean up. If we had decorations they would arrange them for us also. We would have to bring our own dessert or pay more for theirs.We enjoyed dinner at LUXBAR in the restaurant to see if we liked the food. We had Steak Frites and a Birkshire Pork Chop (pictured). Both were seasoned and cook PERFECTLY. The meat could be easily chewed without being too soft. The sauces did not overpower the natural flavors of the meat. I am having a hard time recalling if I've ever had better cooked meat - especially without any direction to the chef. My props to Chef Michael!The fries with the steak were narrowly cut and fried crispy and seasoned. They reminded me of shoestring fries. Even though we were not impressed by the fries we couldn't stop eating them!We finished with a Seasonal Cherry Pie. We loved the crumbly crust and the locally sourced vanilla ice-cream. Beyond that, the pie was satisfying.We enjoyed two of the Build Your Own Manhattan and were delighted that they had high quality options including hand-cut ice. I also had an adult hot chocolate (Jalisco Hot Cocoa) sprinkled with paprika (delicious) followed by the Eventide. The Eventide was surprisingly ah-mazing. It mixed my favorite beer (Left Hand Milk Stout) with Few whiskey among other components. It was smooth, mature, delicately sweet, and creamy. I had two of them!Dinner, dessert, and all of our drinks cost about $150.The service at LUXBAR was incredibly professional.

The servers always made sure that our water glasses were full, which is always a sign of a great restaurant with great service!We started off with drinks, and I had the El Diabolo, a tequila based drink with ginger beer and cream de casis. It was definitely different...a little bitter but it was good! Between the four of our, we shared two appetizers. One friend and I had the tuna tartare, which really hit the spot! The tuna was very fresh, lightly mayoed and served with a good helping of fresh home chips. I really appreciated that there was more than enough chips for the amount of tartare that was there. The other two had the appetizer mac and cheese. Not the best mac and cheese I've had, but it was definitely good and tasty!Honestly, what drew me in when deciding on coming to the Luxbar was the filet and lobster sliders! It was even better that I found out when we arrived that they had a slider combo with two sliders and a side salad or soup! I also really wanted to try the King Crab bisque, so problem solved! The sliders were.....simply....to die for! The fillets were cooked to a perfect medium rare, which is pretty difficult for the size of the meat! There was also a very large piece of lobster tail on top of the two fillets. Just perfect! The bisque itself was also amazing! Very rich and creamy, however not huge pieces of crab. The flavor of crab within the soup, however, was amazing! Service was on par, with the waiter showing the perfect amount of attention and not hovering at all. We also never had to ask for a waiter when we needed it!
