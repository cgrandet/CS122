For all the hype, hoorah, and notoriety of White Castle, it was a wholly indifferent experience. \u00a0Not to say it was bad in any way; for a touristy or drunkenly enjoyed novelty, its mediocre fare. \u00a0The taste is as commonplace as bun-burger-cheese can get. \u00a0Additionally, the overall consistency (particularly of the pattie itself) is a bit reminiscent of MacDonald's or JolliBee (i.e. over-ground/processed to a soft texture).I just don't see myself CRAVING for these burgers that much...", "rating": "2", "date": [2008, 1, 4]}, "5": {"description": "This has got to be the worst White Castle.

Lots of support for retro and modern systems. But one thing that really stuck out for me was the customer service. I went in to buy an Atari 5200 some time ago. The staffer working at the counter asked me if I ever had a 5200 before, and I told him no. He actually tried to DISCOURAGE ME from buying it because of the known problems and idiosyncrasies with the Atari 5200. I assured him that as an Atari fan, I was already well aware of the 5200's quirks. He then said, \"The controller works now, but I can't guarantee that it'll still work next week.\" I told him no problem, so I bought the 5200. And wouldn't you know it....the controller died within minutes! So I checked AtariAge.com and found a very easy fix (basically, pop open the controller and glue aluminum foil to the rubber thingies that touch the contacts) that made the controller function perfectly for, so far, about a year!

It's like owning a brew pub that not only serves the best meats and cheeses, but also has a hookup on the finest ales that Asgard has to offer and then calling that place \"Humans Eat and Drink\".Now that we've covered all that I don't like about this place, let's cover all I do like. I'm a lifelong gamer, but the last console cycle really bothered me. From a XBox 360 with multiple red rings of death, to a Nintendo with no third party support that became a dust collection unit, to a PS3 who spent most of its time turned on loading and updating, I decided to buy none of the new systems these companies had to offer and instead I bought one of those Retron gimmicks that play the old cartridge based games. It's been money well spent.But with this comes the gargantuan task of finding the third party titles of my childhood that haven't been properly ported or ported at all. It's pretty tough to find good 20-30 year old games. If you walk through these doors, that task becomes less daunting.So Ion a whim I walk in here during a recent trip to Chicago. I'm instantly transported to my youth as I see a half dozen cases stacked top to bottom with cartridges. I notice a glass case by the register, and I realize this is the good stuff as I spy a hard to find copy of Final Fantasy VII on PS1 (which I currently own). So I'm looking at the case, and I instantly find a relic from my childhood- a copy of Star Fox on SNES, but with that very familiar \"Not For Resale\" bar on the sticker. It was the same copy I used to play at Woolworth's after school as a kid (yes, I was around when Woolworth's was still around, I'm old, I know, we've been through this before). I ask the guy at the counter how much, he says \"$90, but I have $14.99 copies over here\" and then leads me to the cartridges. Maybe my boyish, small town Milwaukee looks got to him, but I was really interested in that copy. But it was still a little to rich for my blood, so instead I really started shopping.So I peruse the cabinets, and I grab copies of Tecmo Super Bowl, Dick Tracy and Ikari Warriors on NES and copies of Killer Instinct (the cool black cartridge), Taz-Mania and Spiderman and the X-Men on SNES. All the games were surprisingly reasonably priced for being near downtown Chicago, I seen some of the games I bought here sell for five dollars more in Milwaukee. The girl who opened the cases was very patient with me, as I was intent on spending no more than $50 on games and I changed my mind throughout since they had so many games to offer. The cartridge selection here is at least four times bigger than the biggest cartridge collection I've encountered here in Milwaukee, and I didn't even look at their disc based games, which they had a ton of.After picking out my cartridges, I turn around to find a working Super Nintendo display like they had in the stores. I couldn't believe it.I took the games home, 5 out of 6 of them started up instantly. My Tecmo Super Bowl stalled out on the first go, but I remembered that old cartridge trick (no, you don't blow inside of it dummy! You'll ruin it that way!) A little rubbing alcohol and a Q-Tip revealed the problem, as some dirt ended up on the connecters. After the one cleaning, it was good to go, and I've been playing that game every other day since (Majkowski to Sharpe!) I can't fault then on this, with so many cartridges in stock it has to be hard to keep everyone clean.For retro gamers, this place is a dreamland and you should make time if you're in Chicago.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 7, 31]}, "33": {"description": "I lost touch with the video game world about 15 years ago, and given how much games have changed since then, I haven't had much desire to get back into it. \u00a0Still, the retro logos in the window of People Play Games drew my attention. \u00a0Eventually my curiosity won me over and I stopped in. \u00a0I had a feeling it would be like a time capsule to my grade school days of Saturday morning cartoons, pizza parties and Sega vs. Nintendo debates. \u00a0Yep, they had some artifacts that sparked old memories. \u00a0People Play Games clearly carries a ton of used games and reconditioned systems. \u00a0Some of them are really vintage, like the \"Intellivision\" that my older brother once owned. \u00a0It's fun to check out the vivid game-box illustrations that glorify the concept of the games they carry, even when the actual game graphics weren't yet able to show much more than stick figures. \u00a0I also had a good time checking out old issues of the magazine Nintendo Power, a monthly source of excitement for me as a kid.Any products of the 80s and 90s will have some serious nostalgia when they stop in People Play Games. \u00a0You might even get motivated to dig up that old gaming system from your folks' attic and give it another try.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 1, 31]}, "43": {"description": "I recently wrote a review for The Exchange and I compared it to People Play Games saying it was better...but to be honest...this store is quality.I stopped in here to look a few old games and noticed that they sell old systems that have been cleaned and tested.

It's simply awesome. But you need to know the special Lou's eating method to maximize it's awesomeness.First: Why the scraper method,and what does it do for you?Lou's serves deep dish pizza in a delightfully flaky buttery crust that isn't completely overwhelming or ridiculously large like Papa Murphy's or other related national chain embarrassments. Pizza here is served molten hot with cheese so fresh you'll want to slap it. The food is so good and flavorful that one bite is so overwhelmingly delicious your palette cannot process it all at once. It has to be taken in separately to really enjoy it, thus the scraper method.Next, what's the method?With a knife and fork in hand, cut a 1\" square piece from a pizza, then scrape the toppings off of the pie crust. Then, using the knife, stretch the cheese several times around your fork until it breaks. Doing this will release the hidden flavor oils in the cheese that will simply melt in your mouth with sheer delicious awesomeness. Then, eat the crust portion. This will again release the same flavors with an unexpected buttery note that will just rock your world. It really is a great combination but I find eating both in one bite is just too much to handle.Be sure to save room for the pizza cookie a'la' mode. I ask for cherries on top and it caps the experience off with a great note!

Wow, those two dishes were the highlight of our meal.The Octopus was extraordinarily well prepared, tender and lightly browned, perfectly seasoned with an olive oil and lemon herb sauce. Easily my favorite dish that we tried.Coming in at a close second is the Turkey Leg Confit, which is fall off the bone tender. Truly amazing and tasty...it's one of the must try items at the restaurant.The PIG'S EAR WITH CRISPY KALE, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPERS AND FRIED EGG was interesting, lightly spicy and good, but fried foods can only get so good, even if the other ingredients are market fresh and well prepared. It's worth the culinary adventure to try it, but it won't be the favorite thing you order.The MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOES gets a lot of recommendations, but it's good in a home cooking sort of way. It's not a dish that really allows the kitchen to shine.Similarly, the MORTADELLA AND SCAMORZA CHEESE SKEWER is nice, but mild tasting and not something that you'd brag to your friends about eating.So of everything we ordered, two items were truly outstanding, and will draw us back.

Well, Bohemian House does this and more.I had a birthday celebration dinner here with friends. The four of us could only get an early Sunday reservation because this place is so popular. \u00a0The mood is a contemporary reinterpretation of eastern European with long tables, cozy booths, and separate tables for two two four. Service was friendly and professional. The food, however, was AMAZING. The flavors and complexity of the recipes were like no Czech food I've ever had. The palate is rich, but the execution is actually light enough to not feel like you just ate a bag of potatoes. Thre drinks were interesting, nice takes on an artisanal Czech thing with beer foam finishes or Becherovka liqueur as an ingredient. All in all, I would say that the drinks left just a bit to be desired; but mind you, I had just had a drink and a half at Broken Shaker around the corner, and that's probably one of the toughest acts to follow I can imagine. They have a take on a Moscow mule with grilled rosemary that had a better execution with the second drink, according to my friend. \u00a0The beer list is pretty impressive. I liked the options, but honestly, the prices which start at about $10 for a draft were a little steep.The food shined. We had four appetizers. All were delicious, but the chicken livers were silky and crazy delicious with the hazelnuts and plums. Also, the fried potato bread with fresh grated gouda was amazing. Beef cheek pierogi were also tasty and hearty, and the rye bread crumbs with the soft boiled egg on the brussels sprouts salad made them way above average.I had the goulash with the blood sausage and braised beef. Wow. So hearty and rich! The cloud like Czech bread dumpling was nothing like grandma used to make. Sorry grandma, this Greek executive chef just showed you up in the knedlicky department! The sauce was almost like a beefy barbecue sauce. The other star was the Spaetzle entree with hen of the woods mushrooms and emmenthaler cheese. This was fantastic. Two of our diners had the duck breast, and the portion was hearty. They liked it but didn't rave about it like we did with the goulash and spaetzle.We got a free dessert because it was my birthday. The coffee ice cream and fresh donuts were really good, rolled in cinnamon sugar. The dark chocolate custard, however, was amazingly rich and good. We all shared.This place isn't exactly cheap.

What a disappointment. Although the service has been solid all around, the food itself has proved to be overpriced and mediocre. We got the potato pancake to start and it was decent but not close to being worth $14. The skirt steak (prepared medium) was tough and chewy and lacked flavor, and there was hardly any of it on the plate to begin with.

And they know it ;-) We came here on a Friday for a brewery tour and had the most memorable experience touring the facility and taproom. Located about 5 miles from downtown Chicago on S Washtenaw Avenue, you will come across a huge parking lot in an industrial area close to an L stop. This 300,000 square foot facility used to be owned by a Canadian-based Cinespace film company and now houses beer production for the California-born brewery. After Petaluma, this Chicago location produces all the Lagunitas beer east of the Rocky Mountains. As you enter the facility, be prepared to show your ID and then head down the neon blue hallway to the end where a Lucky 13 pin up girl lures you in for some beer. The first stop on the tour is the Adult Daycare room. The space has pinball machines, a dentist chair, all kinds of sofas and chairs, Jenga, board games, music and of course a bar. Take your pick from the beers on tap as your tour guide explains the lineup. We had Jake as our tour guide and he was very charismatic and fun. He had so many great stories about the history of the facility and the founder Tony. You could tell by his exuberance that Lagunitas is an awesome place to work and they have an awesome product loved by many all over the world. After a beer in the Adult Daycare, the tour continues to the main facility and you can see the huge fermenters. The fermenters are from Bavaria and the story of their transport from Germany involves shutting down highways to get them into the space. You can also see stacks of barrels that are used for the barrel-aged beers. The bottling area is next and then you will see endless stacks of Lagunitas kegs and boxes of beer ready to be shipped out. Along the tour you will hear all kinds of stories about Tony, the importance of 420, why Lagunitas sucks and how everything makes you hopstoopid. The facility is impeccably clean and very organized. As you wrap up the tour, your final stop is the Taproom. On the chalkboard are the daily beer specials. The menu offers burgers, beer mussels, nachos, soups and a few other options.

And they know it ;-) We came here on a Friday for a brewery tour and had the most memorable experience touring the facility and taproom. Located about 5 miles from downtown Chicago on S Washtenaw Avenue, you will come across a huge parking lot in an industrial area close to an L stop. This 300,000 square foot facility used to be owned by a Canadian-based Cinespace film company and now houses beer production for the California-born brewery. After Petaluma, this Chicago location produces all the Lagunitas beer east of the Rocky Mountains. As you enter the facility, be prepared to show your ID and then head down the neon blue hallway to the end where a Lucky 13 pin up girl lures you in for some beer. The first stop on the tour is the Adult Daycare room. The space has pinball machines, a dentist chair, all kinds of sofas and chairs, Jenga, board games, music and of course a bar. Take your pick from the beers on tap as your tour guide explains the lineup. We had Jake as our tour guide and he was very charismatic and fun. He had so many great stories about the history of the facility and the founder Tony. You could tell by his exuberance that Lagunitas is an awesome place to work and they have an awesome product loved by many all over the world. After a beer in the Adult Daycare, the tour continues to the main facility and you can see the huge fermenters. The fermenters are from Bavaria and the story of their transport from Germany involves shutting down highways to get them into the space. You can also see stacks of barrels that are used for the barrel-aged beers. The bottling area is next and then you will see endless stacks of Lagunitas kegs and boxes of beer ready to be shipped out. Along the tour you will hear all kinds of stories about Tony, the importance of 420, why Lagunitas sucks and how everything makes you hopstoopid. The facility is impeccably clean and very organized. As you wrap up the tour, your final stop is the Taproom. On the chalkboard are the daily beer specials. The menu offers burgers, beer mussels, nachos, soups and a few other options. Everything is natural and nothing is fried or microwaved. The staff was great and if you have time, check out the Swaag shop. The hoodies are really soft and you can purchase a little suppin and memorabilia to take home with you.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 12, 7]}, "10": {"description": "What a great place, awesome beer, even better people..What more could you ask for \u00a0it's a very cool space, impressive tour...

I am always up for checking new places so had to check it out.I was there with a friend Tuesday around 7 PM. We park right in front and and go inside. The restaurant is typical of many Mexican seafood restaurants with plastic sharks, trees and a hammock right in the middle high on the ceiling. We sit and the waitress comes with the menus, some ceviche, tostadas, crackers and habanero salsa. We ordered carne Zamora, pi\u00f1a rellena and langostinos, jarrito de mandarina and we are cool. I did not know that it is BYOB, I would've brought some coronas or tequila. Oh yea is BYOB.My friend gets a tostada, puts some ceviche and stats spooning habanero salsa like is ketchup. I tell him \"hey dude try it first, it might be hot\". \"I'll be ok\" he replied. Lol needless to say he wasn't. Lets put it this way I saw a couple of tears on his face LOL. Now I have something to bash him with for months. Point being that habanero salsa is extremely hot, beware.After my laughing about my friend trying to get rid of the burn, we get \u00a0the food. Everything was delicious. The carne Zamora comes with a good size skirt steak, cooked to perfection, a quesadilla, Mexican chorizo, whole beans, rice, grilled green onions and jalape\u00f1o. Truly delicious combination. The langostinos are good, well seasoned (not too salty or over seasoned) fresh good quality prawns.But then, the pi\u00f1a rellena (stuffed pineapple) .... \u00a0Can't find the proper term to describe it without sounding like a teenager (erase: OMG, heavenly, seriously) f*^ing perfect. The perfect combination of flavors. Half pineapple, scooped out the flesh, grilled shrimp, octopus, fish cheese and broiled. You get the sweetness of the pineapple combined with the seafood and then a little bit of heat from the hot peppers and to top it off some melted cheese. This was some serious good eating. This comes with rice, salad, garlic bread and fries.After eating all that food I wished there was more pina rellena, not because I was still hungry, or the portion (portions are huge) but because that is one of those addicting flavors that you can't stop eating (or at least I). \u00a0Yeap it was that good.Can't wait to come back on a week end. I think they have music or karaoke. At least that is what the waitress told me, service is super nice and attentive. They checked on us a few times throughout the dinner.

I've been here 3 times and each time I've regretted wasting my money here.

Not only that but he was sawing off \u00a0my nails with that small machine they use to the point I had to pull my had back. And when he was finally finished, my nails were in pain and I had nail glue stuck on my fingers. 2nd time I went to get a fill in which is absolutely a bad idea they basically just filled in the part of the nail that was exposed and had grown. The part of my nail that was exposed got sawed down just like the first time but this time it really hurt I could barely stand it! So by the time the guy (same guy from the first time) finished my fill in I was in pain again. My third time being in there I just went to get the gel nails taken off, but instead of soaking my gel nails in acetone like I thought they would do, Lynn herself decided she was just going to rip the nails off by using an unused gel nail. \u00a0She used the thin edges of the unused gel nail to get under my gel nails to disconnect it from my real nail, however as she was doing that she was ripping my real nail off as well. I was telling her ouch that hurts, \u00a0She seemed not to believe me cause she kept on with her method of taking off my gel nails. \u00a0After a while I couldn't take it anymore, \u00a0and I told her it really hurts and that I was bleeding. \u00a0So basically she hadn't even finished taking off the gel nails because that's how bad it hurt. So I left the shop without paying because I couldn't reach my credit card because my nails were in that much pain. All my nails had some sort of left over gel nail because Lynn couldn't get it off without hurting me. For nearly a whole two months I was in serious pain that I almost went to the emergency room to have them numb my fingers to get off the rest of the nails without hurting me. But luckily I was able to suck up the pain and take off the rest of the leftover gel nails. Once I had taken off all the gel nails, some of my nails had \u00a0been literally \u00a0sawed completely off that you could touch the skin of my nails, and that's when I realized why I was in so much pain because the guy who did my nails the first two times was sawing my nails down to the point it hit sensitive nerves in my nails. \u00a0My nails couldn't grow normally after that so I bought some Sally Hasen nail growth polish and now my nails are healthy and have fully grown back.

It came with texas garlic toast to help soak up the garlic sauce. I could have licked the bowl - it was that good!Since we ate everything that came out, we were already starting to get a little full. \u00a0But we were determined to have the full steakhouse experience. \u00a0So we ordered our main dishes as we had intended even before we ordered the hors d'oevres.STEAK FRITES - This little number is the best value on the menu. Very tender and flavorful skirt steak with a side of their amazing fries and garlic aioli. \u00a0Honestly, you could probably order this and nothing else. \u00a0It was very substantial and perfect in every way.CLASSIC RIBEYE CHICAGO CUT with WILD MUSHROOMS and ROASTED BONE MARROW - OMG, this ribeye is one of the best steaks I've eaten. \u00a0It very tender, flavorful, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. \u00a0The mushrooms were a great accompaniment as was the bone marrow - it was buttery and full of flavor this time around. \u00a0YES, THIS IS WHAT THE STEAKHOUSE IS ALL ABOUT! \u00a0Also, for those that want steak a bit less gamy but aged, Bavette's added a wet aged bone in ribeye to their menu (we did not try this).THICK CUT BACON - This was also another highlight from our last meal here, so we had to order it again. \u00a0Again, pork belly that was sweet, smokey, and peppery. \u00a0It's simply amazing.TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE topped with CHOPPED BACON - No, the bacon did not come with the mac and cheese, but it's worth the surcharge. \u00a0(Just read my bacon review in and of itself.) \u00a0The Mac and cheese was super delicious and the bacon just adds another element to it. \u00a0(Thanks for the idea from another yelper who posted a pic of this amazing combo previously - spot on!)Then it's time for dessert. \u00a0We actually asked to box up some of our sides so that we can make room for dessert (trust me - we were stuffed by now, but you have to have dessert for a birthday!).ICE CREAM - I choose the salted caramel and chocolate combination (you get two scoops so you can choose for each of the scoops). \u00a0Brandon brought out both the hot fudge and goldbrick sauce for us to try. \u00a0SOOOO good! \u00a0I particularly liked the dark rich hot fudge, but the goldbrick sauce was not too far behind. \u00a0This came out with a sparkler for my birthday.During our meal, Brandon was always checking on us and making sure were enjoying our food and otherwise taken care of.

Drinks: Fun and unique BYOB policy. You can bring a bottle of wine as long as you share a glass with somebody else in the restaurant. In our case, we shared a glass with the chef. Appetizers: We got the Garlic Shrimp de Jonghe and the Wedge Salad. The shrimp were amazing, the butter/garlic/sherry combination made them very rich and delicious. Our waiter helpfully pointed out that ordering the wedge salad also satisfies the bacon craving, as it comes with some healthy chunks of bacon. The salad was great as well with chunks of blue cheese, egg, and ranch dressing. Although I think the kitchen was a little heavy handed with the dill that day which overpowered a few bites. Sides: With only two of us, we only got one side so we could try to save room for dessert so we chose the Elote Style Corn which was very unique to see at an upscale restaurant. Great taste with a little kick and it was not a super heavy side so that was nice. Entrees: My wife got the 6oz filet and ordered it medium, and it was super tender and cooked perfectly. I ordered the 16oz strip steak (not on the menu) and although it was cooked a perfect medium rare, the steak itself was too tough. With a strip you don't expect the tenderness of a filet, but I order strips a lot at restaurants and this was definitely too tough. Dessert: Chocolate cream pie with oreo crust. Enough has been said about it, just get it. Service and Atmosphere: Our waiter Brandon was attentive without being overbearing, and he showed knowledge of the menu and provided us with tips and his favorite dishes.

The only \"complaint\" I have is that there was so much goodness to choose from, but so little stomach capacity to handle it all.The luscious terrine appeared like two thick slabs of ham but it's much more glamorous than that. I took pleasure in spreading a thick layer over the toast and finishing it with a smear of apricot mustard. Each bite came in layers, from tangy to peppery to a sweetened spice.As BB&B so aggressively strives to be different from a typical steakhouse, the short-rib stroganoff is without doubt, a must-try. The house-made fettucine arrived al dente and with a slow braise, the short-rib on top was particularly tender. The sauce was thick and creamy, making this dish excellent.Did I mention this was my first encounter with bone-in dry aged rib-eye? I took a slice at the rib-eye and allowed the unadorned beef to rest on my tongue for a moment to let the flavor sink in. Oh my, was that a tender and sexy beast crisped with steak salt.

Bavette's has become a standout among all the great restaurants in Chicago, and is a great choice for a date or a celebratory family dinner. It's decorated like a 1920s speakeasy with low lighting, big comfy leather booths, mirrors, and eclectic tableware, and the resulting ambiance is really special. The steaks at Bavette's are top notch. But I am personally just as wowed, if not more so, by their sides! The creamed spinach is a must-order, as is the wedge salad. In the spinach, I always taste either gruyere or bleu cheese - I can't figure out which - and it lends such richness and depth of flavor to the dish. The wedge salad is outstanding, and features a ranch-like dressing (not too thick, just right) that lightly coats the lettuce, and is complemented by a generous sprinkle of fresh herbs and thick slabs of very high-quality bacon. You can tell the dressing has quite a bit of garlic in it, but it's not overpowering. I've tried to replicate it at home from a recipe I saw on Serious Eats, and it's definitely close, but the restaurant's still can't be beat!For main dishes, I've tried the steaks, meatloaf, and fried chicken with gravy, and the chicken in particular is phenomenal. There are so many impressive and delicious-sounding options on the menu that it's hard to choose, and I'm sure you can't go wrong. I've seen the burger walk past many times and thought it looked really tasty. Might have to go with that one next time! It's smart to get reservations here, because Bavette's can fill up pretty fast. They do have a large downstairs room so the restaurant is bigger than it looks initially, but even with all that space, over the holidays my family got reservations a month in advance and could still only come at either 5pm or 9:30pm. What can I say, it's a popular joint for good reason! We also had a really wonderful server for this last dinner - he had blond hair and glasses and worked downstairs.

If you're thinking about ordering the filet mignon, I recommend going for the bone-in. We ordered it medium rare, and it was perfect. My boyfriend, being quite the steak snob, was very impressed. As always the pommes frites at Hogsalt establishments never disappoint. The mac and cheese was very rich, but delicious. I would pass on the baked potato simply because it's... a baked potato. We were just curious what a $10 baked potato was like. It was more huge than anything. I would also recommend getting the brussell sprouts to get in your veggies!For dessert, don't think and just get the chocolate cream pie. It's incredibly rich, but the VERY generous helping of whipped cream on top (which appeared to have vanilla beans in it. YUM) helped cut that richness.

No matter what time I walked past, it was always bustling and cheery and wonderful smelling.Well, seven months -- yes SEVEN MONTHS -- later, I finally had the chance to come here. I moved away from Chicago, and THIS is what I came back to try.Veneno de Nayarit exceeded expectations.There is little in this world so luxurious and decadent as eating an entire animal. At Nayarit, that is pretty much the order of the day. The entrees are a full fish, cooked in the style of your choosing, with a side salad, french fries (omg delicious), and rice. It's a little hard to tell what is going on based on the menu alone, so let me tell you what to order on a date for two:1. A large horchata to share (or two if you don't intend to share)2. the Mojarra, in the Nayarit style (I am 90% sure this is Tilapia, but if it's going to bother you if it isn't then you should look it up)This will be sufficient, unless you are very hungry, in which case you can order something else additional.When the platter comes to your table, it is HUGE. A single platter takes up a full two-person table. The fish in the Nayarit style is soaked in Nayarit sauce, which I would buy on its own. It's a great combination of spices that is flavorful and yet somehow not too spicy (unlike the salsa that they bring you before the meal, which should carry a warning). Don't forget to eat the fish cheek (it is fatty and delicious, sort of like pork belly), and don't forget to flip it over and eat the other side.They bring out a ceviche on a chip for you as an appetizer before your meal, and it is good but a little dry; the salsa, as I mentioned, is terrifyingly hot and I like spice. If you are going to eat that salsa, make sure you have horchata on hand.When it comes down to it, though, criticisms aside, for all of this food you pay something like $15, and it is a TON of food, and it is very satisfying.

My friends paid $440 cash and others paid their bill by card including me. I gave my card with the correct bill of $168 \u00a0and when they brought back my card I was brought back a different receipt of over $600! They said that they only got $38 from us, so one of the staff members pocketed the cash and accused us of not paying. The police got involved but there was not much they could do. Ultimately it was our word against theirs. And they kept changing their story. Basically they made us wait two hours till I could be refunded my money!

We had to wait for a few minutes but shortly, we were seated immediately. It's a little cozy spot and not much room to walk around so I see they tried to utilized their space as much as possible but it's very tight. We came in with a party of 3 and were given these complimentary chips with some sort of salsa on top of it and it was very tasty. For our appetizer, we half a dozen oysters. It wasn't just a regular oyster where you just had the oysters. No it had toppings with it. Packed with octopus, shrimps and a bunch of other things and it was very tasty. For our main course, we had this huge platter that had everything! Lobsters, shrimps, crab legs omg it was huge and we clearly couldn't finish it because it was a lot for just three people. It also came with sides too: fries and fried rice. The fried rice was surprisingly delicious. We also ordered salsa which we didn't know we were going to get charged extra though so that was a downer. When the bill came, i knew seafood was expensive but I didn't expect it to be that much.

You can read my appraisal of the actual food, service, and ambience below. I came with a party of 12 other medical students to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress told us that we should order a platter that was designed for 10 people, \"although it will feed 12 just fine.\" She did not tell us the price or point to the cost on the menu (although retrospectively, I see that the menu simply says \"Market Price\" for many of the platters, which further obfuscates what the cost will be). Although we certainly share blame for not asking our waitress how much it would be, we couldn't help but be appalled by the food we got and the price. There is no way a party of 10 or 12 could finish the platter (our party was not a push-over in terms of eating ability). This platter could have comfortably filled 20. We were shocked to see our bill was over 600 dollars. In my mind, I can't imagine that an individual in most parties of ten would be okay with paying over 60 dollars for a meal here. (I'll upload a photo of the meal so you can judge for yourself if my concerns are valid, and I will discuss below the actual food quality). At most I could imagine our meal deserved 30 dollars per person (and I would begrudgingly consent to that).I didn't want to make a scene at the restaurant but called thirty minutes after leaving to speak with a manager; they told me to leave my contact info and the owner would call back. Shortly afterwards the manager called back and simply told me they would offer a discount for my next visit. I don't care much for the discount, I simply wanted to talk about this business practice because I felt it was unfair. While the female manager I talked to validated my concerns and told me she too felt it this was an unreasonable price and practice. However, she did not respond to my concerns that this would happen to customers again -- and if you peruse Yelp, you will find I am not the first customer to raise this serious concern. She simply said I should call back before my next visit, and I would get a discount. (As an aside, she was unable to tell me what the discount would be -- only that it will depend on what I order. I can't help but mention how useless that is. Even if the discount is 50%, as I wrote above, that would really not be worth it for anyone in my party, personally. And who knows what the discount would be, we'd have to order before knowing?? I certainly can't make use of this otherwise good-willed gesture). The call was pleasant enough though. Congratulations for winning a star back. Ultimately, we felt cheated, like the waitress had pushed this order on us and we ended up being prey to arbitrary pricing.As for the actual restaurant and food, we were seated in extremely cramped quarters (I literally had to crawl under my table to use the bathroom -- we were abutting another table directly, and there was no way to squeeze through). The tables are cheap and covered with a plastic wrap. Our cups were small white styrofoam, and we served ourselves our own water out of a pitcher. The plates were cheap and light with antiquated design, sort of like grandma's plates. Some of the plates were styrofoam. Really, this is all par for the course for a seafood restaurant with this sort of overall atmosphere, so I'm not upset about it specifically. But it does directly conflict with the price tag of our platter, which would make you think like this was some sort of Michelin starred high-end dining experience.The food itself is certainly not bad. Somewhat overseasoned, but some people like that. The fried fish was dry and uncharacteristically underseasoned compared to the rest of the meal. The shrimp were quite overcooked, but when eating at an en-masse seafood restaurant like this where everything is cooked relatively together in tin-foil, it's to be expected. Again, it is simply not commensurate with the price, and I would caution people eating here.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 11, 6]}, "15": {"description": "I have never been big fan of seafood.
