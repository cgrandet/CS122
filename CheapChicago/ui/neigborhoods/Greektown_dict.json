He's been doing my hair for a few years at his previous salon and my experiences have been nothing but fantastic. My mother is a hair stylist and he was the first professional I ever saw outside of my mom and shhhh don't tell, but he does a better job and that says a lot.He does a fantastic job with color - he created a personal color solution for me as I am a faithful bright haired blond and it is difficult to keep it from looking brassy. My color has always ended up radiant and I have never been dissatisfied with his service. He makes great suggestions with regard to color, haircuts and the latest hairstyles and definitely knows what he's doing. Robby is extremely friendly and personable as well. I look forward to our monthly appointment as it is more than hair maintenance - it's a great social experience :)Don't waste any time or money - Ask for Robby stat!!

Especially with curly hair, I was expecting a thorough, repetitive shampoo and condition; it turned out to be very surface level. Drying my hair was fine, but when she got to the hot curler (which is an extra $10 for any thermal equipment used), she did not allow the curler to actually give heat to the curls so that the curls would stay and not dwindle away by the winds of this city. In the moment the finished product looked fine, but hours later curls were falling. I needed to use my own curling iron to ensure the curls would stay more than a day, which isn't usually the case when I get a blow out.

Saganaki was a must, just a warning if you're eating outside it doesn't get flamed at your table to avoid embarrassing situations in which your hair might catch fire. The calamari was ok, here you get the large rings but no tentacles if that's your thing. My party agreed the best dish was the lamb loin chops that were on special. They gave three nice sized chops grilled well. Everything else seemed kind of blah. The combo plate was just stuffed with food. I don't think any of it was particularly great but it was a lot. My wife got the moussaka and it just seemed like there was a big tray of it in a warmer and a square just gets plopped onto the plate. The only thing I'd have to recommend is the saganaki.

We promptly arrived but only to wait 40 minutes for our table. The host was apologetic whenever I asked how much longer it would take. To my frustration, he could not give an exact answer. First, he said our table will be ready once it is cleaned. But when I asked a second time, he stated there were four tables ahead of us. I was not pleased. The point in making a reservation is to skip a long wait. If they cannot handle the capacity, they should regulate the number of reservations to accept. We were eventually seated and we had no time to waste. For appetizers, we shared the saganaki and char-broiled octopus with lemon and olive oil. The octopus was light with a generous portion. Each piece was tender and succulent. The saganaki is the flaming cheese so do expect it to be a bit oily. It goes well with the complimentary bread or by itself. For us, one order was enough to go around. I think our waiter should have given us a heads up when it was brought out. Nobody in their right mind would want a flaming surprise within a few feet of their head full of hair. For entrees, we ordered six entrees: dolmades, mousakas, loukaniko, paidakia, vegetarian mousaka, and veggie kabob. The paidakia was the highlight of the meal. A plate came with five thin slabs of butterfly lamb chops. It was perfectly grilled with a heavy usage of Rosemary but it did not overpower the lamb's natural flavors. The meat was particularly tender and juicy. Along with the lamb chops were a side of rice and potatoes. The rest of the meal was average. The dolmades are rice and ground beef wrapped in grape vine leaves and drenched in an egg-lemon sauce. It comes with a side of green peas. If you are unfamiliar with the cuisine, the grape vine leaves are edible. We had the mousakas in two versions and their appearance is similar to lasagna. The ground beef mousaka came with eggplant, zucchini, potato, cheese, and bechamel sauce. The vegetarian version is the same but without the ground beef. Both came with a side of rice. The loukaniko is homemade Greek sausage served with a rice and potatoes. It has a slice spice and is great for sharing. The veggie kabob can be skipped.

We promptly arrived but only to wait 40 minutes for our table. The host was apologetic whenever I asked how much longer it would take. To my frustration, he could not give an exact answer. First, he said our table will be ready once it is cleaned. But when I asked a second time, he stated there were four tables ahead of us. I was not pleased. The point in making a reservation is to skip a long wait. If they cannot handle the capacity, they should regulate the number of reservations to accept. We were eventually seated and we had no time to waste. For appetizers, we shared the saganaki and char-broiled octopus with lemon and olive oil. The octopus was light with a generous portion. Each piece was tender and succulent. The saganaki is the flaming cheese so do expect it to be a bit oily. It goes well with the complimentary bread or by itself. For us, one order was enough to go around. I think our waiter should have given us a heads up when it was brought out. Nobody in their right mind would want a flaming surprise within a few feet of their head full of hair. For entrees, we ordered six entrees: dolmades, mousakas, loukaniko, paidakia, vegetarian mousaka, and veggie kabob. The paidakia was the highlight of the meal. A plate came with five thin slabs of butterfly lamb chops. It was perfectly grilled with a heavy usage of Rosemary but it did not overpower the lamb's natural flavors. The meat was particularly tender and juicy. Along with the lamb chops were a side of rice and potatoes. The rest of the meal was average. The dolmades are rice and ground beef wrapped in grape vine leaves and drenched in an egg-lemon sauce. It comes with a side of green peas. If you are unfamiliar with the cuisine, the grape vine leaves are edible. We had the mousakas in two versions and their appearance is similar to lasagna. The ground beef mousaka came with eggplant, zucchini, potato, cheese, and bechamel sauce. The vegetarian version is the same but without the ground beef. Both came with a side of rice. The loukaniko is homemade Greek sausage served with a rice and potatoes. It has a slice spice and is great for sharing. The veggie kabob can be skipped. One plate came with two skewers of tomato, onion, eggplant, green pepper, and zucchini. The items were drenched in olive oil and flavors were extremely light.

Open air on a beautiful night with an ivy covered wall and views of the buildings in Greektown is definitely an experience.

We didn't order drinks for 15 minutes and once we ordered our maybe we weren't checked on the rest of the meal. My party agreed we would have ordered at least another round of drinks if we had the opportunity. At least there were authentic Greek beers available. They tasted similar to polish and other European beers that many Chicagoans might be familiar with. The food was standard Greek fare. Saganaki was a must, just a warning if you're eating outside it doesn't get flamed at your table to avoid embarrassing situations in which your hair might catch fire. The calamari was ok, here you get the large rings but no tentacles if that's your thing. My party agreed the best dish was the lamb loin chops that were on special. They gave three nice sized chops grilled well. Everything else seemed kind of blah. The combo plate was just stuffed with food. I don't think any of it was particularly great but it was a lot. My wife got the moussaka and it just seemed like there was a big tray of it in a warmer and a square just gets plopped onto the plate. The only thing I'd have to recommend is the saganaki. It was rich and lemony and amazing. Athena was a bit of a let down for me. You get a great atmosphere but really average food.

His replies his name is Steven, I then ask for a card and he offers customer care number for Super Cuts.

I like the decor. The actual bar is setup in the middle of the space, so that all four sides are open for people to sit at. \u00a0It's nice and spacious. \u00a0The rest of the bar/restaurant is set up with tall tops throughout. \u00a0There are a good amount of large tables to accommodate groups of 6+ people. \u00a0The seats are not the most comfortable, and to be honest, they will probably not function well for a lot of people since the seating space is fairly small (I'm of a small stature and I found it borderline comfortable to sit).After seating ourselves, as the sign told us to, my friend and I had to wait about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our server and given menus. \u00a0This would be more acceptable if the place was packed, which it was not. \u00a0The server was not very attentive throughout our time there.We ordered an appetizer and entrees. \u00a0After waiting for awhile, our server came out with our entrees. \u00a0As he placed our meals down he said \"Oh...we just ran out of fried pickles. \u00a0Is there another appetizer you want to order?\" \u00a0At that point, our meals were already there, so we declined. \u00a0I thought it was odd that he didn't come and tell us that they ran out of our appetizer in advance before bringing out our food. \u00a0My friend got a burger--looked good and she said it tasted good. \u00a0My friend pointed out that her burger had pickles on it, so clearly the kitchen had not run out of pickles entirely....and yet our server told us that they ran out of fried pickles? \u00a0This made us think even more that he had just forgotten to put our appetizer order in and was making up that the kitchen ran out of it. I got the breaded buffalo chicken sandwich...however there was barely any chicken on the sandwich. The actual meat was MAYBE 2cm thick and then there was a thin cornflake breading. It was served on a telera roll with cucumber and argula. There was more argula on the sandwich than there was chicken! The sandwich came with fries, which were basic...nothing special. Our server came by and asked us to close our tab with him as he was going home and said that another server would be by our table to take over. \u00a0However, after he left another server didn't come over for at least 30 minutes....and she came over to say that it was last call. \u00a0Mind you, it was only 11:15 and they are telling us it is last call?! \u00a0There were at least 20 people in the place, so I really have no idea why they were closing so early (their website says they are open until 2:00am). \u00a0I decided to ask this server if they had fried pickles, to which she responded yes, but the kitchen is closed. \u00a0I then asked if they had run out of fried pickles and she said no. \u00a0I told her about how our first server said they had run out. \u00a0She just laughed and basically said ooops I guess I just blew his cover and he must have just not put your order in.Again, I know this place just opened, however the owners have other bars, so I wouldn't expect Tapworks to have so many problems. \u00a0I may be back....but then again, Jak's Tap is just down the street and they have food I can count on, better service and the same drinks that I'd be drinking at Tapworks.If Tapworks reads this review, some advice would be to train/re-train your current staff on better customer service and the importance of being attentive...or hire some new people who already have good server skills. \u00a0Also, I'd take a closer look at the food coming out of your kitchen, as the chicken sandwich was one of the worst I have ever had, merely because there was almost no chicken on the sandwich.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 2, 21]}, "56": {"description": "Went for lunch, but it was \"brunch\".

They have never lead me down a path that I've been dissatisfied with. They are friendly, and if you take the time to ask questions, you'll see how professional they are. I don't feel judged by them when I shake my fat ass to Dance Central or plan a night of DJ Hero with my silly friends (not like all of you reading this might be judging me).Also, this shop has parking. The shop is located well. It is a place I enjoy going to, and at the end of the day is much more the type of place to get great service then say a big box store.

Every time I come, I'm offered water or fresh hot tea. We weren't offered anything this time, but I imagine it's because we arrived so close to our start time. My therapist was Jasmin, and she was fantastic! Throughout the massage, she checked on me to see if I was ok (I had the sniffles and she kindly offered tissue). During the second half of the massage, when she had me flip to my back, I noticed the light was a little bright but decided I'd adjust and not say anything. As if she could read my thoughts, and right on time, she asked if she could adjust the lighting for me. There were a few moments like this that caused me to love her even more! She was like magic! It felt like both hands were on me the entire time, but I know she kept adding the massage lotion. I don't know how she did it but she's great! The room was a little chilly but the bed was heated and the sheets were very warm. I didn't think I would find someone after Stephen, but I'm glad I did. One thing to note: I'd decided to cancel my membership a while ago, I just hadn't gotten around to going in to do so. If you want to cancel before your one-year is up, you have to submit a written request for approval from the manager. I haven't had many memberships, so I'm open to the idea that this may be standard, but I was still taken aback. I'm now well beyond my one-year, and inquired about terminating my membership.

As a regular massage goer, I always enjoy trying new places, different modalities, and finding therapists who are skilled in what they do. Massage Envy sadly takes all the joy out of the massage experience for me.The absolute last thing I want to do when exiting my session with any therapist is to be pitched about what I can buy, and how I should sign a contract to keep coming back. Half the reason I wandered into this place was to get away from the endless stream of advertisements and commitments and contracts of my day. It is supposed to be a time to turn off all that pressure, and unwind. I certainly do not want to buy a subscription to get massages, and find it unsettling how much this idea resembles that of a gym membership. Does anyone else remember the episode of Friends where Ross and Chandler are desperately trying to get out from under a gym contract, and it becomes abundantly clear this is never going to happen?If anyone really desires to get a massage a month for a reasonable price, buy yourself a groupon or living social deal now and again. Try new places, new therapists, and then you can find what you like and what works best for you. With any luck you'll find a place that sells a package of minutes (as many places do and many individual therapists do as well), and then you can use your minutes when you like, at whatever pace you desire, and have no obligation to buy another package when your minutes are used up. And if you happen to live in the West Loop, there is a place a few blocks west of this one, called Chicago Touch, and they offer reasonable prices, and packages for those who desire to buy minutes in bulk. They've got great therapists, and have never asked me to sign a contract. You also may want to consider a massage at one of the local massage schools (ie: Cortiva, Soma, etc) where students in the final stretches of their training are doing massage at discounted rates and offer pricing even lower than Massage Envy as an every day no commitment rate. Wherever your quest for therapeutic massage lands you, I hope it is not Massage Envy, as this is not a true representation of what massage is about.

I'm surprised this place has so few stars!After reading about Massage Envy for at least a year or so, I made an appointment on exactly Sept. 30, 2013. I booked an introductory facial and massage. Both were awesome! Everyone was friendly and very helpful. Now everyone, listen closely, I personally love to research places that have memberships before I even consider speaking to an actual person about it. Why? Because an actual person's job is to get you to purchase a membership. Technically speaking no one can make you purchase anything you don't want. Even though I had already researched a lot about Massage Envy prior to this visit, I took the time afterwards to not just jump and start a membership. I asked more questions, I got my answers and more. So, there was no way I didn't know the deal beforehand. Stephanie was the one who I talked to FOREVER about the ins and outs of a membership. She was extremely patient with me, which was awesome since I really dug in and wanted to know what I was getting into. It's obvious that this chain of spas isn't at the highest possible zen and accommodation level, YET. However, so far I have gotten some awesome experiences here for the the price I pay. Each massage therapist is different which can be weird for some, but pretty cool to me. They listen to your needs. Some of them even let me know what I can do at home to continue my health and wellness needs when I'm not a the spa (besides the obvious of drinking water). Last month I had sort of a chiropractic experience, which helped me realize my left ankle is pretty bad and needs to be flexed and massaged more often lol. I have not encountered a lack of customer service, lack of respect, lack of anything that Massage Envy says they are there to offer and that's why I give them this rating.P.S.

Our waitress, while cordial, was less than attentive with us, and seemed to pay more attention to the other tables seating more customers (= more tips). As the restaurant filled with more patrons, she became even less attentive. She even had helpers to serve the food and clear the tables, so she wasn't that busy. She simply liked talking to the men at the other tables instead of waiting on us.The food was decent, not great, but hey, it's a hotel restaurant. I had a rib eye steak ($38) that was trimmed in an abundance of fat (yuck) and topped with a couple spears of burnt, dry asparagus. Presentation was nothing special either. The red velvet cake was very good, but $11? It was also so huge, the 3 of us couldn't finish it. I expect that kind of dessert at Gibson's, not here.Overall, we were disappointed with service. The food was decent, though a bit expensive for the quality delivered.

Granted, I'll admit most of my faculties were probably not up to snuff when I ate them.So when I came back to Chicago for a work conference, the first stop I made (even before the hotel!) was to the Greektown outpost of Philly's Best. It was late and midweek, but there were still plenty of folks from nurses to the gentlemen in blue - all stopping by for a cheese steak. You couldn't help but notice the Philadelphia Inquirer articles adorning the walls and the pride they had in using Amoroso rolls! \u00a0Cheese Fritters [$5.99]I started off with the cheese fritters. I can see these being decent hangover snacks, but I couldn't help but compare them to fried cheese curds. While the fried cheese fritters were decently buttery and nicely crisped, there was no stretch from the cheese and frankly, you couldn't really discern what was within. It came with a pat of marinara. But no matter - the fritters were just an attempt to satisfy my inner fat boy. I obviously came here for the cheese steak.Large Philly Cheese Steak [$13.24] Whiz & provolone, 'wit, garlic breadThese days, I have to order mine with both whiz and provolone - 'wit and on a garlic toasted roll no less. The melange of meat, cheese, and onions was just as I remembered - incredibly juicy, inundated with fried onion flavor, and well-seasoned. This isn't clean living - the taste will be on your hands 'till the next morning.The only downfall? No idea why the whiz was put underneath the steak and thus, on top of the bread. That's a huge pet peeve of mine. In what world should the roll be breaking apart from the liquid gold? Good thing I didn't ask for delivery because that would have been a bigger mess.In retrospect now, structural integrity is something that Philly definitely has in spades. But I still have to give it to Philly's Best (in Chicago!) - there's something about their combo of meat, cheese, and onions that makes for the perfect bite. Combine that with a fresh roll that holds up to the heft - it's definitely one of my top gustatory pleasures.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 9, 19]}, "35": {"description": "I've have had the cheese steak from this place a couple of times-its okay, especially on those nights when your super drunk and super hungry.

I paid for my order online and when I went to pick it up they wanted me to pay for it again. I took my phone out and showed them that the money had already been deducted from my account. The manager still said I had to pay for the order again. I refused. The food isn't that damn good to double pay for a meal.

You know how people who can't cook say they can make spaghetti with sauce well because it can't be screwed up? That's what I thought cheese pizza was in the pizza world. Apparently not.

That's why it's soggy.\" I do not expect this person answering the phone at 1:00 AM to be an extreme intellectual, but I I expect to have someone not try and bs me. I am pretty sure there is not a chemical reaction when mushroom and bread meet that causes an extreme excretion of fluids. Must be a science thing I'm just not intelligent enough to understand. I was also told that since I ordered through grub hub I had to call them to complain. After the hold. Not great. Then hung up on. Grub hub is great. Super friendly and understanding people.

I was shocked as hell to discover that the cheesesteaks here actually taste like the cheesesteaks I grew eating. I've traveled this country and have eaten so called Philly cheesesteaks in numerous cities and after the first bite I've always said, \"this ain't no damn Philly cheesesteak!!\" Thankfully, I did not have to say that after eating here. I've had relatives and friends from Philly visit me and everyone of them have stated that the cheesesteaks here taste like the ones you get back at home. Not the tourist trap places in Philly like Pat's, Geno's, Jim's or the cheesesteaks sold at Reading Terminal Market...but the places (corner stores) you find in neighborhoods all over the City of Brotherly Love.Reasons why Philly's Best cheesesteaks actually taste like the ones in Philly:1) They don't put marinara sauce on their cheesesteaks. I hate when places put marinara sauce on a cheesesteak and call it a Philly cheesesteak. Everyone from Philly knows that you don't put marinara on a regular cheesesteak...you only get marinara sauce on your steak when you order a pizza steak. 2) They use Amoroso rolls. An Amoroso roll is a must for a true Philly cheesesteak. 3) They offer the right type of cheeses: American (white), provolone and whiz.4) The founder of Philly's Best was born in Philly so he knows what a cheesesteak should taste like.I highly recommend ordering a cheesesteak from here or one of their other locations.

I came in with no expectations and really loved the experience overall. I came in on a Wednesday night with a friend and it was pretty relaxed night. No wait as we were immediately seated. Our waiter quickly came around and took our drink orders.The whole atmosphere and decor of the restaurant made it a really intimate environment which I really appreciated. We started off the night with the Saganaki after seeing other tables order the same thing. Waiter brought it out and immediately set the flames while putting it out with lemon juice minutes later. Quite an exciting experience to say the least, I almost wanted to applaud the performance. As for the dish itself? It was sooo delicious. I haven't had Saganaki before so can't compare to others but it was heavenly.For the entree i ordered one of the daily specials which was Exohiko Lamb. When they brought it out I was a little bit blown away by the portion size. I expected something pretty small but it was a good 6 inches of filo wrapped lamb which I had no complaints about. I wish I had had enough of an appetite to eat all of it in one sitting. It was quite delicious. My friend had ordered a vegetarian dish I can't recall the name off but she equally had no complaints about her food. After the very filling main course I decided I'd try and fit in some dessert as well. I ended up going with the rice pudding mostly because it was the smallest dessert that was offered. This was probably where Santorini fell a bit short. The rice pudding was pretty mediocre, even a little bit tough around the edges. Not bad, but not great.

After this, our entrees came out, and though \u00a0I cannot speak for my fiance's meal completely, I can say that she really enjoyed the Tuna steak, and it looked as if it had been prepared perfectly.

I'm not very good at deciphering flavors, but it seemed like they did something a little different with their baklava. Whatever it was, I am pretty sure I would go back just for the baklava.On top of the food being superb, our waiter was very friendly and gave us great service all night.

There's really nice murals on the wall and Greco-style decorations. We were seated right away, and had a very bubbly waitress who seemed enthusiastic. We started off with two appetizers, the saganaki ($6.95) and the broiled octopus ($12.95). Saganaki is always delicious, and I have no complaints. It was done in the traditional table side manner, and was served with bread like usual. It's one of my favorite dishes, and it was done well. But the star of our experience at Roditys was the octopus. I'm a big fan of octopus, but generally I either get it in a cold appetizer or fried. Getting it broiled in such a dish was a first for me and it was delicious. It was absolutely perfectly cooked. It was soft, more like a fish consistency and way less rubbery than I was expecting. It was simply seasoned with salt and lemon, letting the natural flavors shine. I think I ate almost all of it, and I regret nothing.We also got egg lemon soup ($3) which was delicious, with just the right amount of lemony bite to it.After that, our waitress was MIA. We waited. And waited. And waited. We think she assumed we were just getting appetizers, but we had been planning a full meal. It was a good half an hour later before she finally came back and was surprised when we asked for an entree. That's right, an. Instead of getting the whole nine yards of main dishes and desserts as well, I ended up filling up on octopus instead. My dad ordered gyros to split, but I opted out of ordering anything else. The gyros were really well seasoned and well cooked, and it was a pretty generous portion. Had I not filled up, I could have eaten a lot of it.We ended up going to Artopolis for dessert.I'd definitely come back here, because I think one flaky waitress isn't enough to ruin the pleasant atmosphere and delicious food.

Behind that there is a display of all of their fresh breads. I have yet to have anything bad here. Most recently, we loaded up on baklava, chocolate-raspberry mousse, lemon tarts, and cheesecakes. The chocolate-raspberry treats were delicious. They're covered in ganache and are so rich, you almost think you can't finish a piece. Then, of course, you do. The lemon tarts I think are my favorite. They are just the right amount of both sweet and tart, the filling is thick without being too much. The crust is super crunchy and really sweet, which is a nice contrast to the tart lemon curd. The cheesecake... Well I never got to try that because my dad ate all of it. I think that's a good sign. The baklava is textbook and delicious, with heavy doses of honey and nuts with flaky pastry. I make a point now to come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood, and it's given me a reason to venture up to Greektown more often. I'd definitely recommend it.

I've dined here with friends for lunch, great soups, salads and specialty sandwiches. They're not big on many entrees, however you can put together a tasty meal, think small plates, mix and match stuff. Their traditional soup on the menu is lemon chicken with rice, is delicious and the bowl will fill you up, it's bigger than it looks. All I can think of after getting a third of the way through it was, \"am I still eating soup?\" The cafe part, you can sit at the cafe/wine bar and just do that in lieu of a table, or linger and have something from their bakery case. If that doesn't work the bakery case has a register so you can do a take out. You can also order whole cakes or other goodies.

In the bathroom, there are two urinals, a sink, and a stall. Peering in the bathroom stall, it was dingy, but what you expect for a dive? The door look somewhat securely so no risk of someone walking in on you while your dropping a friend off.

The store was filthy, the employees rude, the shelves perpetually understocked. The employee manning the self-checkouts would actually yell at customers. It was ugly.Then Mariano's came, and for a while, it was beautiful. The service was amazing. Everything in the store was well-stocked. There were helpful employees everywhere you turned. It was actually a joy to go shopping. Then a year went by, and at some point, once Mariano's had all the customers (and Dominick's had long closed by then), they decided that they didn't give a damn about any of the things they had built their reputation on. The counters went from being fully manned to having to wait forever for someone to (half heartedly) help you. The shelves began to run out of stock (and since Mariano's diligently fronts its shelves every day, weeks could go by before someone would notice a particular variety was out of stock). You've heard the old saying \"judge someone by how he treats the waitress?\" I judge a store by its service counter. For me, this was mostly the deli area. When I first came to Mariano's, there were several helpful, knowledgeable people behind that counter. If you came really early, you were helped by Eugene, who always got the order right, stacked it neatly, etc. Everyone else gave quality service, too.Those people are long gone. There are always - ALWAYS - more people in the back room (Mariano's apparently does a big catering business). On three of my recent visits, the employees apparently didn't understand that you actually have to peel the plastic back on the item you're cutting. Mmmmm, cheese with plastic chunks! That's when and if help is available. I've been walking out lately, because 15 to 20 minute waits for help (at times that are NOT during the busy lunch hour) just seem ludicrous. So essentially, the crap experience that was Dominick's has just moved across the street. The honeymoon's over, Mariano's.

The huge parking lot for the place is 90% cabs, which to me is a good sign, as it tends to mean value and some type of flavor.The door looked somewhat like a non-traditional restaurant. Couldnt explain why. But I stepped in, and the first thing I noticed was the hollowness. PLace had very high celings, and somewhat cavernous. The cooking area was off toward the back, and the eating area was to the left and front. a stairway going down to a basement was in the middle of the room. This place is very hole-in-the-wall-ish, and is exactly the type of place I like. And no windows.A lady with a burka was at the counter, and asked if there was a menu. She tells me \"Everything you see here is delicious\", which meant no menu, and no published prices. I *did* see a list describing entrees for $6, $8 and $12 for a full order. I suppose its somewhat of a fixed price for any items. Behind the glass warmers I sw very familiar Indian-type curry stews with chicken, lamb, and some mystery meats. There were some Indian-style samosas and those other potato or onion thingies too.The food looked Pakistani or Afghan to me, which was fine. Since I was to meet a friend for dinner later, I deicded to go light. I asked about bread, she said that they had \"good naan bread.\" I went with that, and some rice, and a samosa. Again, very Indian, but everything was Halal. Paid $6 for the meal (kinda steep, shoulda gotten a protein). The rice was somewhat cold, and tasted like it had been sitting there all day. But at least the samosa was excellent, and so was the fresh, hot naan.As I waited for my food, I turned and watched the big screen tv tuned into Al- Jazeera. Man, that channel is dpressing. So much strife in the MIddle East. I thought it was funny, however, when the news showed Momar Qaddafi of Libya, and the cab drivers eating started to laugh at him. He *did* look kinda silly, but it was just funny to see the cabbies laugh at him.I will return to try a protein dish, and give an updated report.Also, I noticed men constantly walking in and out of the basement, which kinda threw me off. I also saw a partially folded sign saying something about shoes. I was thinking the only reason I would see something like that is if there were a mosque or somthing there. I later found out that was the case. I just thought it was odd - a mosque inside of a restaurant.UPDATE: Demoted to 2 stars, after my lunch date and I were whisked away involuntarily to another room, apparently because of prayers or something. The door was rudely closed behind us after we were relocated, which was just bad social etiquette.

I come back and the lady is putting my fries in my back. I must be crazy or something but I know dam well those fries didn't cook that fast.

Then it went all down hill. None of the gyros cookers were on. There was chicken, pork, lamb and beef in there but not cooking. After we ordered, the cook cuts off 2 servings of pork, but cuts the meat so deep that all you see is raw pork. Then he puts the meat on the flat top with some liquid I only assume is oil and covers it up. At this point, my friend is disgusted since his family has owned a restaurant for their entire life and never has he seen gyros cooked on a flat top instead of a gyros cooker in a greek restaurant. It doesnt end there. At this point, he has canceled his order because he asked the cook if he cleaned that knife before cutting other food with it, since he just cut raw pork. The cooks response is that he rinses it off with water. Ok so now we are down to just my pork gyros and loukoumades. After about 5 minutes, he lifts the lid on the flat top and takes a knife to cut the huge chunks of pork. Cutting it into smaller prices will make it cook faster and all the way through so I am okay with this. However, after he was finished cutting the raw port, he takes the knife over to a hand washing sink and rinses the knife off with water, then takes a paper towel to dry the knife off. He then puts the knife back. Hmm. 5 more minutes pass and the gyros comes off the grill, they add my toppings which look fine and my gyros is done. Now onto the loukoumades. They take out a tub of what I am guessing is batter and scoop globs into one of their two fryers. The same fryers that they are making the fries and every other friend food on the menu. So they are cooking my french fried loukoumades and the lady making them takes a basket and pushes the loukoumades down under the oil. I tell her that you shouldnt do this because then they will soak up the oil. She response that they will float if she doesnt and this is the way her boss told her to cook them. Any real greek knows that loukoumades are fluffy light friend balls that float. Let me emphasis the 'LIGHT\" aspect of that. So now I am expecting my french friend oil soaked dough that she takes out of the fryer and puts a little cinnamon on and what had to be less than a tablespoon of honey. Loukoumades are supposed to be doused in honey. To top it off, she takes the hot metal tin that they are in and puts it into a PLASTIC BAG. Yes, a hot metal tin in a plastic bag. I held my tongue, paid for my food and exited the establishment.When I put home and pealed off the now melted plastic from the metal container, it reveals dry heavy fried dough balls that are more like french fried donut holes than loukoumades. I added some more honey to them to see if they got better. Nope, all it did was make them more sticky so the flavor stuck around longer. Finally, lets see about the pork gyros. Opened it up and the pita was heavy and oil soaked, but okay, I wont eat the pita, lets just eat the meat and toppings. The toppings were excellent, great flavor from the feta onions and sauce. Ate some off the smaller pieces of pork and they were fine, cooked and good. Got to the other half of the gyros (the bigger pieces) and cut them open. Yup, my fears have now been confirmed, the pork is RAW. Needless to say, I didnt finish my gyros.The atmosphere of this place is awesome. Love the idea of it, but if you are a greek restaurant, then you better get greek food right or else stick with pizza and hot wings.

She was very nice and made conversation with people at the bar. We ordered the fried squid to start which was mediocre-it was basically a watered down version of fried calamari. I asked for a drink on the menu, but they were out of one of the ingredients. For entrees, I had a pasta dish and the portion was HUGE and heavy on the garlic. My boyfriend ordered a 2 pound crab which was also mediocre. It sat on a bed of glass noodles which was incredibly oily from the crab.

We ordered $36.00 and received a $10.80 discount [Fish Fillet (me), Chili Chicken (friend), Calamari & Smoothie (both of us). I wish to thank the owner for handling the situation in a professional manner and reaching out to me and address the issue ASAP, and I really liked the service I received when I came inside (the bartender brought us water even though we said we were going to carry-out). He made sure to take care of us while we were waiting for our order. He was VERY VERY polite, good guy (long ponytail, Asian, older looking good guy).

I really hate pointing out the negatives after the Owner and the Bartender were so accommodating but I just want to be and honest reviewer ----- The food we got was VERY VERY SALTY. My friend and I stopped eating it after 3-4 pieces because the SALT just made it really really hard to eat. I tried to fight through it because $27 is still expensive for a college student and I just couldn't... I was very very sad because I hate wasting my money because I work so hard to save every dollar. We also ordered calamari and that was good. Very good, my friend said we should have just ordered three of those,. We also got a smoothie and that was delicious as well. I just don't know how our main meals turned out to be so salty! I noted another 2 star review posted a couple weeks ago with the same complaint. $15 for a Fish Filet meal you can't even eat... it would make anyone sad. However, the overall 4 stars mean something, they obviously are doing something right and maybe it's just these two meals that are like that. Anyways! The ambiance is cool (check out the pictures), laid back like a sports hang out place. There are 4 TVS hanging around (2 big ones).

If our food was eatable today, I would have definitely came here multiple times in the future with a bunch of friends to watch the games because most of us love seafood.

I wish to thank the owner for handling the situation in a professional manner and reaching out to me and address the issue ASAP, and I really liked the service I received when I came inside (the bartender brought us water even though we said we were going to carry-out). He made sure to take care of us while we were waiting for our order. He was VERY VERY polite, good guy (long ponytail, Asian, older looking good guy).

My friend and I stopped eating it after 3-4 pieces because the SALT just made it really really hard to eat. I tried to fight through it because $27 is still expensive for a college student and I just couldn't... I was very very sad because I hate wasting my money because I work so hard to save every dollar. We also ordered calamari and that was good. Very good, my friend said we should have just ordered three of those,. We also got a smoothie and that was delicious as well. I just don't know how our main meals turned out to be so salty! I noted another 2 star review posted a couple weeks ago with the same complaint. $15 for a Fish Filet meal you can't even eat... it would make anyone sad. However, the overall 4 stars mean something, they obviously are doing something right and maybe it's just these two meals that are like that. Anyways!

I decided to take my date here on a Friday night at around 8:30pm. I was planning on dining at a different greek restaurant just a block away, but figured since we were already next to it, to give it a try. We walked in, and no hostess. I was a bit taken back cause the staff walked right by us and did not engage us with a smile, or hello, someone will be right with you.. nothing. 5 minutes past by and the hostess finally showed up. She sat us right away, but it seemed as if she was drained and unhappy. We look around the room and notice that we were surrounded by mature couples in their 50's, 60's, 70's.. There was absolutely no energy or laughter inside the room. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, but lacked energy and sign of life. The waiter comes by, and takes our drink order. 2 minutes later, a second waiter comes by to take our drink order. We inform him that a different waiter took our order. He looked frazzled and confused, not to mention that he was sweating and had greasy hair. Not exactly someone that I would want as my waiter serving me my food. The first waiter was no prize winner either, but nothing we could do at that point. The staff looked underpaid, unhappy, and overworked.We ordered a glass of cabernet each. I want my wine in a wine glass and unfortunately they arrived in smaller glasses. I asked the waiter to bring us regular wine glasses, and it took him forever to find 2 wine glasses for us. We ordered the greek salad for 2 to start with and when it arrived it was a dry little sad plate for 1. Normally, I love dipping my bread into the sauce, but this time.. there was no sauce to dip in. I ordered the octopus with rice and potatoes, and my date ordered the chicken. The octopus was ok, but the rice and potatoes was a dissapointment. It's normally my favorite part of the meal.

I did not pay the full groupon amount (promo code). \u00a0It seems to me they were trying to squeeze a little extra cash out of every groupon. \u00a0I was appalled and found this practice to be unethical. \u00a0Overall, major disappoints in food and service. \u00a0I recommend never visiting this place even with coupon/deal/ etc. \u00a0We would be better off ordering less food and real wine at a better restaurant. \u00a0We would probably pay comparable prices to this \"Groupon deal\" after tax and tip.Don't go!!!", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 11, 4]}, "13": {"description": "I was excited to try this place because I heard they have great authentic Greek food.

The food returned with half of the pieces cooked and the other half still pinker than a breast cancer parade. We insisted on talking to a manager. A large, elderly man came over and asked what the problem is. We responded with showing him the cooked pieces and the raw pieces. He was shocked and said \"this is the first complaint in 47 years\". Based on the yelp reviews, that's shocking to me. In addition, he said \"do you know what a marinade is\" and \"I don't understand why some pieces are cooked and why some aren't. They were put in the microwave for the same amount of time\". For the record, yes I know what a marinade is but it's very insulting when an owner is talking down to a customer about their mistake! I think the bigger problems are that he didn't understand that some pieces are larger and take longer to cook and that a restaurant uses microwaves to cook their food.

My gf ordered the special--roasted lamb ribs--which she enjoyed. My friend ordered the Greek staple gyros but was already full from the bread and the Kalamata olives.

Once he came back everyone ordered. We sat for a while waiting for our food. When it did come out it came out in spurts (i.e. 2-3 people's food came and then a few minutes later 2-3 more plates came). My boyfriend and I were one of the first people to receive our food. We had ordered a chicken dish which was supposed to have vegetables on the side and a vegetarian macaroni dish. The chicken dish came out with rice pilaf instead of vegetables and both dishes were lukewarm at best. Both dishes tasted awful due to the temperature and must have been sitting in \"the window\" without being kept heated while they waited for other food to be ready. When the waiter came (he did not bring any of the food) I caught his attention and told him both dishes were cold and asked if we could have them heated up. Instead of apologizing the waiter looked at us and said, \"really? Both dishes?\" Yes, we want both dishes taken back and heated up. I then repeated what I had said, that both dishes were cold and seemed to have been sitting around for a while. When I said this he rolled his eyes at me, said okay, and walked away...without taking our food. He went to the table behind us and spoke with them for a few minutes and then came back to take our plates. He brought them back (the same food we had had) with vegetables instead of rice for the chicken dish several minutes later. The food was the appropriate temperature this time. The vegetarian macaroni dish was okay. Nothing to write home about. The chicken dish which was stuffed with feta and spinach was also okay but again, nothing I would order again or go out of my way to have. When the bill came we were charged full price for everything. I was not the person paying the bill so I could not complain but had I been paying I would have asked to speak with a manager.

Spaganaki, and Fried Zucchini with Skordalia. It was our first time trying Spaganaki, so we didnt know what to expect. We didnt like it. It was VERY oily. I put it on my cold bread though & it tasted alot better! \u00a0I have to say, the zucchini was TO DIE FOR. Thats the only reason I am giving the restarant 1 1/2 stars. 25 mins later the waiter comes, and asks if were ready for our entree. I order the Chicken Spanaki (Chicken Breast stuffed with Spinach & Feta & rice on the side), my boyfriend ordered a good ol fashion Gyro. TEN MINUTES. NOT KIDDING, TEN MINUTES later our food came. Im sorry, but the only thing I could think was \"I am not eating that, because A: its either still raw inside, or B: its old & was cooked earlier.\" WHAT DO YOU KNOW, dry as all hell, rice was cold on top, and there was this overbarring taste of dill & lemon. It was just WAY to much. My boyfriends Cucumber sauce might as well been dill sauce. We couldnt eat it. We were so disappointed. We asked for the check and left.

Then, a couple of years ago, I decided to try some of the other restaurants on Halsted. And while each has its own merits, Greek Islands is still my favorite. \u00a0I thiink one of the best parts of any Greek meal is the sesame bread and olive oil. Their bread always tastes like it just came out of the oven, and the olive oil is perfect for dipping. Recommended bread spreads are the Tzatziki (cucumber, yogurt and garlic), and the Melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant).Since I've never been successful at cooking lamb, I often order it out. My favorite dish is their roast loin of lamb, always tender and with a lot of flavor. I always ask them to substitute the potato with Greek green beans, sauteed with olive oil, tomatoes and amazing seasonings. (The green beans aren't on the menu, but are usually available.)Since I've also never mastered the skill of cooking octopus, another of my favorites is their grilled marinated octopus. Many restaurants overcook this dish, which makes it tough, but Greek Islands always gets it right.Lots of other pluses, including free valet parking, a good selection of Greek wines, and good service. This restaurant can get packed on weekends and when there's a big convention in town, so eat early or be prepared to wait in their large bar area.I like to split a dessert to have with coffee at the end of a meal. If there's one area where Greek Islands could improve, it's desserts. (Why do most Greek restaurants offer the same boring desserts?)

And when you open them, the decor and waitstaff will only help your imagination along!This place is CROWDED and for good reason, but the staff and managers seem to have an awesome system that files people in and out in no time, aka: there is virtually no wait for a table, regardless of the number in your party. There was three of us and immediately we were directed to our table, that overlooked the kitchen... Now for the tasty details! Here's what we ordered:- Eggplant Dip: simple yet tasty as hell thanks to the garlic and the creamy texture - Flaming Cheese: smelled like what heaven must smell like, which means it obviously tasted good too.- Grilled Octopus: my favorite thing ever, grilled octopus is chewy, yet sweet, yet meaty, and just hands down delicious!- Grilled Squid: I actually think I liked this dish better than the octopus as it was a bit crispier (without being fried) and the tentacles were PERFECTLY COOKED!- Whole Roasted Seabass: go big or go home, so I went big and got the whole Seabass, bones and all, and pretty much sucked every morsel of meat off that sucker. Had to get my money's worth, not like it was all that hard considering they give you a WHOLE FISH for $20.95!- Two sides of Vegetables: I don't like potatoes and our server listened to me and made sure to serve me up two sides that had minimal potatoes in them. These stewed veggies kicked some serious ass! Reminded me of my dad's cooking!- Moussaka: I know my friend LOVES THIS... Because even though she was pretty full when the main event arrived, she still tried her best to finish it, alas: she did get a doggy bag so she could make her co-workers JEALOUS at lunch the next day!- Salad with Gyro Meat: my friend who got this really wishes she didn't load up on McDonalds right before coming to dinner! The meat was flavorful but not dripping in fat. Lent a wonderful flavor to the salad greens. - Salad with Cheese: this went down the hatch in five seconds. Clearly a winner.

Being a Texan, the only thing I have a hard time with is some items not coming with sides and having to add those separate as I'm used to giant portions. But even though they are pricey the food is certainly worth it and not once have I left still hungry. Recently I tried their vegetarian plate fell in love. It had the biggest beans I had ever seen (Lima?), greens, and stewed vegetables all cooked to perfection in a delicious blend of oil and spices. My husband got the lamb chops and I had to stop him from literally licking his plate.

If you're in the area, I think it's worth it to even just order dessert ($6 for baklava) for the free valet parking! I was seated immediately upon entering on a Monday night around 6PM.I ordered the spanikopita to start. The waiter asked, \"You mean the spinach pie?\" I nodded, but thought this was strange. I've been to Greece and spent a month there. I know I called it the right name! The spanikopita arrived, but did not come in phyllo triangles. Instead, it was more like a piece of a spinach casserole. It was good, but not the best. Instead of cheese cubes, I would've preferred the filling to be more of a combination of cheese sauce and spinach, not just spinach.I also ordered the broiled octopus with rice and potatoes. The octopus was perfectly cooked (not rubbery) and definitely had those Greek flavors of lemon and olive oil. It was yummy! I could not eat all of it. I wish there had been more rice (you get half of a bread plate's worth, so not much). The potato was the best part. I was a bit dubious at first because the potato arrived, smothered in a tomato sauce, but it was phenomenal. I am baffled as to how the depth of flavor is achieved. Roasted tomatoes? Lots of garlic? It was absolutely delicious, and I wish there had been more.Service was decent. The waiter kept asking me every five minutes if I \"was happy,\" and I wanted at some point to say that I'd be happy if I won the lottery. I gave three stars for the spanikopita.

Seeing that it was walking distance from me, of course it'd be a no-brainer that we come. The first time we came, we did it family style, which comes with appetizers, gyros, some main dishes, and dessert. The following dinner dates have been a la carte with both food and wine, and there has yet to be a time where I didn't enjoy my experience.One thing's for sure, you have to order these two appetizers: saganaki (flaming cheese) and taramosalata (roe spread). If I had just these two on my plate, I'd be good for the rest of the evening. They put on a quick show for you before presenting the cheese, and the roe spread on Bruschetta is to die for.As for the mains, I highly recommend a plate of their gyros, which taste better and less oily as those chain gyro shops around the corner. Anything with lamb here is another must! The way they braise their lamb meats and stew it is phenomenal. Lastly, I recently had their sea bass, which was incredible! A nice hint of citrus over juicy bass made this the perfect dinner.Service here has always been friendly and fun, as well as the ambiance. They have a large open patio that is perfect for summertime.It's hard for me to try other restaurants in Greek Town because this place is so great.

Greek Islands is like so many other Greek restaurants I went to in the fact that it is set up banquet style (think Reza's) with large rooms, opulent over the top Greek statues, white-wash walls (as if all of Greece was Santorini), with too many dining rooms to count. Greek Islands is a Greek restaurant that tries to be a Greek restaurant. During my travels in Greece I never once encountered a restaurant like Greek Islands, and all of my favorite meals in the country were unassuming small places that just made good food with fresh ingredients. Our group elected to get the fixed prices menu, which makes sense since it works well in large groups and we got an assortment of food. First off, no pita bread, which is a bummer. But instead of providing other types of Greek bread (like Psomi), you just get generic bland sesame bread, which makes dipping less excited. The gyro meat with tzaziki and garlic sauce was fine, but nothing one hasn't had before if they've had Greek food. The flaming cheese was tasty, the potatoes and rice were ok, the lamb and chicken were overdone, and the dessert was average. On top of that the \"Greek\" salad came with lettuce and no anchovies. The anchovies are understandable as not many Americans enjoy anchovies, but I always judge a Greek restaurant by their salad. There's nothing quite like a true Greek salad with a heaping bowl of chopped cucumbers, red and green peppers, vinaigrette, olives, and delicious salty blocks of feta cheese. No lettuce need apply for my Greek salad, thanks.

I was blown away with the \"grocery store\". I used quotes because I don't feel like it really is a grocery store. Sure, you can buy groceries here, but it's so much more. There's also a lounge with gelato, wine, and beer, a sushi bar, which I'm reviewing today, Oyster bar, wine bar, grilling station, and other stations that sell already cooked food.The sushi bar is one of the first things that is seen when you go upstairs. The bar usually has a few people sitting there already, but when I was there, it was completely empty. Unlike some of the reviews I've read about this place, it was quite tidy and the service wasn't bad. Being from California, I'm very particular about my raw fish. The wasabi, the rice, the freshness of the fish, and more. I haven't actually eaten sushi in Chicago yet, so I was kind of looking forward to this place, but not exactly bringing my expectations as high as my usual spots in California.Looking at the menu, Oki Sushi is mostly a roll place with few pieces of sushi available. I ordered the Godzilla Maki roll for $14, cause the picture made it look pretty good, as well as a Sushi Combo for $10. The Godzilla Maki consisted of 10 pieces of \"tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, tobiko, chili sauce, scallions, sesame seeds, covered with tempura crumbs, wasabi mayo and sweet soy sauce\". Seeing as I was the only customer, the roll came out super fast, and to my surprise, it was actually really good. The Godzilla was a good mix of flavors and textures. However, it wasn't what I was really looking forward to. What I wanted most was the sushi. For those who aren't familiar, sushi is the ball of rice with a topping of raw fish, sashimi are cuts of raw fish, and rolls are... Well, things rolled up in rice/seaweed/whatever they want to roll it up with.Anyways. My sushi combo. Was super disappointing. It came with 8 pieces of bland California rolls and 3 pieces of sushi. 1 Salmon, 1 Tuna, and 1 Yellowtail. The presentation was nice. The 3 pieces of fish in alternating color with the 8 California rolls in a curved display above it. The taste however, was lacking. My favorite fish, the salmon, was not fatty at all, the tuna looked like it was falling apart, and the yellowtail felt kind of mushy. None of them tasted fresh. I really hope my stomach doesn't hurt tonight. The rice was bland and mushy and there weren't any wasabi in any of them. There was a fair amount of pickled ginger and wasabi given with the plate so I had to add the wasabi in myself. On the upside, the wasabi and pickled ginger was pretty good. I'm usually not the biggest fan of pickled ginger, but when they make it a bit sweeter, I can eat a bunch of it, which I did. The wasabi's texture was a good consistency and it wasn't too... I don't know the English word for it, but it didn't burn your nose too bad.Overall, like its name, it was just Oki. The Godzilla Maki was 5 to 10 times better than their Sushi Combo. For charging the same prices as outside places, I expected them to do MUCH better than this. BUT! If you want some fast rolls to go, order it from them instead of grabbing it from the to-go fridge.

The gyro sandwich combo for $8.15. Which is a pretty good deal seeing how just the gyro sandwich was $7.15, which makes the drink and fries only a dollar! The guy at the counter was pretty fun and friendly when I ordered.I've never been a big fan of Greek food, mostly cause I really don't come across it or when I do, I don't eat it, but from what I could tell, it was a lot of meat on a pita, topped with raw onions, tomatoes, and this yogurt tasting white sauce. I believe the meat was made by taking a bunch of ground meat, sticking it on a stick, and roasting it. Then, they cut the outside layers off in thin strips.My food came out pretty fast and wow. It was big. The gyro was incredibly oily and the meat was a bit over salted, but good nonetheless. The yogurt sauce made things milder but I would have preferred a bit more in my gyro. I enjoyed eating the gyro, but it wasn't great. I felt like I was just trying to finish the food in front of me instead of savoring each and every bite. The fries were slightly crispy and fluffy, but they weren't salted. They could've been in the fryer for a while longer or maybe even double fry them. The amount Mr. Greek gave weren't a joke either.

The event hit capacity.But darn it, I still wanted to go out on Thursday evening, and since I had mentioned in the commentary thread for the beer garden that Spectrum, just down (or up, depending on your vista) Halsted Street was *_a 4:00 am bar_*; I concocted a parallel non-event event.Spectrum is *another* bar with which I am familiar with on a professional level. But it was not nearly as satisfying at Arno's Place. However, that was not its fault. Some of you may have known that in the span of August 1994 to April 1996, I was keenly involved with the faltering Chicago POWER indoor soccer franchise. There are World-Wide Web pages in which *I* take the blame for our catastrophic back-to-back 6-34 seasons. [In actuality, the National Professional Soccer League was running the financial aspects of the franchise. I do not have to tell you that it was squeezing pennies.] After the serious fiasco of 1994-95, in which the Rosemont Horizon gave us the cold shoulder in favor of its *new* minor league ice hockey team (We wound up playing \"home\" games in Rockford.), the League finally got the memo that we would be better off playing at a facility *in Chicago*. For 1995-96, it moved the bulk of our home games to the U.I.C. Pavilion. We actually had better players and some coherence in the front office that season - but the League made one crucial mistake when it decided to extrude me from doing any work for it in mid-October 1995. I had some feelers out for advertisers and sponsors for the team that season, and was in conversation with Goose Island Brwg. Co. to sponsor the green jerseys for Saint Patrick's Day for our final Chicago home game of the season [on Sunday, 17 March]. The extrusion lasted all of seven weeks. A person the League hired and was paying to be the media relations officer put out media releases with _inaccurate_ information. The feedback from other teams' media officers was swift and brutal. He quit around Thanksgiving Day (even before our Chicago home opener). I more-or-less resumed coordinating our media releases for free. [I was willing to invest in the franchise in June 1995. I didn't need its money.]The Spectrum Bar & Grill became the venue for our post-game parties. I liked its location. If I drove to the Pavilion, I learned where I could park on the nearby streets to go to post-game. I liked that you could get something good to eat just about everywhere (not necessarily at Spectrum). Lastly, Spectrum's beer prices were cheap.As it turned out, we only won *one* game in Chicago that season. Three of our \"home\" victories were in New Haven, CT.; and we won road games in Baltimore, MD., & Wichita, KS. [Baltimore _fired_ their head coach three days after they lost the home game to us.]The only game we won in Chicago was on Sunday, 17 March! But my extrusion meant that Goose Island had allocated its spring promotional budget by the time I got back in. John Hall offered, \"Let us know for next year.\"Spectrum hasn't changed much since 1996. It's definitely a dive bar. But it's a quality one. I started out here with one glass of Heineken on draft ($3.50). Then I switched to a beer I nearly never have, Miller Genuine Draft on draft (Turn Turn off off that that echo echo.) ($2.50). Spectrum doesn't have Old Style or Pabst Blue Ribbon. It *does* have some interesting eastern European beers in bottles if you want to go that route. There is a digital juke box, but it's usually off in favor of XM Satellite Radio. (I can't get the hang of those. I like to learn what the juke box has, scrawl down some selections, go back to my bar stool, and marshall my playlist.) It has DirecTV dbs, but it does not subscribe to any sports packages.I had a nice time this Thursday, even though I didn't notice anyone from Pegasus visiting here afterward. [I made my cameo appearance on the rooftop at Pegasus telling all the Yelpers there that I was going over to Spectrum.]The rating was pushed up to four stars due to when the N.B.A. draft finished, and the women's basketball game finally ended on espn2 [it went triple overtime]; someone erroneously turned off the one television set which then showed the Thursday night Major League Soccer game on espn2. I asked my bartender if it could please turn the soccer game back on. The manager of the venue learned of my query, and he put the soccer game on not just that television set, but two others. Thirty minutes later, somebody made fresh (free) popcorn.[Turning it back on paid off as well. SportsCenter premiered on espn2 due to the N.B.A. draft, and when that ended, that afternoon's Euro 2008 semi-final was reshown.] I left here at 11:20 pm.Transit options: Take the Blue Line \"L\" to UIC / Halsted.

There are places out south that I can go to get the same quality of food for seven dollars a plate, but with more flavor. However these plates cost an astronomical 20 bucks each. My husband and I also got mixed drinks, which were also horrible. My husband's drink was very watery, and mine had way too much thyme syrup. I only drank about a quarter of it. How horrible! It's Christmas Eve! I want a buzz not a sugar rush. * insert sad face* We also had the meatball appetizer, which tasted more like an authentic Greek dish so if anything get that, even though that was only just okay as well.

I just called and I was told the manager would be in after 8:00pm - this was all after repeating what transpired three times.

Answer as of today: 21,160With that many stores, your processes and products will be pretty standard so like always - let's focus on the people and place (building).The layout is fairly spacious and accommodates good workspace and hangouts for those \"work from home\" days. There's also a small corner near the front of the shop with a few arm chairs and mini ottomans for a more intimate and relaxed environment. The music level varies from time to time but overall is usually at a good level. |Speaking of \"working from home\"| Let's address the one thing that's becoming almost as crucial as air - WiFi. The connection is fairly reliable here but whether or not it'll meet your capacity (bandwidth) \u00a0needs is a whole different story. I spent a ~4 hours here during one visit and was not able to pull data from an enterprise-size database as I experienced heavy delays retrieving results from fairly short queries. Another thing to note is that while the sign says the WiFi is supported by Google it is in fact supported by AT&T still - which isn't the biggest show stopper but I do experience slower speeds using a device on a non-AT&T network than I do using a device on AT&T when connected to this locations WiFi. I suppose that's to be expected and there's tons of variables that could cause this but its something to highlight and consider. All in all, if you're only looking to do web/app browsing and email, you'll be fine but anything more than that and you may want to take that into consideration.|Do you really need a car in Chicago|Something I haven't really had to consider until moving to Chicago is - parking. Not every place has free parking, especially downtown and when it does its for a reasonable limited time (approx 2 hours) before you need to pay some type of parking charge. While this location does have a parking lot supporting it, the parking lot is shared with a bank and a small retail strip. Some parking spots are marked for \"Bank Customers Only\", however the times I may or may not have parked there were non issues for me in the morning and afternoon (quick trips running in and out btw). All in all (and this is something I assume Starbucks isn't responsible for) the parking lot should be better labeled. In the end, you're in Chicago though so enjoy your walk (maybe not in this current weather) or take advantage of the CTA bus stops located less than a block away.|Baristas make the world go round|The staff here is awesome, friendly and quick to learn your order, which is always appreciated it. They're able to keep the line moving while keeping the ordering process personable and enjoyable. I have to say that while personalities differ from city to city, the staff at this location balances a nice \"Chicago feel\" w/the Starbucks experience. All in all, this location is a winner.

Severely lacking on cheese, to the point of maybe 40% of the pizza being a bald patch under the toppings.Topperstix: Sufficient, a bit bland, no seasoning or anything. Also lacking on the cheese :(Sauces: We tried Chipotle Ranch and Parmesan Garlic. The CR was very good, heavy smoke flavor when first opened but after that it was a good amount. The PG was very flavorful, but way too salty. Felt like the ratio of parmesan to garlic wasn't very balanced.Leftovers: Tasted pretty much the same after going back in the oven, which is more than you can say about a lot of pizza places.All in all, not too bad and I'd like to try some of their other house pizzas.

I am currently waiting, in the store, for a pizza we ordered to be delivered but Eri refused to deliver (well within the delivery zone) unless we paid for this pizza in store. We show up, and have to wait another 30 minutes?! This guy is the worst. If the price wasn't decent and the location convenient we would NEVER order from here. How many complaints about the same incompetent person does it take before a company realizes they've made a mistake by hiring this guy.

I liked the 50/50 combo of ranch and buffalo sauce. The chicken was decent, nothing to write home about. Severely lacking on cheese, to the point of maybe 40% of the pizza being a bald patch under the toppings.Topperstix: Sufficient, a bit bland, no seasoning or anything. Also lacking on the cheese :(Sauces: We tried Chipotle Ranch and Parmesan Garlic. The CR was very good, heavy smoke flavor when first opened but after that it was a good amount. The PG was very flavorful, but way too salty. Felt like the ratio of parmesan to garlic wasn't very balanced.Leftovers: Tasted pretty much the same after going back in the oven, which is more than you can say about a lot of pizza places.All in all, not too bad and I'd like to try some of their other house pizzas.
