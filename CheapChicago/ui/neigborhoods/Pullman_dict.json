I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had, and I had a chance to chat a bit with the owner and her daughter. The menu has the assortment of desserts and sandwiches you've come to know and love in a cafe at a reasonable cost. I ordered a toasted bagel and cream cheese, mmm.Their unlimited coffee was cafe quality, nice and fresh. \u00a0They told me they've been open for about two months so far. \u00a0I'm sure in time, this will become the go-to place in the area, and not just on weekend mornings. If i had one wish for them, I would hope that they could open a couple of hours earlier, and have the support of the community to make it worth their while. \u00a0The area McDonalds needs some early morning competition for people who want to have a more relaxing way to start the day.

I was excited to check out this new caf\u00e8 in my old stomping grounds. I entered the caf\u00e8 greeted everyone with a hello to receive nothing in return. Whelp, I chalked that up to midday blues. I sat down, pulled out my laptop and began working. I thought the caf\u00e9 environment welcomed a working atmosphere, needless to say I was wrong. About 10 minutes later, I was given the menu and was told if I wanted to place an order, go to the counter. I glanced over the menu nothing grabbed my attention except the $10 min. for credit cards. I was torn because I only wanted tea and a dessert, which didn't quite equal $10. About 30 minutes later, I heard a camera snap and coincidently one of the employees was directly across from me. I didn't know if it she was taking a picture of me or of something random. However, how things unfolded it was obvious she took a picture of me. \u00a0The same employee approached me, and rudely asked was I going to order something. I said well, I am still uncertain but you can take the menu. I assumed she needed the menu for the customer who had just entered-whom btw she greeted nicely and warmly. Nope! She put the menu back in the holder. I was in shock that I was being treated like this!The icing on the cake! The owner approached me, which I was confused about because I was under the impression the caf\u00e9 was owned by a gentleman. \u00a0Anyhoo, she introduced herself and asked was I was going to purchase something. I was completely flabbergasted at this point! I said if I was, I am not anymore! She asked me to LEAVE! She said is the expectation for me to purchase something, and I said I had every intention when I entered to place an order. However, your staff treated me poorly and I was on the fence if I wanted to patronize the business. She told me if I was going to sit there with my laptop and use her wifi (which I used my hotspot) I could go to McDonalds! She went on to say, this is a restaurant not a library, it is at her discretion how she wants to handle her policies regarding orders and credit cards fees. She went on to say I was being rude by explaining my experience and telling her I've never been treated like this. She told me her staff is family as if that made them exempt from being rude to a customer! Oh and I must not be from the area. I made it clear I work in the hospitality industry and by no means how I've been treated equates to customer service. She replied, she is sorry I feel that way! She humored me and said when I return I would have to purchase something after asking me to leave again! I am terribly disappointed, and it is unsettling how the owner handled the situation because her employees/family will think it is ok. As a golden nugget of advice for them, a purchasing policy means nothing to the customer if he or she is not aware. They may want to implement that along with a greeting policy for employees. I wish them luck, and am glad my intuition was indecisive.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 11, 3]}, "9": {"description": "Nice, friendly atmosphere and Cafe du Monde coffee!

I was just expecting a standard fare sandwich but honestly, it was delicious! \u00a0The only unfortunate thing was somehow my order was not put in and it took some time before they (and I) realized that there was a problem. The gentleman was extremely apologetic and gave me an order of bread pudding on the house. I wasn't planning on eating dessert (trying to diet) but once it was in front of me, I couldn't resist. Ok, I could have taken it to my mom... Anyway, it was homemade and really good! All of the desserts are homemade and are very popular, according to the regulars that came in.

I take it back to the store and explain the mixup, and the employees in the Customer Service department seemed weary and nonchalant about this huge error. One casually calls back to the electronics department to see if there was an iPad 2 in stock.Meanwhile, a 2nd female employee takes my receipt and decides that she's going to walk back to electronics and check on things personally. She stays gone for about 10 minutes, walks back to the cust svc area w/my receipt still in hand and than goes back for another 10-15 minutes. I decide to go back and see whats going on (I was simply going to ask if I could go to another WalMart if the iPad was not in stock), and she's lounging against the counter casually talking to (an obviously busy) electronics employee. I ask her what's happening and she barely looks at me, stating that she's trying to find out if they have an iPad, and tosses out that \"its busy\". Turns out they DO have the device, but what happens next is pretty amazing, even for our neighborhood. She gets the iPad in her hand turns around without a word to me and heads BACK up to the Customer Service area along with the Merchandise supervisor and they are chatting with each other while, I, the customer (remember me?) trails behind them wondering how I've managed to stay in this store for 40 minutes and how on earth 20 of them were spent finding out if there was an iPad 2 on deck for an exchange.Back in the cust svc area, a couple of managers are consulted and the iPad Mini is taken OUT of the box in front of me, serial numbers are checked and my id and receipt are thoroughly audited, ONLY then does the merchandise supervisor present me with the iPad 2 and says \"I apologize\". Unreal. I explained to them that they were not doing me any favors and stated that I expected basic courtesy \u00a0since I'm the one who paid $400 for a device that an employee walks through the store with, thoroughly ignoring me like I'm a pesky fly or necessary evil she has to deal with. Bottom line: These employees need to be trained in common, basic, customer service. Just because Walmart is large, and successful, does not excuse this kind of behavior...

I do give them props for the cleanliness of the store since I don't see that in many Wal Marts where the store and bathrooms arent clean.
