Done.I would not waste my calories on this again. The restaurant was run down. I'm okay with hole in the wall type restaurants, but not when they are dirty and overall unfriendly. I was starving so asked for breadsticks while waiting for our pizza, unfortunately they never came. By the time the pizza arrived, I didn't care. The pieces of sausage were gigantic to the point that it completely took over the entire pizza. It was greasy and at times, almost inedible. We ended up taking over half of it with us and pitching it the following day.Extremely disappointing for Chicago, land of pizza.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 5, 28]}, "56": {"description": "Late night, looking for some serious south side pizza?

Pizza night. We have had pizza from Phil's a few times but each time had been delivery. It was a cool summer night out so we decided we would pick it up this time instead.I called in my order and spoke to a man on the phone. The time was 7:20 pm. A large special was ordered after a brief discussion. 30 minutes, he said. No, wait. He changed his mind. Better make it 40 minutes. I said, no problem.I showed up at 8:10ish pm and made my way to the counter. There was one family of 4 having their dinner at a table and 3 other customers waiting for their take-out/pick-up order. The family of 4 will come into play later.Behind the counter was a young Hispanic with her hair tied back in a pony tail. She looked busy as she called out an order for someone to come pick up. She asked me my name and I responded. \"Its not ready.\" she said and she turned away before I could even ask her how much longer it would take. She retreated into the kitchen where it looked like there was about 4 or 5 people making pizzas frantically. I decided not to wait for her to return and grabbed a seat in the diner. Customer after customer walked in and asked about their take-out and every response from the woman was \"It's not ready\". And each time, she would turn away as quickly as she could to retreat to the kitchen.Now, I've worked in a restaurant before. I understand that a kitchen can get backed up and things can fall apart pretty quickly. The woman didn't handle the customers very well but at this point, I just thought she was ill-trained and maybe a little rude. This would change later.After waiting for about 15 minutes, I decided to face the rude woman behind the counter. I walked up and waited for her to come back and asked her how long it would take. She asked for my name again and before my lips could even finish forming the last syllable, she responded.\"It's not ready.\"Here's where the family of 4 comes in. The father behind me must have raised his hand to signal for her because at this point she leaned around me and asked him what he needed. Apparently, he wanted another 2 liter of Pepsi because she went to go get it for him. I waited.\"I understand its not ready, but how much longer will it be?\"With an irritated huff, she went into the kitchen and looked on their table of order slips. Without even turning to face me, she shouted \"5 minutes\". Rude? What's worst than rude? Whatever it is, she's riding that border like a pro at this point. At this point, the dining room has 8 other customers waiting. I went back to my game of 2048 on my phone and just waited. At 8:40 pm, I finally heard my name called. Here's where the story actually gets uglier.There was an elderly woman there who had been waiting before I even arrived. She got up and very irately began to complain how people who arrived after her were getting their food before her. Rightly so. The young woman with the pony tail responded by saying her food wasn't ready and that phone orders were at 40 minutes. Remember, I got there at 8:10 pm and it was now 8:40 pm. This poor woman had to have been waiting for more than 40 minutes in that waiting room now. At this point, the elderly woman was visibly angry because she thinks she's being mistreated. In response, the woman with the pony tail laughs. Yah. She laughs. I was stunned. I look into the kitchen to see if anybody there was \"Phil\" or a manager or something had seen this. The closest man to the front was at the pizza oven. He had heard. And he was also laughing.Phil's Pizza is good. It is. But the employees/managers/owner there aren't rude. No, this isn't rudeness. It's contempt. They believe that they can laugh in an elderly woman's face because they're Phil's Pizza. They are hurtful and they are dishonorable. At some point, you have to decide whether good pizza is worth supporting a business that would hurt another person just because they can.We have leftovers. I think I'm just going to throw it away.

We tried looking on our own, but they have so many different plants indoors and outdoors. Half of them didn't even seem to be labeled. We looked around for an employee to help us, but couldn't find one. I asked the lady at the register for help or if there was anyone else working in the garden center who could help us. She understandibly could not leave the register, but offered to call someone out. So I waited around for someone to come and help me. This dude was so rude and didn't seem to care at all. I tried explaining and showing pictures of the plants we needed and he said \"no, sorry. I don't know anything about plants\". Like, really? You work in the garden center and you don't know anything about plants? He claimed that the ONLY employees who knew anything about plants \"called off\". Yeah, ok. We finally found one of the plants we needed and I saw a different employee wandering around the garden center and asked him for help. He did his very best to help us find the last plant we needed, but could not find it. We ended up getting a similar plant instead. As a last resort, I went to the customer service desk to ask her if she could find out if they even carry the plant we were looking for and if they had it in stock. She looked on her computer and told me that this particular plant was only sold online and called the other home depot on Canal to make sure they didn't have it.

But I know better than to assume that because a joint is in the hood it equals bad food. There just might be some shady shit going on around you. I was greeted by a woman that was really nice and informed me that I had a 10-15min wait ahead of me because she had to cook the food. This made me happy. This implied the food was going to be prepared while I waited instead of being microwaved. The food: I ordered a 1/4 of white meat chicken, mild sauce, fries, slaw and bread. It had a nice smoky tabasco scent to it. The chicken was juicy, the sauce was slightly sweet and slightly had a kick to it. It was addicting. The sauce dripped on to the bread and fries and made what was just regular fries and regular white bread into something tasty. The slaw was little and great.

There are over 2 dozens per-slice cakes as well, if you are just looking to try different flavors (oooh the flaaaaan!)After I chose my bday cake, I had the time to really look around & take in the store. \u00a0Woah. Now that's a lot of pastries all in 1 spot! The moment you walk in the store, you can pick up round metal pans + tongs to make your selection. They had at least 3-4 rows of breads, empanadas, cookies, churros, pound-cakes, torta breads and much much more! \u00a0Not everything was decked out in sugar though, you can buy breads for daily meals to be used in tortas or sandwiches, and the empanadas had fresh, jam-like fruit fillings. Not to mention all the exotic flavors you can get (Mango/Pineapple/Guava anyone?)I slowly made my round and picked up plenty of treats for the next week (remember, I only came in to get a Tres Leches cake). At the counter, the cashiers were super friendly and chatted about their favorite pastries in the store! The cake was wrapped & ready to go!At the birthday party, everyone's eyes were glued to my Tres Leches en Pina Colada cake... it was a beauty ;) \u00a0The ladies from La Baguette had threw in some candles, a slicing knife & written the birthday boy's name + \"Feliz Cumpleanos\" on the cake! \u00a0The cake was juicy & moist from the tres leches cream, and just enough whipped cream on top!

So, great reviews are totally fitting for this place where lunch can run you 12 m'f'n bucks. Where the hell can you get non highly processed home made coffee, sandwiches, and desserts that don't cost your left gonad? And on the South Side? Hmmm.... no brainer: this place.Being a native of the South Side I have resented the Yelp-er and usual transplant belief that anything of cultural value and good taste resides on the North Side. This place is an oasis amongst fast food joints (i.e. DD and MCD's are a block away) on the fringe of the old stockyard industrial sector where the local lardery emits some quite nasty fumes on hot summer days (yeah, that sucks, Back of the Yards). Parking is available on the side of the building on a gravel lot -- probably waiting for some other development to swipe it. There's also Ashland, but that is limited.Place is family run. The service is quite friendly and helpful. The coffee is great. Espresso and cafe con leche for under $2? Hook me up please. I got wired and jittery on just little cup of the former. Great taste, bitter and strong. The only thing is that speed is an issue. If you're in an absolute rush it might help to call in a larger order. Drinks come fast, but the sandwiches take a few minutes. So, is that really a deal breaker? Hardly. The sandwiches are quite well seasoned and fresh. The steak is marinated and well cooked. It could be trimmed of the little globules of fat for those who have a hard time dealing with that kind of thing, but frankly if you're expecting health food you can order the veggie empanada which is pretty damn good. If you feel like you need to sneak in some Irish Creme, don't you can just bring your own bottle of anything -- It's BYOB.Enjoyed studying (they have WIFI) and sitting around this place with its great seating, not the biggest place, but it definitely deserves a shot if you're in the area and want to avoid fried crap and the high fructose corn syrup diet that is the bane of much of the South Side.Come here and give it your business so I have a good place to study and munch of goodies, dammit!", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 6, 23]}, "12": {"description": "Discovered this place through Yelp and its definitly a hidden gem in New City.

They're not home during the day, so the earliest they get to the box sitting out in the elements is 6-7 p.m. The earliest I pick up my items is late Monday night or Tuesday night. At that time, my Bitty Box (or larger if I/they need more) + extra items ON SALE every week, is the result of the best quality organic produce and food. The way these people wrap my box is one for the record books. The frozen items remain frozen and are in a separate box from the fragile fresh food. Same with the refrigerated dairy, etc. Everything ordered is carefully boxed with like items to (I'm assuming) resist contamination, keep everything at its peak of freshness and picture perfect beautiful - which it is! Every so often, a cucumber will be soft at the ends, or a tomato will be yucky or strawberries will be overripe. In that case, I email Door to Door and my account is credited immediately. Sometimes, I will receive the item that had to be tossed the next week + the credit. If there's a problem, tell customer service. I have never communicated with such a friendly staff of people who sincerely want to help and want your business. What's nice is they'll sometimes put some extra produce in your box.

As the wife of someone who has been playing guitar for well over a decade, I sometimes find myself tagging along at different shops to buy picks, cables, amps, and whatnot. Plus, music equipment is always a great gift idea for J. There are places I have liked (e.g. Sweetwater, but that is in Indiana), and places where I would rather sit in the car and wait. CME is like a dream. It is so spacious and well laid out. SO SPACIOUS. The repairs are downstairs, there is a separate place for drums, rooms for bass and acoustic guitars, and little tiny individuals rooms where you can plug in and do some wailing and not annoy everyone else. The staff don't check on you every single minute, but you know where to find them should you need assistance. Most importantly, there is comfortable seating scattered all over the place - we're talking cloth and leather seats and couches. This is fantastic. I am not a teen anymore, and would rather sit down and scan my Instagram feed, instead of fawning over anyone who can strum a few John Mayer or \"Hey There Delilah\" chords. The axes (throwing a little guitar lingo in here - who am I?!) are beautifully displayed. I actually walked around for quite some time to look at them - the vintage ones are my favorite. I also love the display of amps. Highly recommend for musicians and their significant others.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 10, 29]}, "29": {"description": "Yelp can go f*** itself, but I feel compelled to tell you that CME is honestly one of my faves.

I felt right at home as he helped me choose my first guitar, a Taylor 114e, to use and reacquaint myself for my planned lessons at Chicago School of Music with Richard. By the way, it was my instructor Richard who recommended this place to me. So, a referral from a musician/music instructor carries lots of credibility in my book.Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Drew and the rest of the staff worked as a team made up of friends - the opposite of what you might expect at a big container store made up of text crazy strangers with very different lives. In contrast, this place was made up of a \"critical mass\" of musicians, where all of the computers were Mac's and most staff were dressed in tattoos and tripster jeans - which I thought was very individualistic and cool! I could feel the passion and harmony within this temple and, of course, couldn't help but admire all of their fine heirlooms. The guitar room was my focus which felt like a bank vault stocked with precious valuables with shiny lacquered bodies (guitars of course) and a place of worship simultaneously. Let me not forget a man, part of this congregation, I noticed sitting in the middle with his sunglasses on and playing Blues with his soul like a professional musician. Yes, this is a place where professional musicians spend their days off and music aficionados from abroad (i.e. Italy) show up out of the blue in awe. As a novice, my dad was a bass player in a band while I was growing up, and I remember all of the times he and his band members would gather around a fire and jam to Long Train Runnin' (Without Love) by the Doobie Brothers and songs by Santana along with a faint smell of oregano in the air lol.Be sure to ask for Drew!! I found a couple of guitars that he was kind enough to demonstrate the performance with one of his own songs. Wow!

Every time, I went to the Starbucks next door and two times I used that Starbucks bathroom without buying anything. Once I walked by at night (really deep in conversation about Neko Case for two people who never listened to Neko Case) and waved to the empty store. At this point I feel I transcended from \"customer\" to \"maybe worst customer ever\" and I'm here as a form of penance.May 2013, I turned into two windows before walking into the actual entrance. I'd sincerely like to know if anyone else has done this. It is a very big store. I was with a boy who let me join his band, which I found on craigslist, even though I had no experience playing bass or being in a band. I asked a guy where the basses were - at that point they were not in the \"bassment,\" a concept I found clever - and he brought us to a back room where, he explained, he was filming a music video though he seemed very confused about it. He handed me a thing & I didn't know what to do so I said \"maybe something much less expensive\" and he took back the thing & said something about how \"this one's made in Mexico\" which seemed super seedy to me but my friend nodded & I took the bass and said \"thanks\" & plugged it in but still lost so I stalled until he'd run through 12 iterations of \"can I help you with literally anything else\" and left & I played a self conscious version of \"Tiger Lamp,\" the only song I remembered for the band I was suddenly a part of. My friend played every Joy Division song he knew while the confused guy popped in habitually as if we were hospital patients, and I self-consciously felt like a hospital patient. He said I could have a black guitar or a sunburst guitar, and my friend said I wanted the sunburst, but I wanted the black one very badly and when they put it in a box, I carried it all the way home and this was a metaphor for our relationship. We walked for three hours trying to find the zoo and it started raining. We ended up kissing but that was the only time. I do not recommend kissing a bandmate, especially if it's just because you're confused about your feelings for your ex-boyfriend. That is not to say I don't condone following your heart, though. I condone following your heart.September 2013, I was dropping off my Orange Crush after it started making noises like it had a cold. The guy with the ponytail downstairs said he could not fix it because the individual parts were cheaply made in China. My mouth became dry until he continued, his back to me as he walked into the dark part of the repair room, \"so I'll just grab you a new one.\" And he said I'd wait upstairs, where a guy was playing the same Joy Division songs from May & I took a picture, and they carried the new amp to my mom's car, and Chloe said \"Caitlin did you know there is actual dirt on your back seat,\" and we listened to a mix CD from 2011 that had a Led Zeppelin song on it that Scott Cortez later made fun of in the dirty back seat.February 2014, the amp was having problems again. It is gray outside when the sun is even out and I'm sleeping only in three-hour intervals - I don't look forward to practice until I get there and I'm daunted by everything on the internet. I wanted to forget my Orange Crush, buying something else on craigslist, but I thought maybe I would just take the dead amp carcass back to the practice space to deteriorate. The ponytail guy was working and said, Caitlin, right? With the Orange Crush. This happened a lot. Caitlin, right? I talked to you on the phone. Caitlin, right? I'm the sales manager. I feel this was bad news and I was probably being talked about snidely. Ponytail guy said he'd get Alex, and a guy near the dark part of the repair room started playing a Mark Kozelek-ish song & making forceful eye contact with me while another guy off to the side shifted his glances between the two of us. I watched upstairs as Alex & other employees, including several managers, including a guy in a deep V who repeatedly asked me if I was okay, seemed to orbit in an augmented pace around the store looking for my amp. \"I can just come back...\" But the manager gave me this look like he was about to cry and said he would \"hate for that to happen,\" in a way that seemed non-negotiable. Just wait 5 minutes, just give me 5 minutes, here's what we're gonna do, he told me. We're gonna give you the 50 watt, it's about the same speaker size... is that okay with you? And we're going to get you a nice t-shirt for your troubles. I plugged a Mustang into the (much larger and much nicer) Orange Crush in the bassment as my hands shook fiercely like the day after I bought my own Mustang when I learned all about following your heart and rounded out all nine of those months by playing \"Tiger Lamp\" as confidently as I had ever done a thing in my life. Later, with a CME t-shirt peaking out of my backpack slung over the new amp on the westbound 77, I told Chloe, \"I guess I should have taken a cab.\"", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 2, 24]}, "19": {"description": "I'm jealous of you locals.

The whole experience was really smooth, and the store could not be any better. They literally have everything! The \"practice\" rooms were loaded with really great amps and there's just about every variation of any guitar, from the quirky offsets I like to rare and vintage Les Pauls. Brian was really helpful and took the time to walk me through all the aspects of the Jaguar as I was comparing various versions. The knowledge all the staff has towards these products is very evident - and I wouldn't hesitate to buy everything from them (I am planning to!).To be clear: My Jaguar was packed super, super well - but UPS (knowing them) somehow managed to ship it in a manner that resulted in some paint flaking off...

By the way, it was my instructor Richard who recommended this place to me. So, a referral from a musician/music instructor carries lots of credibility in my book.Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Drew and the rest of the staff worked as a team made up of friends - the opposite of what you might expect at a big container store made up of text crazy strangers with very different lives. In contrast, this place was made up of a \"critical mass\" of musicians, where all of the computers were Mac's and most staff were dressed in tattoos and tripster jeans - which I thought was very individualistic and cool! I could feel the passion and harmony within this temple and, of course, couldn't help but admire all of their fine heirlooms. The guitar room was my focus which felt like a bank vault stocked with precious valuables with shiny lacquered bodies (guitars of course) and a place of worship simultaneously. Let me not forget a man, part of this congregation, I noticed sitting in the middle with his sunglasses on and playing Blues with his soul like a professional musician. Yes, this is a place where professional musicians spend their days off and music aficionados from abroad (i.e. Italy) show up out of the blue in awe.

First, I want to point out that while having a large, expensive inventory is nice, it isn't something that warrants \"5 stars\". Too many falsely believe the meat and bones of a good music equipment store is defined through their selection. Rather, the breadth of repairs and modifications is what truly differentiates stores. I took my 1976 Fender Quad here when I first moved to Chicago. The turnover was about two weeks, nothing crazy, but when I got it back, the thing ROARED. I'm not one to write a yelp review when I'm high on my own satisfaction, so I wait until I can be more pragmatic about the place.September 6th, I dropped off a '72 Electro Harmonix Small Stone just to have it true-bypassed and eliminate the volume drop. It took 2 months and eleven days, when I received it back on November 20th. Ridiculous. I hardly had contact and was really frustrated. Every time I called, I heard they were working on it, but that the year of the pedal was hard to do the simple mods I wanted. I get the pedal back to being the most MIND BLOWING pedal I've ever heard. It really is so unique and beautiful sounding. The quality was so fantastic that it outweighed even the ridiculous wait I had. I later found out that the pedal was very hard to mod due to the age and once I plugged it in, all was forgiven.

Even after I had given them the money for the amp and guitar, they were still cool with me just hanging around and playing tons of pedals through my new amp.When I was only spending a few bucks on a pedal a while ago (probably 1/20 of their monthly revenue) they were more than willing to help in whatever way I needed (they even let me play of vintage 57' Fender Stratocaster for shits and giggles).

Awesome deal. Now the vendor who had been selling this item had a store going out of business in the city. He wasnt able to sell all of his inventory at his location but he had to quickly pay the rent of his store. So he came to the flea market, the vendor sold all of his items. In spite of the fact, people dont carry huge sums of money with them at a flea market due to possible theft. Buyers would get contact information from the vendor and make a time frame for a future transaction. This RC Helicoptor has an easy value of $400 to $500. I saved $300 to $400. Today, I had ventured to swapa-rama on a mission to find effective bug spray, paint, and some hardware tools. Now I am going to be 100% honest. 98% of the people in this swapa-rama are mexicans. Basically, you save alot of money in airfare to a foriegn country even though it may be cheap. Yes. You landed yourself in Mexico as you set foot into this location. Who cares if you can speak spanish or not because green money is everyones language in this little market place. They are not using pesos. I can tell you I ran across three to five non-mexican vendors at this swapa-rama, \u00a0so diversity prevails here as well. Why do you think I had written 98% \u00a0and not the other 2 %? \u00a0Today I had an Italian-American guy sell me some roach gel chemical that has 11 ingrediants to kill those bugs for a year. And I bought a T-Shirt from some Indian Hindu guy on the front of the swapa-rama building. I spent a total of $40.00. An arabic guy runs the computer-security-fix it shop in the back. Not far from mexican cheesemakers, you will see African american vendors. The vendor who sold me the RC \u00a0Helicoptor was a Uzbeki. \u00a0Those are the 2% ers. There is an American guy by the spanish magazine section next to the jewlry items who sells collectible coins and stamps. He has some bargains if you are a coin/stamp \u00a0collector .Anyways, vendors come and go. I had also looked for appliances. Since I manage properties , I had been looking for a bargain \u00a0air condition. Having some mexican tenants, tenants sometimes would sell their stove for a cheaper one so they could pay difference in rent. Why do you think I now go to swapa rama for the appliances? I buy the same item for a cheap price and not lose a dime from them ripping me off from buying a newer item from a place like ABT appliances/electronics. Anyhow, I didnt need to buy a stove. I found out you could get a stove here for $125.00 instead of $450.00. Swapa-rama can be LIKE A GIANT CRAIGLIST UNDER THE FREE SECTION OR SELL MY JUNK SECTION. Instead of driving to a location from craiglist, you have all of the inventory layed out for you. Today, I saw some people selling those large power generators used to power a home in case of an energy loss. The vendor requested a price of $2100.00 for one large generator. Who would want to pay for this amount of money if you dont have manufactures warranty? Lol. Haha. \u00a0If you can fix it; you can haggle him the price for a lower amount. I also saw refrigerators, lawn mowers, air conditions, stoves, snow blowers, jack hammers, and cement cutters. They had alot of expensive used hardware tools. And of course, you will discover mexican fashion and cuisine. I feel the biggest con would be keeping the produce in a not controlled environment because you have so many flies around the sweet fruit items. They need large freezers. Sometimes I think the produce can attract a rodent population if not in control. I also saw the famous bicycle yard. And I didnt see any expensive bikes but older 10 speed models from 15 years ago . There was alot of kids bikes....A few years ago, I heard some people were busted at this swapa rama for pirated software. Now we dont have to worry about pirated software because of open source code software availabilty for free on the net. Lol. Haha. In the back, I saw something of interest. They had cute ponies in the back parking lot area. The little horses were cute and precious. It made my day at this swapa-rama seeing them. The mexican people were charging parents for their children to get a ride on the little ponies.... I wish I was a kid .....I am not going to fit riding those little ponies. Lol. Ha.

Before you even think about visiting this flea market, you need to be prepared:-bring some patience and eyeglasses to find a parking space-bring small bills to make haggling easier-wear cheap dumpy clothing, again to make haggling easier (& to blend in)-bring gloves and sanitizer to keep yourself clean-bring some basic spanish skills to talk to vendors (& possibly get a cross-cultural effort discount? happened to me...)-bring a sturdy shopping bag, because they *will* give you a ripped up Osco bag (and when was the last time you saw an Osco?)Now that you're prepared, you can visit this aight flea market. This is capitalism's cold rock bottom. Anything can be found here, but the key is to dig. This flea market definitely reflects the Mexican community within which it is embedded, so here is where you can easily pick up fresh veggies, cheese, dry foods and candy, religious icons, cheap glittery clothes, baby things galore and cowboy stuff, all for reasonable prices. Check the outdoor vendors first, they have the best deals and are more motivated to sell (read: haggle). Here is one of the few blessed places in Chicago where you're almost expected to haggle.Also, vendors will often leave behind whatever they don't sell, and it is up for grabs. I've found beautiful vintage glasses in great condition and antique suitcases (with working key!) abandoned in this fashion. Don't be scurred, we're all scroungers here.It gets three stars because it's scuzzy, but it's serviceable. And also because it costs $2 for the privilege to explore the esteemed establishment. Enjoy!

Very cool Lady Gaga-esque Virgin Mary-meets-Death statue for $25 which I really, really wanted but found out that Santa Muerte or \"St. Death\" is used in satanic rituals and that scared me a little bit!

It would have made a really cool decorative piece in my living room, though. However, I didn't want to encourage demons to enter my house a la Paranormal Activity!

It's also the former meat packing capital of the country up until the 1960s (and not in the N. Halsted way). The Union Stock Yards were founded back in 1865 and were the inspiration for Upton Sinclair's bestselling novel \"The Jungle\". The original stockyard gates still stand + there's a large plot of stacked old rail cars ...On a humid/rainy night you can still smell meat.Isn't that charming? We passed by a handful of Mexican restaurants, in the predominantly Mexican neighborhood. The most promising being La CeCina, located @ 1934 W. 47th St. ...Full of neon, black gates over the windows and signs I couldn't read (aside from \"pollo\" this/\"pollo\" that) ...I said \"promising,\" right? Well, it was packed ...Generally good sign.We found parking right away + went inside where we were greeted by Amy Winehouse's Mexican twin who quickly showed us a table amongst the blaringly bright blue walls. Within seconds we had chips and a mortar of red salsa. The chips were warm + the salsa had a nice kick. We were impressed + I chose to overlook the Costco-sized bottle of Heinz ketchup by my side.I ordered the \"burrito vegetariano\" which promised \"rice, tomato, lettuce, beans, avocado, pico de gallo\" and per request no queso or crema. I added a horchata + Mike ordered the same but with carrot juice (which he was happy about since the last burrito spot didn't offer it). The menu was surprisingly extensive ...Everything from breakfast options, pastas, soups/salads, fish/whole fish, carnes rojas, aves, cocteles (shrimp, oysters + a combo of both) + the usual standards (quesadillas, tacos, tortas). The house specialty is CeCina Estilo Guerrero: \"grilled thin steak served w/ guacamole, pico de gallo, whole pinto beans + homemade tortillas\".Quick tip when ordering horchata: Always ask for a LARGE ...Otherwise, you'll get a standard plastic Pepsi cup. Though oddly enough when ordering carrot juice this rule doesn't apply because it automatically arrives in a Big Gulp sized container.That said, always ask for LARGE when ordering horchata at La CeCina because it's honestly the best I've had ...possibly ever. It was what horchata should be: homemade/fresh and with flecks of spice.La CeCina promotes itself as a \"family restaurant,\" and while we waited for our food we couldn't help but notice that every other table was full of just that, families. Kids were dancing in front of the jukebox (Let's just say that someone was a little heavy handed with the ol quarters + their love for Selena).Senorita Winehouse arrived with our food in good time (I had tamed the lions in my stomach with my horchata + warm chips).Ok, do you remember as a child being in any sort of required school recital? For me I was in kindergarten showing of Stone Soup. I played \"Villager #2\" or \"potato girl\". Dressed like an extra from \"Little House On the Prairie. Afterwards, a horribly shy child way back when, I remember my Mom fawning all over me as my cheeks grew hot + I wanted to cry into my bonnet.\"You were great, honey!\" my Mother said ...In that somewhat wavering tone. The same tone she would use years later when I got my first pimple ...Smack-dab in the middle of my forehead, like some angry red third eyeball. \"I can hardly notice, Mandy!\".La CeCina's burrito: \"It was great ...\". Honestly? It sufficed ...I couldn't find the avocado (though Mike later swore it was there), standard iceberg lettuce (namely the white parts), the tomatoes were fresh and the beans were a pale purple w/ the consistency of toothpaste. The tortilla was the saving grace: homemade, warm and crisp with a nice chew. Bonus: No Grease.Mike \"loved,\" his burrito + commented that he preferred the setting, \"It looks like they really put a lot of work into this place to make it their own.\" We sat for awhile (Mike had a lot of carrot juice to drink) ...Senorita Winehouse cleared the table + asked how everything was ...In unison with phony grins, Mike + I said \"It was great!\".It was ok and luckily the price was right, our meal totaled under $10, without tip (And yes, we did tip).Before leaving, I ordered a LARGE horchata to go ...Which I happily slurped down amidst fireworks, car horns honking, torrential downpour + the bright lights of Chicago's skyline.I would go back for the LARGE horchata on even the most humid, rainy + meat-reeking day.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 7, 10]}, "3": {"description": "*Note* They took the awning off so you might miss it like we did.

It helped that it was served with almost half a juicy lime plus lots of chopped onion and cilantro. The squash, zuchini, carrots and potatoes were also cut small. The broth flavor was light and it sang more with the vegetables than the meat. I drank a glass of horchata at this point- the house horchata had flecks of spice, really good.The torta ahogada was something I had to try- its the signature dish at my restaurant. Instead of pork carnitas, the meat we use, I ordered the torta with cecina. The specialty of La Cecina- salted cured thin cut steak. The tomato sauce was wicked spicy- the chile seeds are visible in the photo. The salty steak was cut by the spicy acidic sauce, creamy avocado and cooled off with sour cream. At my restaurant the torta ahogada is not available for take out- it is dine in only. There was some joy in taking my torta cecina ahogada to go for the 8 mile trek home.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 3, 11]}, "14": {"description": "The neighborhood mexican joint to go to on the southside.

It is meant to be cheap and affordable. It is definitely better than little caesars pizza and the ingredients are much better. This is my local delivery one, even though I have a closer one which makes no sense but I am happy these guys will deliver. The food is always fresh and good when it arrives.
