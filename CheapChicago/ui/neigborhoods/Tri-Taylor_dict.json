Food arrived in 10-15 minutes and the person apologized that it \"took so long\" - I do not expect Middle Eastern cuisine to be fast, nor should it be. \u00a0It should be fresh always. \u00a0I immediately noticed the food was close to room temperature, it was not hot. \u00a0On to the details of the meat combo:Chicken shawarma: \u00a0Seemed like dark meat chicken? \u00a0The flavor was odd and not in a good way. \u00a0Someone in a prior review here on Yelp said the chicken tasted \"old\" - I agree with that statement.Beef kabob: \u00a0It wasn't a kabob at all (as stated in someone's previous review here on Yelp), just a very thin pounded piece of beef with some seasoning on it. \u00a0It was slightly fatty.Chicken kabob: \u00a0Just like the beef kabob, it wasn't a kabob. \u00a0It was a very thin slice of chicken breast with seasoning on it. \u00a0This was the most \"okay\" thing on my dish.Hummus: \u00a0It didn't taste like it was made fresh. \u00a0I don't know if it came out of a container, but I will not assume since I wasn't in the kitchen.Pita: \u00a0Cold. \u00a0But not stale.Salad: \u00a0Was expecting a Jerusalem salad or something from the same region. \u00a0Instead, just a salad with regular shreds of lettuce and a slice of tomato, spashed with some vinegar dressing.Rice: \u00a0The rice was actually good, nice seasoning. \u00a0But I was very hungry and it's RICE, so maybe I'm being a bit jaded after having ate the things as listed above.Strawberry Mint Lemonade: \u00a0VERY strong taste of plastic, kept sucking up lemon seeds through the straw but caught them in time before accidentally sucking one down. \u00a0Could not finish it. \u00a0As I sit here and write this review, I can still taste the plastic in my mouth one hour later. \u00a0Not good.Sorry Baba Pita, I usually give second chances but this was a rough one. \u00a0I do understand that \u00a0kabobs have a variety of presentations in the Middle East and not necessarily meat on a skewer, however a flat piece of beef, similar to an unbreaded schnitzel, I don't think qualifies, and what was really misleading was the photographs of the Kabobs on the wall.Thank you and good luck with your business.", "rating": "1", "date": [2016, 3, 2]}, "9": {"description": "Avoid this place unless you want the customer service to leave a bitter taste in your mouth.We ordered falafel, some tabbouleh, and beef kabob for delivery.

The beef kabob plate it is. With probably one of the freshest beef kabobs I've had in a while and the dill rice, ummmm yes ma'am! The beef Kabob was not the typical kabob as kabobs go. It wasn't in a skewer or in a cylinder shaped morsel. Instead it was presented on top of the rice in a very typical fashion, but it didn't bother me due the taste. I absolutely thought it was extremely tasty and so tender. I poured a little bit of the sauce that accompanied it and BAMM! I will definitely now be addicted, can you say uhhh ohhh! I think that the place is beautiful (as it use to be Grand Daddy's sub sandwiches) but now, they have transformed the interior into a Mediterranean spot. I certainly can appreciate the fact that an establishment could seriously begin an adventure like this in what was once Little Italy. I love the fact that they have given us variety, as well as a taste that usually is brought in to select neighborhoods. I see a good future for the Baba Pita, and I truly hope that more will come out and see what I have seen and tasted. I don't think you will be disappointed but if you feel overwhelmed at the variety, by all means ask for a suggestion as I did.

She said this happens sometimes and they would go back to normal in a couple of days. The whiteness is gone but my gums are a little scabbed up and open sore looking. I've been using lots of mouthwash to make sure they don't get infected and they seem to be healing quickly. I looked online and this happens sometimes when the peroxide gets on your gums. Apparently its not supposed to happen but it's not that big of a deal when it does. I think it's partly my fault for not telling her I could feel some burning/tingling on my gums.

He hands me my stuff and then proceeds to tell me he has no change. What delivery guy has no change? That's ridiculous. He's lucky I didn't need change or else it would have been a problem.So I was very excited to have my food. I mean Papi's never disappoints right? WRONG. WAY...WRONG. :-(My milanesa looked burnt and the meat was black! I kid you not yelpers. Black meat (shuddering). Oh and needless to say that it tasted funny. Sort of like old grease. YUCK! The refried beans weren't even cooked all the way. Beans should never feel crunchy or solid. So I decided I wasn't going to eat it and instead sit in my house ad sulk. I started thinking you know what? I don't have to take this! So I called and explained to the guy on the phone that the meat was burnt and black and tasted funny. I explained to him that I had been a loyal customer since they first opened and that the meat/batter was not the same. He claimed that even though they moved they are still using the same meat. He then offered to send me a new milanesa dinner and asked for me to return the original one. I gladly obliged.So when I got the new dinner it looked better then the first. It was not burnt at all the only problem was that it still tasted like old grease. I'm not sure what is going on over there but there is no way in hell that they're cooking the milanesa the same.

The mac and cheese was fantastic. The sweet potatoes were gross (thats if you know what good soul food taste like) \u00a0In addition, I ordered a catfish sandwich.

My one problem with the menu though, was that there was an older version and a newer version- they did not specify that until I ordered, and paid more than I thought I was going to. The lady at the register just dismissed it as an \"oops these are the new menus after you paid\" kind of deal.The food took about 10 minutes to arrive, and when it did portions appeared to be quite a bit smaller than the average Indian restaurant. The food tasted pretty fresh, but it was truthfully underwhelming. It was very bland, very average, and not out of this world spectacular like the other reviews suggested. Yes, the chicken was tender, the samosas were somewhat crunchy, but it was nothing life changing or spectacular. To be honest, I was truthfully a bit disappointed because I had read the reviews of this place on Yelp. The food was not flavorful, my chicken Karahi tasted pretty watered down and bland, honestly.

I was greeted quickly upon arrival by a very sweet older lady, and saw the paper menus in front of the register to order. I ordered chicken Karahi, and the samosa bites. There is no ice with your water, but that's fine. My one problem with the menu though, was that there was an older version and a newer version- they did not specify that until I ordered, and paid more than I thought I was going to. The lady at the register just dismissed it as an \"oops these are the new menus after you paid\" kind of deal.The food took about 10 minutes to arrive, and when it did portions appeared to be quite a bit smaller than the average Indian restaurant. The food tasted pretty fresh, but it was truthfully underwhelming. It was very bland, very average, and not out of this world spectacular like the other reviews suggested. Yes, the chicken was tender, the samosas were somewhat crunchy, but it was nothing life changing or spectacular. To be honest, I was truthfully a bit disappointed because I had read the reviews of this place on Yelp. The food was not flavorful, my chicken Karahi tasted pretty watered down and bland, honestly. And the samosas were full of oil- I bit into one, and oil squirted out of the other end! I had expected a bit better, but the food is not bad by any means, just lacking in flavors.

I went with the butter chicken, which was rich and nicely seasoned (although slightly salty, but if you get rice, it kind of mellows it out). In my opinion, this place is super cheap. I paid $8.96 for a curry, rice (you can choose between rice and paratha), and a pop. Considering just how many places in this general part of the city charge $12 for entrees and an extra $2.50 for rice, this was suuuuch a steal. I also received a ton of food, and I'm pretty sure that after adding the rice, this is going to last for at least two more meals. I'm thrilled to have a place like this in the neighborhood, but my one complaint is that I wish there was something like a chicken vindaloo on the menu.

I didn't think it could get much better than that, but with the space and resources of the Jarabe kitchen at their disposal, they are churning out the most delicious and authentic Mexican food you will find in Chicago. While their dishes are unique, these guys simply make the classics BETTER than anyone else. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Chilaquiles (my personal favorite, on a bed of ridiculously tasty chips), etc. My girlfriend tried the breakfast burrito and gave me a bite so I could experience the crispiness of the potatoes, truly unique! As she pointed out, breakfast burritos are often drippy messes stuffed with too much eggs and cheese. This was a balanced, nuanced Burrito with a variety of flavors and textures. In fact, she just texted me a picture of it with the caption \"Remember this???\" I think we'll be back.Okay, I wanted to give the previously mentioned chips their own paragraph. If you stop in and don't get a full meal, you're missing out. But if you don't get at least some chips and salsa/sauce/guac, you're letting down the whole human race. These chips are what I call \"two-ply\" meaning it's almost like they're made of two thin chips joined together. They sort of bubble up as a result and are flaky, crispy, warm, and perfect. They are made fresh several times a day and heated in the oven for maximum warmth/crispiness. Just the right amount of coarse sea salt. If you love tortilla chips and salsa, you will not want to go back to the bagged, bland, or otherwise stale chips found at 90% of other Mexican joints.Seriously, SO satisfied with our meal.
