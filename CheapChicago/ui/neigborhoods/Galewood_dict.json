When we first arrived, the table next to us, a party of four, had a birthday at the table. The employees came over and sang \"Happy Birthday\" and put a sombrero on the birthday lady's head. I told my dad we should tell them it was his birthday, but he is a modest guy. As we were eating, a woman at another table received the same birthday cheers. This time, I noticed that she was given a shot. My dad then got out his ID to show the waiter, CARLOS, that is was also his birthday.

He does not relish attention, but tonight, he needed to also feel special. My mom and I sat in belief. Surely, at some point, the staff would come over with birthday greetings. They didn't.

The chips are exactly the kind I like: thin and crispy, with just the right amount of salt. The salsa, however, was the low point of the meal. A bit watery, & not much spice whatsoever. It didn't taste bad, but was definitely mediocrity in a cup. The burrito was nice and big. The meat inside was steaming hot, and the cheese was melted nicely. They didn't over-do it with the sour cream, which I'm glad about. The rice was pretty flavorful despite there not being any vegetables in it.

Anyway, the pastries were okay--nothing to die for, but we decided to stick with our appointment anyway since wedding cakes are different than regular pastries.When we went, we were taken care of by an elderly lady who is, I presume, one of the ladies in the wedding cake department of the business. (I think this because when I called a couple times for wedding cake inquiries, I was always transferred to her.) She was nice; she gave us a few binders to look at, gave us some samples to taste, and took down some information in the case we decided to go with them. The cake dough was okay; most of them were very light and tasted very standard; my fiance and I liked the chocolate frosting the best, but again, the other frosting flavors were very standard and nothing out of the ordinary. The lady quoted us a price--which was very affordable!--and told us to give her a call and that she'd take care of us. (We were relieved because we read Matt B.'s negative review about the rude customer service he received. Another customer who was there for a cake tasting appointment was being taken care of by a man, and she was treated very rudely!)My fiance and I decided to go with Domino's, so I gave them a call on the Wednesday before Easter. (They're not open on Monday, and though they're there on Tuesday, I was told that they're not open for business that day.) The lady who answered the phone put me on hold so that I could speak with the wedding cake lady, but she came back on and said, \"She asked if you could call back next week because it's the week of Easter, and she is very busy.\" Okay, sure, understandable.When I called exactly a week after, the same thing happened. The lady was busy and would need for me to call back later. I guess the lady on the phone sensed my hesitation when she asked if I could call back again; I told her that I was told the same thing last week and that I would like to place an order since all the details had already been worked out. The baker woman finally got on the phone and sounded so annoyed. I told her that I'd like to go ahead and place the order. She kept asking me what I was saying, what my name was, where I'm having the wedding--basically everything she had already written down on her sheet of paper. She finally found my information, and when I told her that I'd like to go ahead with the order, she told me that I'd have to schedule ANOTHER appointment to confirm the order. I asked her if I could just place the order and come pay the balance in full, but she was resolute in me coming back; I agreed and asked her when I could make an appointment. She said I'd have to come back in JUNE. (I called the Wednesday after Easter--still April!) I asked her if I could just drop in since she already had my order and I pass by the bakery all the time, but she said I'd have to wait until JUNE since she was booked.Needless to say, my fiance and I have found another bakery that is just as affordable and a whole lot nicer! I'm not one who is easily turned off by bad customer service, especially since people can have bad days, but this was just unacceptable. No matter how great the cake could have turned out, the customer service was quite atrocious, and I am not willing to drop hundreds of dollars if this is the kind of service we can expect even BEFORE the actual day of the wedding... I'd be afraid of what could happen on the actual week or day of the wedding!No thanks!", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 5, 7]}, "19": {"description": "I'm 37 years old, and have been getting my cannoli's from Domino's since I was a child.

We were not picky, and we had no preferences except that it would be vanilla and have a strawberry gel. Presentation-wise, it was good. We had no expectations going in to our wedding reception, except that we were excited to take our first slice.We grabbed the knife and started to cut off the top...only to find the knife wouldn't budge past the top layer of icing. Our initial thought was \"it's okay, it's just frozen.\" So we kept trudging at it, until my husband managed to chip a tiny chunk off the corner. We thought nothing else of it for the remainder of that night, and the staff at the banquet hall managed to pass out delicious slices to all our guests. My in-laws took the top layer to store in their freezer until it was time to enjoy it for our first anniversary next year.We finally pulled it out in excitement, thinking it was going to be delicious and enjoyable. I started to slice it, only to find the knife was not budging again. I knew it wasn't frozen, because it was thawing out for the past couple days. Then I noticed that there was something underneath the top layer of icing...something that wasn't cutting through.I finally dug into the top and discovered the issue. It turns out the bakery decided to bake the top layer of cake with a sheet of CARDBOARD! And not just cardboard...it had wooden pegs nailed into it and wedged into the entire top layer of cake. Now, forgive me if I am still new to this wedding cake methods, but I'm pretty sure that the bride and groom are supposed to take the top layer home to EAT a year later. (You know, eat as in, safely consume...as in NOT CARDBOARD) Professional bakery or not, this is clearly NOT how you make a cake for someone's wedding.I am severely disappointed, and what's more, beyond annoyed that this happened.

For me, it also involves buying all the ingredients to make my special spicy wing sauce. Trust me, my sauce is legit - just ask my mom (no really, she likes it a lot, and it's NOT just b/c I'm her daughter and she has to like what I make). Sometimes, though, you just want wings quick, hot and fresh. Enter: Wingstop. This place is a chain, but my opinion on chains is that they must have started out at least somewhat decent in order for someone to want to franchise them. (Wow Bao serves as the giant exception to that b/c I can't imagine that place ever having been good). That being said, I genuinely like Wingstop's wings and love Wingstop's fries. LOVE their fries. There must be brown sugar or something sweet in the seasoning b/c you get a nice combo of salty sweet of which I can't get enough. Better yet, when I don't want to make wings, I order ONLINE (impersonal communication at its BEST) and have hot, fresh wings in 25 minutes. Quick - check. Hot - check. Fresh - ...CHECK!My main gripes with Wingstop are: -- the subpar service/set up of the restaurant where pick up orders are not separated from walk in orders,-- the rolls. WHY do people insist on serving gross items and saying they're complementary - it's truly beyond my comprehension, and most importantly -- the variety of wing flavors i.e. their hot aren't hot enough but the atomic are just inedible. I may be spoiled as I've already had the best wings of my life in a joint since closed in Lawrence, Kansas. Oh, Mojo's how I dream of your 5 alarm wing sauce. I have a huge gripe with wing places that just throw lots of hot pepper onto a wing and call it their 5 alarm or atomic or what have you wings. I love super spicy. What I don't love is a wing that has no flavor but spicy. There is no fun in eating a wing b/c it's hot if the flavor sucks. I'm speaking to you, atomic sauce.

I've only done carryout on my two visits, but with both service was prompt and friendly. Out of many of the thai restaurants in the area, this is Amarind's is high on my list on the \"I want to dine in\" scale.Now onto my favorite: food assessment! Caveat: I have a lot to assess, so this'll be a long review. Happy Reading.APPETIZERS:Chicken Satay: Least favorite - I'd say it's simply ok. The peanut sauce was definitely good, but the chicken was like a chicken cutlet on a stick. A little too \"I could have gotten this at TGI Fridays\" for me when it comes to satay.Chive Dumpling: These tasted fresh - always a good thing, I'd admit. I wish the tapioca dumpling had been fried a bit (not like deep fried but like how they'll be slightly fried like a potsticker at some places) to add a new level of texture. Otherwise, the filing tasted incredibly fresh and delicious. Also, they serve this with sweet soy (I like to add extra chili peppers to my soy), which is the way I like these served.Crispy Egg Batter (Thai style omelet): Delicious and worth the $9. The chili sauce accompanies the dish perfectly.Crab Rangoon: (We know by now that I'm a girl who loves her crab rangoon, and being from St Louis - the \"crab rangoon is rumored to have been created in STL and therefore is the\" crab rangoon capital of the world - I'm very picky about my rangoon.) In any case, these were very good - cream cheese mixture was creamier than some other places, the flavor was krab-ier than other places, and the pieces of krab and celery were clearly visible in the mix. I love the way they fry these crab rangoon too - they're not overly fried like some places; in fact, the wonton skin is a little bit undone around the center's corners. Whether or not intended, it adds an extra richness to the appetizer.Entrees:Pad Kee Mao with beef: Although not like the kee mao from LOS that I am always chasing the dragon for when I try it at other restaurants, this was good. They delivered on spice, but I also asked for extra spicy, so I'll definitely remember to ask them to add the heat if I choose to order this again. The different vegetables were good; it just didn't really seem like the kee mao as I would expect it. The thick noodles were good though, perfect thickness with a little bit of crispness from the stir-frying.Pad See Ewe with beef: Meh - definitely not the best. I loved the addition of the bok choy but was disappointed by the use of american broccoli. Further, the bok choy wasn't completely cleaned at the stems, so I would encounter a dirt taste that would overpower the thai flavors from time to time. I probably wouldn't order it again.Kaosoy with chicken: I will admit that I don't like thin noodles. I thought this dish might have thick noodles b/c it's known as a northern thai dish (and they have other northern thai dishes on the menu), but it didn't. Despite the thinner noodles, it was still good, but the curry was actually kind of bland. Panang with Chicken: The panang was good - you definitely need to ask for it extra spicy if you want the heat - although as another yelper pointed out, it has no veggies in it. I'd order it again; it fits in with that, \"I want something comforting after a long day\" type curry, of which I'm a HUGE fan. Oh and the steamed rice that accompanied the curry: some of the best I've had in the area. In any case, Amarind's is good; I just haven't had a knock-me-out delicious dish that I would crave as I have had with some other places. Hopefully, my next visit will lead to a boost in ratings.

We ordered 3 appetizers , presentation was nice but with the exception of the small side of cucumber salad that comes with the satay -and which is awesome- \u00a0the actual taste of the appetizers was just 'ok' .. the main dishes were better than average - i really did enjoy the pad thai, but was a bit put off that they charged $1 extra for extra peanuts with it-first time ive ever had that happen with the way i order my pad thai anywhere else -and thats how i always order it =) .. the other thing that annoyed me is a peevish thing, but it annoyed me all the same. \u00a0i asked for a large glass of ice with water as my drink - instead of bringing me a larger glass with ice in it (which they have for the iced teas and coffees), the server took my small glass of water away, came back with it half \u00a0filled with ice and then poured new water into it. She was good about repouring the water when we would run out but that original ice was the only ice i got .. A small thing, but one thats more annoying for me than the $1 charge for the peanuts because the use of a large glass and keeping me stocked with ice -or at least asking if i wanted more- costs nothing. \u00a0The one other thing that annoyed me was the table across from us had 4 people and ordered after we did -there were only 2 of us- . yet they got their food first. And the first dish that came out was pad thai -which was exactly what i had ordered as well. Service wasnt bad but i got the feeling that because we came in in jeans and tshirts and the other table was obviously a bit more well off their service came before ours. Would i go here again? i might come back to try the lunch special \u00a0but to be honest, my favorite dinner place for Thai is still going to be Opart Thai.", "rating": "3", "date": [2010, 9, 25]}, "21": {"description": "Went here tonight for the second time with a friend and we both agreed everything was excellent. We were seated immediately despite it being pretty packed.

But everything was piping hot and tasty. I ordered the Pad See Ewe and was delighted. The variety of ingredients in the dish made for amazing flavor combinations. I liked that there was a plentiful amount of meat and vegetables instead of them just loading the plate with noodles. Another plus was that the portions were fairly large.

Overall the food was not impressive at all but its fine.
