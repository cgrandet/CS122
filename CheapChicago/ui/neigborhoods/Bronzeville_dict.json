This particular morning on Christmas Eve, I decided to go back there and buy another gift card. I have always been aware that customers can't use a credit card to purchase Visa, American Express, Mastercard debit cards, and other major credit card gift cards, but I have always been able to use a credit card to purchase gift cards for Old Navy, Whole Foods, Macy.s, I Tunes, Facebook, Dunkin Doughnuts, Starbucks and etc. Since someone at work had given me a gift, this was the perfect opportunity to give them a gift card especially those that do not require a 5.95 cent extra charge for the card. The young lady at the counter insisted that I had no knowledge of what I spoke on. She told me (without going a get a manager) that you can't use a credit card to buy a gift card. I told her \"no, you can't use a credit card to purchase a major credit card gift card\" and then I asked her to check. She insisted that those were the rules and I told her \"well ok, thanks you\" and walked out.I then took my money to another pharmacy. I purchased a Macy.s gift card. I paid with my credit card Visa and that was that. Then I went to Jewel Food Store. I purchased another Victoria Secret gift card. I paid with my Visa, walked out the store and that was that. What is really funny is online, you can use your credit card to buy any gift card you want, from any store you want except you can't purchase Visa, American Express, Mastercard, and any other major credit card gift card. Why Walgreens staff are not all aware of this is a mystery to me, but it should not be different for one store and then another procedure for another store. Everybody should be on the same page.

I'm at one of Chicago's White Castle joints and order a jalapeno cheeseburger because I'm a sucker for spicy and cheesy.

While \"hot and steamy\" would be great adjectives to describe any scenario, I can't say I like my slider bun or meat patty tasting steamed. As for the jalapeno cheese, it tasted like a cross between pepper jack cheese and jalapeno cheese poppers. You can taste the jalapeno-ness, but it lacked in any spiciness.In the end, I'm just left wondering, \"Wait, am I missing something about the White Castle hype?\" Maybe it's because White Castle has been around long enough that it just becomes ingrained in Midwest culture.

Prior to booking my appointment at Huetiful, I literally followed their Instagram page and took mental notes of the stylist who produced outcomes that I was going for. Huetiful's salon booking website makes you select your stylist first but there aren't any descriptions of their work nor are there any pictures of some of the styles and treatments the stylists have provide. This is where following their social media accounts were especially helpful. I have really thick 4c natural hair so I knew I wanted a stylist who could flat iron my hair and have the style last more than one day. I'm happy I was able to get an appointment with Kyra. Kyra was ready for me at the start f my appointment. She started off by talking to me about my hair. She asked me what I liked about my hair, the last time I shampooed and the last time I had a trim. We then moved to the shampoo section where she first clarified my hair, then used a moisturizing shampoo, then applied a deep treatment which contained peppermint oil, then sat me under Huetiful's industrialized steamer for an entire 25 minutes. She then blew out my hair, flat ironed it and gave me a cut (since my last trim was 2 years ago!)My hair was shinny, it had movement, and it just flowed effortlessly. I was able to keep my natural hair straight for 4 whole weeks, even while attending bootcamp and yoga classes, something I never did previously.The only reason why I docked Huetiful one star is because I noticed the salon was a little unkempt and some of the furniture had rips/were dirty with stains. One important note: the difference between style option 1, 2 and three is the amount of time allocated for a stylist to do your hair. I initially booked style option 1, but while Kyra was flat ironing my hair she realized she would need more time and I would actually be a style option 2.All in all, I am happy I was finally able to visit the Huetiful Salon Chicago and let me tell you, it is an epicenter of healthy hair practices.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 12, 30]}, "11": {"description": "Today was my first visit to Huetiful and I was thoroughly impressed.

My reasons for 4 stars is that their greystone isn't labeled well at all, so I had a hard time finding it the first time.

I've had a shampoo and blowout by Nina, devacut by Monique, and partial highlights by Raquel. ALL of these stylists were very friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable about hair care! Nina turned my shampooing session into an educational experience that I LOVED. She gave me a towel to dry my hands and let me \"touch and feel\" my hair at the different steps of shampooing. She also explained the ingredients of each shampoo and why she was using it. Nina explained that once you're a Huetiful client, you can see any stylist in the salon and it's not awkward. You can schedule online with any stylist that fits your schedule and services needed. This also allows you to get services done by the stylists that specialize in whatever service you need.

This left me with alot more grey than I realized I had. I didn't want to make any hasty decisions so I waited 4 months before deciding to return to color. I HATED MY COLOR and was in desperate need of a Devacut. Previously, I had found a curly hair salon in which I was very happy with but unhappy with my one way 80 minute commute. After a freind recommend Huetiful, I made an appointment for a color consultation, color and Devacut. Unfortunately, \u00a0I had to wait 3 painful weeks for an appointment as a struggled to continue to wear my grey growing curly afro. After waiting 3 weeks for my appointment, I received a call the morning prior from my colorist asking if I could move my services times around. \u00a0I agreed just as long as my cut would be accommodated appropriately. \u00a0She said she'd figure it out and call me back within 1 hour. Well, I never received a call back from my colorist. However, my stylist did contact me the evening before my morning appointment to basically inform me that she was booked and couldn't provide me with a cut as scheduled but I could get my color services and return another day for my Devacut (40 min drive one way). She apologized several times but it doesn't make my situation any better. I have an engagement upcoming and I am now stuck!When booking appointments online Huetiful stresses how busy they are and stresses their cancelation policies. Well last week something unexpectedly came up at the same day and time as my previously booked services. In light of Huetifuls cancelation policy, I had to do some \"creative\" manouvering in an effort to keep my scheduled appointment. This continues to add to my disappointment. I'm not really sure went wrong here. But to say I'm now reluctant is an understatement. Huetiful is pretty pricey and seems to pride itself to be a somewhat of a unique experience. I would agree with the unique experience as I have never heard of or experienced such a issue with a business!I wish I could provide more information regarding Huetifuls services but its looking very unlikely.Part 2...I decided to go in for my color appointment as it was after 8pm before I realized I would be unable to obtain both services that I originally scheduled and I had a professional event to attend in a couple of days and was REALLY in need of a color and cut. After discussing the situation with my husband, he convinced me to give them another try. Afterall, they are 30 minutes closer to home than where I usually frequent. \u00a0So I did - MISTAKE!!!When I walked it the salon seemed clean and decorated nicely. Everyone seemed very pleasant. \u00a0But it seemed as though there was little to no ventilation; as I began to start coughing as soon as walked in.They scheduled me to return the following Tuesday for my Devacut. Although I was happy with my color results, other than a slew of apologies, \u00a0I received absolutely no financial consideration, even after explaining the hardships their scheduling error placed on me including a 40 minute drive each way without traffic.Tuesday morning, I receive a call from Huetiful Salon explaining to me that I had an appointment 30 minutes prior to the call. I explained that I had left a voicemail message the day prior cancelling my appointment (I went elsewhere for my cut).

What I especially enjoyed is that she emailed me the day before my appointment to speak to me about my hair needs and what I was looking to do. I greatly appreciated that and speaking with her was easy. Fast forward to my appointment. After reading the reviews on how to get to the building I found it with ease. All I did was look for the scissors on the side of the building and there it was. Parking was good didn't have an issue with that. I was blown away by the professionalism and \u00a0hospitality of this salon. It was clean, played great music and had a very chill vibe. They offered me water and all the hair stylist spoke to me.Now the getting my hair done part....I was nervous about the health of my hair and that was a concern of mine but I was calmed by Lakia when she said my hair appears to be healthy and all I would need is a good trim. While going through the process she stopped and informed me of everything she was putting in my hair and how beneficial it was. My hair felt soft while she was shampooing, the scalp massage was gave me LIFE and the hair streamer was relaxing. She blow dried, clipped my ends and flat ironed my hair. My hair never felt better...it had sheen, bounce and it felt so soft. When I walked I felt like a wind machine was right in front of me it had so much body. It was a great experience and I HIGHLY recommend this salon.

Prior to booking my appointment at Huetiful, I literally followed their Instagram page and took mental notes of the stylist who produced outcomes that I was going for. Huetiful's salon booking website makes you select your stylist first but there aren't any descriptions of their work nor are there any pictures of some of the styles and treatments the stylists have provide. This is where following their social media accounts were especially helpful. I have really thick 4c natural hair so I knew I wanted a stylist who could flat iron my hair and have the style last more than one day. I'm happy I was able to get an appointment with Kyra. Kyra was ready for me at the start f my appointment. She started off by talking to me about my hair. She asked me what I liked about my hair, the last time I shampooed and the last time I had a trim. We then moved to the shampoo section where she first clarified my hair, then used a moisturizing shampoo, then applied a deep treatment which contained peppermint oil, then sat me under Huetiful's industrialized steamer for an entire 25 minutes. She then blew out my hair, flat ironed it and gave me a cut (since my last trim was 2 years ago!)My hair was shinny, it had movement, and it just flowed effortlessly. I was able to keep my natural hair straight for 4 whole weeks, even while attending bootcamp and yoga classes, something I never did previously.The only reason why I docked Huetiful one star is because I noticed the salon was a little unkempt and some of the furniture had rips/were dirty with stains. One important note: the difference between style option 1, 2 and three is the amount of time allocated for a stylist to do your hair. I initially booked style option 1, but while Kyra was flat ironing my hair she realized she would need more time and I would actually be a style option 2.All in all, I am happy I was finally able to visit the Huetiful Salon Chicago and let me tell you, it is an epicenter of healthy hair practices.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 12, 30]}, "46": {"description": "I almost didn't write a review, but since my hair still feels super moisturized and silky smooth 2 weeks after my Huetiful Hydrating & Conditioning Treatment, I have no other choice. In addition to the conditioning treatment, I purchased the style 2 option (medium-sized flat twist updo) and a Huetiful Healthy Hair Consultation. Monique Clay provided the best customer service that I've ever received in a salon. She was friendly, informative, and professional. The salon had a very relaxing atmosphere while still feeling upscale. I waited a few minutes before being served, but not long enough for me to start checking the time. I felt that Monique listened to my hair concerns and treated my hair with TLC. She explained each step of the treatment process and the products she used. Looking back, I probably could've skipped the Huetiful Healthy Hair Consultation since I'm not brand new to the natural hair game and already new a lot of the advice provided. (It's just a matter of doing what I know I need to do!) Regarding the style, I'll admit that it had to grow on me for a couple of days, but it was simple and just what I needed as a busy mom. In order to cut back on the expense of going to the salon, I was planning on pushing my next visit until a month or two from now. However, since my hair feels brand new, I will have to cut back in other areas so that I can make my next hair appointment as soon as possible!

Warning to new clients, there are no signs in front of the salon which makes finding it a bit challenging and they turn the phones off after a certain time (maybe 5pm) so no one is able to assist you via phone after that time. I found this out the hard way after searching for the salon for about 10 minutes, all the while, tugging on several locked doors that I thought could be the entrance.After finally arriving 20 minutes behind schedule I was told there is a 15 minutes grace period and no one was available to do my hair. What? I wish someone would have told me that earlier when I called to confirm my appointment and explained to the women on the phone that I had never been to the salon before. Long story short, I was not able to get my hair done. The stylist did say she could reschedule my appointment for another day, which I was considering until she said, \"and we won't even charge you for this missed appointment, which we usually do\". Really? No thanks.Tip for the owner: I understand your 15 minute grace period rule, but you might want to think about keeping the phones on until you close for the day or placing a sign out front so new clients can locate your business.Anyway, my search for a good natural hair salon/stylist in Chicago continues...", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 4, 22]}, "9": {"description": "Today was my fourth visit to the salon. \u00a0The salon itself is in an old grey stone building where they have converted the first floor into a salon. \u00a0There is a cute waiting area, but so far I have not had to wait in it very long. \u00a0Everyone is friendly and speaks to you, even though you are not their client. \u00a0They have coffee, tea and wine, so that was a nice touch to have my stylist bring me a drink while doing the steam treatment and a stand to allow me to put my drink and IPad on instead of having to try and juggle everything.I have had two stylists and both were great. \u00a0The shampooing was amazing...not sure what they were using as I was in the chill zone, but it felt like a brush of some kind massaging my scalp. \u00a0The shampoo seemed to go on forever and I loved it. \u00a0The steam treatment was not what I was expecting...it is actually cool on the head, but since I have been going to the salon, I have noticed that my hair is more hydrated.I love the fact that I can book my appointments online and cancel them online when the need arises as I don't want to try and get anyone on the phone. \u00a0And I love the 15 min rule about not showing up on time for your appointment. \u00a0My time is valuable and I don't want to be sitting in a chair all day to get my hair done. \u00a0So far I have been out in under 1 hour 20 mins and looking great each time. \u00a0I love that when I sit in the chair, it is my time and they stylist isn't trying to do 23 heads at the same time.Overall I am very happy with my experience there and will be going back.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 8, 8]}, "26": {"description": "I went to Huetiful Salon out of desperation.

The experience overall was pleasant. The stylist was very nice, and the salon was clean and well cared for. However, to say that I was extremely disappointed with the results would be an understatement. While my hair looked fine when I left the salon, as I got outside I noticed that my hair smelled burnt. So much so, that a checkout girl at the store I stopped at commented, \"What's burning?\". Um, that would be my hair.Over the next week, I noticed a large number of strands falling out of my hair when I combed or brushed it. Alarmed, I went to my regular stylist. Sure enough, she found a large section of my hair had been burned so badly that the hairs were breaking off and falling out. I currently have an area about 1.5-2 inches in diameter where my hair is completely broken off, fuzz patch city.

Not because I didn't experience the most wonderful hair transformation, but because I don't want more people to go and make it EVEN harder for me to get a hair appointment. **caution it's a LONG review, because I feel it's needed, feel free to jump to the bottom**As I continue to progress on my hair (natural) journey, I find that until natural becomes critical mass or people understand different textures of hair, it is critical for you to find someone who understands your tresses. I think Huetiful has really got a gift for education. So let's begin.Appointment: You HAVE to book online. Once you get the hang of it, making an appointment is easy. It's hard to start out. When you select a stylist, you are presented with \"selections\" (i.e. style 1, style 2) but you do not get a description of what that is. On a separate page, you are given a rundown on what is included in those styles. Also, be sure to have a credit card on hand to book your appointment. I repeat, you must book online.Location: The salon space is a renovated home in the Bronzeville community. First time there, you do have to do some looking and then you hesistate when you think you found it because it a random location with limited signage. Look for the shears or the Chicago Public Libary. If you pass it, you've gone too far. The sheers will take you to the transformation heaven.You are greeted with a smile when you enter. The salon is modern, fresh feeling, and clean. I mean THIS is how you should spend your time being pampered. It really is like a hidden oasis. Each stylist station provides a level of privacy yet the space is still open, which is a nice touch. They have fun, feel good music, piping overhead.The Experience: The best I've had in a very long time. Definitely the best I've had as a natural and it's been almost 3 years. So I booked with Nina Christmas, she started in their Atlanta location in 2012 and I see she has been a force ever since. When I sat down I gave her the lowdown on my tresses. I was at the point of thinking of cutting it all off because it was just TOO much. She took me to the bowl and that is where the education by science began to happen. She gave me a mirror and literally explained everything she was going. She debunked a lot of myths and said their salon is ultimately trying to shift the paradigm about natural hair. She explained a lot of times, our hair is \"unruly\" because we are using the right products or the right methods. As she selected products, she let me take work a small section into my head. When she detangled, I watched in my mirror. It was the first time that I was detangled and I didn't coil back up. It was like NEW hair! OMGosh. Now for some people, they don't want to talk to their stylist, I was there to learn and absorb. She definitely gauges if you are a talker or not.My hair was SOOO soft during shampoo, I couldn't believe it. I mean we detangled during shampoo, who does that?! I guess I will be now. Then came the condition, hair is still soft and tresses are still not coiled. We make our way to the infamous steamer to add and seal the moisture. If's a fascinating little gadget, but my hair felt really good. We rinsed the conditioner and were ready for styling.Soo I appreciated Nina because she again told me everything was happening. She used a lower setting to blow dry it (no burned follicles here) and then we flat ironed it. This was my first experience with a stylist telling me that we would start at a low temperature and work our way up if my hair did not respond. It ensured my tresses only used enough of what they needed which leads to health in the long-run. We looked at my ends.. had a discussion about the trim and we were off. So final touches.. because my appointment was running over and someone else's appointment was starting, she politely told me that she wanted to get her next appointment up and running and she would be back. That's true professionalism.When she returned, we were ready to curl my hair. I thought this was going to take FO EVA.. but her technique was QUICk and I was fabulous looking.. because it was a monsoon outside, she put my hair in these pin curls, but said.. you need to be able to wear them. We can't have you looking crazy. It's day two and I'm still rocking the pin curls with soo many compliments.Bonus: She said that all her stylists were fantastic and they all had a different specialty. She said at any time feel free to check them out for wash n gos, rod sets etc. We work as a team. You NEVER hear that.Such a great experience and affordable. I can't wait to go back.

Previously loved this salon but will NEVER return.This weekend is my graduation from college and obviously a large event in my life, so I trusted Huetiful with my hair (they have previously done my hair on my birthday and I had a great experience.) My roommate is also natural so I recommended she book an appointment the same time as me so we could go together. We rented a zipcar to drive to the salon (its pretty far because we live in Evanston). We left Evanston at 10:40am for our noon appointment, but were caught in heavy traffic during a terrential downpour. I called the salon twice around 11:30 and was sent straight to voicemail, where I let them know our situation which was completely out of our control. Finally, we arrive at the salon at 12:16. We are told that the 15 minute grace period has ended and I remind them that I called to let them know in advance. The extremely rude receptionist lets me know that my friend's stylist will honor her appointment. However, my stylist has not only canceled my appointment, but charged me the late fee. This situation could not have been handled worse for the following reasons:1. When I booked my appointment I was not alerted of this policy at ALL and received no confirmation email2. Nor did I receive a reminder email for my appointment with this information listed3. The lateness was out of our control and my efforts to communicate the lateness was ignored4. They honored my friend's appointment but not mine, though I recommended her and am a repeat customer. When I tried to get them to squeeze me, the receptionist rudely said it was impossible because of my hair type (my friend is 3b) even though I was already detangled5. I called my credit card company and I was charged at 12:10, DURING the grace period6. Their honoring one appointment but cancelling another shows a true lack of investment in customer service. You are taking chances when selecting a stylist!! When my friend brought up the policy to her stylist the stylist had never even heard of it. This gives each stylist the ability to mistreat customers at their will7. I never received a receipt for the unfair charge, which is ILLEGAL. Businesses may not charge customer credit cards without their consent/knowledge and providing proof of purchase8. I made it clear that I would be willing to wait but my efforts were ignored by ALL STAFF.

In true Yelp fashion though, I will give the real deal about both visits and won't sugar coat my 1st 2-star experience but will also rave about my lovely 2nd time 5-star visit.TIP: There is no \"HUETIFUL\" sign on the building, so look for the address. It's located next door to the public library, and there's free street parking but only enough space for a handful of cars.Unlike most salons, their timeliness is impressive. You have to make appointments online with a credit card hold. If you cancel less than 24 hrs in advance or arrive more than 15 mins late, you will get charged the full amount and will not be serviced. I like this policy! If a salon is going to respect my time and get me in and out without overbooking or delays, the least I can do is show up on time for my appointment. And the price is fantastic! Starting at $65 you get a steam condition treatment, trim (if needed), and style options off the Menu 1 list (e.g. press, twist out, bantu knot out, flat twists). The price goes up based on styling options and trims over half an inch are considered a cut for an additional $25. One downside is that the number to the salon is basically a general answering service. No live person answers the phone so if you have questions - good luck. I wanted to change my service from Menu 1 to Menu 2 and had no way of doing so without canceling my appointment and HOPING I could rebook for the same time. I called, left a message, emailed, but got no response so I just crossed my fingers and hoped she could squeeze in the time for my extended service. Huetiful should really figure out a better way. Perhaps post each stylist's number directly on the site.Starting with my 5-star review: Patricia was fantastic!!!

Thankfully, she was ready for me and said she would work it out. I appreciated that she said if her next client came in, she would stop and attend to her in order to keep her schedule. I like that. She was willing to accommodate me but stay true to her other clients too. That's professional. I have dry scalp so I told her to make sure she washed me thoroughly. She had already said she noticed and was planning on it already! Observant and proactive. I like that too! I wanted a flexi rod set since I had never tried that style before and it turned out lovely! I got so many compliments before even leaving the salon, you couldn't tell me nothing! Aside from having a great salon and styling experience, Patricia was really cool, down to earth and easy to talk to. My friends know that I'm not really chatty like that - especially not at salons and my stylist at another salon is kind of mean frankly and doesn't talk very much LOL - so I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed my overall experience. I will definitely pay Patricia another visit or two or three ;-) and recommend her to anyone who wants a clean, fresh style!Unfortunately my 1st visit with Tasheara sucked (no sugar coating). I desperately needed to re-wash my hair within just 2 days. Washing hair is a basic service I shouldn't have to stress about. It wasn't until after she had blow-dried my hair for my press that she said my scalp wasn't clean. Considering she was the only person attending to me during the visit, I was shocked!! How are you just now noticing this? At the bowl she had even commented on how detangling and brushing during the wash really helped to better cleanse the scalp. Wrong. So at this point, wouldn't you think she would re-wash my hair? I mean, no way, she's going to style a client's not-so-clean hair right? Wrong again. She said, \"I'm just not going to flat iron all the way to the root since your scalp isn't clean.\" Umm, so a) you didn't wash my hair properly and b) my roots won't be smooth. Great, what a disappointing waste of time and money! I was pissed. That was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard or experienced.I was initially going to do a twist out and Tasheara said I would only need a light dusting of my ends. However when I switched to a press, she said I needed a full INCH cut off! That's the tough dilemma of trimming wet vs. dry. I've been natural for 8.5 years and have done both and the frustrating dilemma still remains. I hate wearing my hair straight but whenever I do it seems I always need so much taken off yet when I rock a curly style, I barely get a dusting. I'm still scratching my head on this one... ugh.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 6, 30]}, "33": {"description": "I've now come twice. After my first visit I thought I'd finally found a styling home in Chicago. After my recent visit, I probably won't come back. The two stars are for my first visit where my stylist was friendly and educational. Also because this salon takes you on time (hopefully every time) and too many other places fail to respect your time. The negatives were the salon was overbooked and my stylist was having trouble finding a station to work in. The first time I had my hair trimmed but my style was a braid out. This meant they didn't trim the whole hair but just the part that was out at the ends. On my second visit , I asked for a blowout trim, she did it but then proceeded to not follow my instructions re the trim. It looks fine straight but I know my curly looks which is how I always wear my hair ( and yes I shared that with the stylist) will be a challenge. On my first visit, I was talked through the products, had a great shampoo, and my hair was de tangled while wet. My hair this time was yanked through dry (which never works for my tight coils) and while she apologized for yanking. She also blamed me for having such damaged hair.My scalp wasn't clean and there was dandruff flying out as she styled. I've never had hair professionally washed but left dirty. I'll have to wash it again in less then a week. But the final straw is that a stylist made me feel ashamed and embarrassed about my hair, I mean my hair wasn't perfect and I definitely needed a trim but that's why I was there. I haven't felt ashamed like that since going natural, and the side comments from other stylist walking by didn't help. And I'm certainly not going to pay $200 to feel that way.

I was seen right on time by Brenda & got a pretty thorough hair \"diagnosis\" & told her what I wanted & then she got right to it giving me a precision cut. The ethos is all about the health of the hair & Brenda took great care of me & my head. My hair is very curly--4A & very fine. I loved my cut, deep condition & steam treatment. Brenda cut my hair dry & wet for the best precision cut. I thought I was going to get finger coils but I really only needed a wash & go and that's what I got. I have the cutest, curliest, most hydrated & healthy TWA (teeny weeny Afro) that I've had in years. Most of the things Brenda told me about how to care for it I already knew but I appreciated the reinforcement. I was in & out in about 2 hours.

The salon is just what I was searching for. It's upscale, calming, and the stylists care about healthy hair. My goal for this visit was to get a drastic haircut - a tapered hair cut - and I really needed to find a stylist that I trusted to design a chic, funky style. My stylist was Shawanna who seems very professional and friendly. Oh, and she knows what she is doing. My new haircut is so fun! It's exactly what I had in mind, except better. (I brought in a Pinterest picture for guidance. She got the idea and rolled with it). When styling, I liked that she told me what products she was using and why. It put me at ease and I appreciated the communication. For my final style, I chose flat iron, which turned out silky and has lasted several days now. Next time i see Shawanna, I'd like to try a non-straightening natural hair style, and I'll update after that experience. All the Huetiful stylists care about natural hair, so I'd feel safe and assured in making an appointment with any of them. That said, I believe all stylists have their specialities, and I wish the Huetiful website promoted those more prominently. For example, I feel that some are better at natural hair styles while others are better at straightening natural hair. Some have a passion for and are skilled at creative haircuts and others are more colorists. It's just odd to think that every stylist is a jill-of-all-trades. When making your first appointment, I'd suggest calling the salon to get recommendations on who could best fit your needs. Hopefully you get a candid response.

I had been coloring my own hair (since '09), but decided to try professional services so that I could get better, even-looking results while wearing a lighter color ( I have been wearing a lighter color for over a year now). As for style, I opted for a wash & go. I was not fully confident in getting anything else because I've never had my hair \"done\" by anybody else as a natural. I've always done it myself. At first, I was not really enthused with the results for two reasons: my roots appeared to be way darker than the rest of my hair and my wash & go was a wash & 'fro by the time I got back home (within 40 min. of leaving the salon). The stylist used the Deva Curl line on my hair...that was a first as well. But when I got home I began to like the color better! (My bathroom has great lighting!) Anything lighter would have made my roots look washed out. So, I definitely will be back for a color touch-up, with me taking my own product.

Occasionally, some of the stuffed pretzels are good, if you get a student who can make them well.

The store constantly has problems with temperature regulation and I've walked in more than twice each week on probably 85 degree heat. So, not only is all of the cold food getting warm, but everything from candy to chips/snacks goes bad quickly. With the exception of maybe one or two employees, almost every person who works at this store seems to show a lack of respect for customers or motivation to do their job properly and efficiently. Some employees handle the hot food well, but most of them leave pizzas and other snacks out, and still try to sell everything after it's been sitting out for at least 5 or 6 hours. First, I think 7 Eleven needs to get a handle on the quality control of this specific location. Every other location I've been to, specifically in the loop, always has fresher food and a larger variety. I'm not saying this 7 Eleven needs to start serving alcohol like the others, but I would really like to see more variety and better quality. Also, temperature maintenance is a HUGE problem. I don't know what is happening with that, but every time I've bought food from there when it's hot inside, it has always made me sick. I don't intend on going back until that problem is fixed.I'm hoping other IIT students and Bronzeville residents would agree with most of this. Also, another addition - this 7 Eleven is EXPENSIVE!

The salon is in the South Loop Hotel - so there's free parking and its not far from my West loop home. My stylist JOJO is AMAZING! Truly the best hair stylist I've ever been to! She's one of the nicest people I know, she is professional, punctual, and most importantly - she actually cares about my hair! Since I've been with her (since I left Toss hair salon), my hair has grown longer than it has ever been (as an adult). Once, I asked her to color my hair and she honestly and frankly told me that I shouldn't do it - my hair wasn't strong enough to handle the damage of color at that time. My old stylists would have just colored away regardless of the damage to my hair. JoJo is the best!! A selfish part of me wanted to keep her genius as secret as possible, but it wouldn't be fair to deprive others of the ability to leave the salon feeling absolutely beautiful. The salon also has a great aesthetician - Shaddah - I've been to her for a facial and a few times for waxing. She is very good, takes her time to make sure the job is right, and she is very professional. Also, the salon sets out products, jewelry, head wear, and purses for sale. These pieces are nice and pretty reasonably priced. I find myself buying something each time I go. The prices vary for the stylist. Some might think that JoJo is kind of pricey, but her rates are comparable to many other stylists in the downtown area, and (unlike the several other stylists I've been to) JoJo's is worth every penny! Shaddah's prices are comparable to other day spas in the city, but a bit cheaper than the ones downtown.

I ordered the whole grilled red snapper with djolof rice. \u00a0My fish was a little overcooked, but 3 other folks in our group ordered it, and theirs were tender and flaky. The rice was really delicious, as were the plantains and yucca that I tasted ( off other people's plates). \u00a0They were out of dibi lamb, so I gangstered a taste of one of my friend's Maffe.

The server didn't write down any of our orders, and my entree came with the incorrect side.Do not recommend the thiakry. This dessert has the taste of a sweetened creme fraiche, but the steamed millet inside was a strange textural element for me- it reminded me of grape nuts in a good vanilla yogurt.

We had ordered from them before so we told them that last time we ordered, it was about $4. They wanted to negotiate to $8 and we told them no, it was $4. (It's $4 on grubhub). That should have been the point when we stopped trying to order. IT ONLY GOT WORSE from then.We were told our food would be at our place in 30 minutes. Great. Reasonable time. An hour passed. No food. We called and they told us that the driver left 30 minutes ago. My roommates and I live 10 blocks away from this place. IT DOES NOT TAKE 30 MINUTES BY CAR. Okay so we waited again for 30 minutes. NO FOOD. We called again. The guy on the phone doesn't know where our driver is. WE HAD TO WAIT 2 HOURS FOR OUR FOOD. That was ridiculous. Especially when we were told we would only have to wait 30 minutes. The main frustration was that whenever we called to check, THEY KEPT LYING TO US. They kept saying that the delivery guy had left or just left. And we just had to keep waiting. We ordered our food at 6:30pm and got it at 9pm. Oh but it was about to get worse.When we opened our food, we realized that our orders were not complete. The rice that was supposed to be with all four of our orders wasn't there. The missing rice was not a big deal but granted that we had to wait so long for our food to arrive and discovering that our orders were incomplete, we were pretty angry at this point. We called them again and when we inquired for the rice, they told us that there was no rice with the dishes. We told them that the online menu said it would be included and we've gotten rice with our dish last time we ordered (not too long ago). They told us that the menu was a decade year old. \u00a0We told them that it's not our fault they haven't updated the menu and they told us that they will deliver the rice for us. WE WAITED FOR 2 HOURS AGAIN and guess what? NO RICE! They never showed up. My roommates and I finished an entire movie while waiting (and we probably could have watched another movie while waiting for our food).So. We are never ordering from this place again. DO NOT EXPECT GOOD SERVICE. Also they will try to RIP YOU OFF with the delivery fee. They also lie to you and tell you that the driver has left and then later saying the driver has just left again. Oh, at one point they told us that the driver was right by our place and we called and canceled the order so the driver turned right back around. THAT WAS A BLATANT LIE. We never canceled anything.

I have ordered from this establishment several times. Therefore I think I am justified in doing this review. Yesterday like any other trip to this fast food chain I placed an order through the drive-thru. I ordered a South-west salad with medium fry. Naturally your suppose to receive salad dressing of your choosing. Well that of course did not work out for me. Instead of receiving ranch dressing I end up with \u00a0french dressing. The salad did not have all of the ingredients evenly distributed. I had the beans and corn on one side and tortilla strips on the other. My grilled chicken was not properly cut. Now I am going to dig into the lack of customer service. The cashier/food preparer usually have no personality when accepting orders. On top of that the car in front of me had some issues with their order after pulling off. The customer randomly parked their car and walked back to the window where I was waiting to pay for my order. I had to move my car because the guy was unable to squeeze through to the window. Once we caught the cashier attention he addressed his issue. The cashier did not redirect the previous customer back to his car. He told the customer \"one minute\", them left him standing in the cold weather. On any given day I will have any number of issues with this location primarily the service. You can't always blame the employees, management has something to do with the service. Finally, I do not venture inside this establishment EVER! There is usually an armed security guard present and for good reasons. The last time I went inside I notice an ambulance outside with lights flashing. After several inquires I found out the guard sprayed an individual while they were in the bathroom.

However, I keep seeing reviews on how horrible the food is and how horrible delivery is. I cannot speak for those as I have only tried the Pizza and have never gotten anything delivered. I always get pizza slices in the store and they are quite delicious and fresh. However, make sure you bring hand sanitizer if you want to wash your hands as they don't offer their restroom to the public.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 3, 24]}, "41": {"description": "just finished their chicken philly it was great!

Just to be sure they got my order, I followed up by phone. \u00a0The guy said \"Oh yes, it's in the oven now.\" Then someone called me a few minutes later to say that they were out of mushrooms and it would take even longer for them to go to the store and buy some. \u00a0So what happened to it being in the oven now? \u00a0I was annoyed that they had lied to me, but agreed to wait. \u00a0When the pizza finally arrived, the guy was apologetic and gave me a free liter of Pepsi in an attempt to make up for the problems. \u00a0We don't drink soda pop, but it was a nice gesture anyway. \u00a0The pizza was OK.
