The stuffing was good but could've used more sea food. \u00a0I wouldn't order it again, but I'm just a gringo so I'm sure these are authentic. \u00a0They were still good just not what I was expecting.The next thing we had was the sauteed Calamari. \u00a0This was absolutely delicious. \u00a0The calamari was not rubbery or mushy but perfectly \"toothy\" or al dente. \u00a0I think they used jarred garlic, which I typically don't like, but it worked in this dish just fine. \u00a0It was muy picante though. \u00a0I like spicy food but this was a little too much. \u00a0Next time I will order milder.The Mussels came next. \u00a0I still have dreams about these. \u00a0They seem like they're pan fried which I've never had and the sauce is a rich browned butter. \u00a0These were the best I've ever had and next time I'm getting 3 orders. \u00a0Delicious!My wife and I at this point were getting pretty full and since the portions were huge we split the Filete Relleno entree and it was to die for! \u00a0The tilapia was a little \"muddy\" since it's farm raised which is typical of any tilapia around here but was easily overlooked with all the stuffing. \u00a0The Octopus was cooked perfectly too. \u00a0Next time I will order a Pulpo dish separately to enjoy more of their octopus.As stuffed as we were at this point my wife had never had fried ice cream before so we had to. \u00a0They fried the outside with corn flakes and I think because of the size of the flakes they were oily and chewy. \u00a0Don't get me wrong though, we devoured it.I cannot wait to go back to this place and try more dishes. \u00a0Especially since it's BYOB. \u00a0They only charge a $3.50 corking fee which I think is fair. \u00a0We had to wait 20 minutes at 3:00pm on a Sunday so keep in mind that you will have to wait and parking is sparse. \u00a0You will have to walk.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 2]}, "38": {"description": "Ambience is awesome, outside under palapa umbrellas, beautiful sun, music playing.  \u00a0Ceviche was a 7 served as an appetizer, camarones sarandeados a 7, langostinos get a 6 out of 10. \u00a0They \"ok\" but the ones from El Cangrejo are way better and more delicious.

Imagine jj fish charging sushi grade prices and you get the idea. You're only fooling the plebs, guys; your product is sub-par, bulk-bought, frozen garbage. Retool your business model. Unless overcharging for sea-garbage to reap undeserved profits for as long as you can until people realize what they're eating is nauseous or they die from ingesting it is what your going for.

As the sign pictured here on Yelp notes, the actual entrance isn't on Ashland itself per se. Instead, it's perpendicular to the street, just off of a small parking lot. From the lot, visitors enter via a short staircase onto a loading dock. (Alternatively, it seemed like you could also enter through an additional storage and loading area towards the back of the parking lot, if stairs were an issue. Definitely call ahead if you have any accessibility questions or concerns).Once inside, from the perspective of looking into the warehouse from the loading dock, there are three things to see: To the left, a live bottling line; to the right, along the back wall, a display of historic drinking containers; in the middle, dozens of pallets of freshly made Filbert pop....and that's about it. There's no receptionist. There's no signage (that I noticed). There's no retail space. You're just in the middle of a small warehouse. It may not feel right at first, but you've found the correct place, in all of its light industrial glory.Filbert's is an active work space and you may need to wait a moment to catch anyone's attention. A couple of minutes after my arrival, one of the guys in the warehouse offered up a spare case and there was no rush or pressure while browsing cases of pop for sale. With a few exceptions (notably, ginger beer: $1 each), each 12oz glass bottle is $0.50 and you're welcomed to create mixed cases of whatever is available. A small shelf held a few popular flavors in larger sizes as well. Filbert's line includes well over a dozen pops (\"sodas\", as I'd call them back home...), but the Draft Root Beer is the centerpiece. While I didn't bother to confirm whether or not every flavor was in stock, it seemed like most were.Depending on the day, you might be able to find out a little more about the company or get to check out the line. Be forewarned though: there is not a formal tour or anything of the sort, so your experience may differ from that of fellow Yelpers.As far as the sodas themselves? There wasn't one among the eight that I selected and didn't like, but none that I'd add to my 'must-try' list either. The most pleasant surprise might have been either of the lemonade (a tart, refreshing, snappy version that made me wonder why carbonated lemonade wasn't more popular) or the blueberry (a not-too-sweet fruit-flavored drink with a clean, fresh finish).

Give Joe several titles you've enjoyed in the past and he will come up with something you've never even heard of!

There are several monthly plans you can subscribe to (we have 2 out at a time, about $25 per month). Only wanna rent family movies? There's a plan for you too, $4.99 per month. Oh and I mention the selection of video games? Yeah, it's extensive too! I hate to mention it, but I have to.... There's an epic xxx section complete with Girls Gone Wild and all the parodies. You're welcome. Pretty much every hit show that's ever been on television is there and when you rent a series, you get the whole series not just one or two discs at a time. Joe also takes requests and custom orders, so if you dont see something, ask! Don't feel like going out? Oh well they also deliver!

He has been anxious to eat there ever since we started waiting for the 35th street bus outside of Papa Freddy's after shopping at Target. He pointed out to me that the painted windows outside say \" Sausag\" Pizza. Maybe over the years, some street punk scraped off the \"e\" in Sausage from the window. Well, I ordered 2 Pizza specials. That's a slice of your choice of Sausage, or cheese pizza with a can of soda, and some fries. The slices were pretty big , they were cut into these little squares. I don't know if that's how they serve it up always or not. The next time I will have to ask them not to cut it up in tiny little squares like that. Also the fries weren't bad at all. I forgot to mention that if you want a slice of Pepperoni, it's 30 cents extra. The pizza special is $5.50 cents. The same special, pepperoni is $5.80. They served us pretty quickly I have to say. Both me and my son enjoyed it, and really there was no complaint with the food at all. The only complaint I have in my review is this. It was hot on the day we went in to eat. There was no air conditioning. They had a fan on a table and basically it was just blowing hot air all over the place. I think they used to sell hot dogs outside or something because there is a retired bright yellow Hot Dog cart parked right inside of the place.

The pizza is delicious, however, the customer service isn't that great. They are always super busy and rush you off the phone when you order, the blonde lady in particular. They appear to be chatty & friendly but let them mess up your order and they can become rude & unaccommodating. There were countless errors with our orders over the years that we dismissed because we just love the pizza but this time I will say we will no longer be customers. We are \"regular\" customers as we order pizza for every PPV fight, every gathering we have, party, etc. We do not order out unless we order from Papa Freddy's. A week or so ago I ordered a Family pizza and they replaced the 1/2 spinach and mushroom order side with sausage. I called before even touching the pizza and the man told me that they would just replace it since it was already very late, close to 10pm and my kids had not even eaten yet and would have to wait another hour to get a new pizza. The other half was cheese so at least they got to eat, we do not eat pork so the other half was trash. We took the \"credit\" and called it even. I called tonight to order the \"credit\" pizza and was told that they would just charge us $18! The pizza was $20! A $2 credit?? I told the blonde lady that that wasn't what I was told and he told me he had written my name down with a credit for a family pizza. She said that they NEVER credit a whole pizza and at the most will only discount $5 or come back, pick up the pizza and deliver a new one. I continued to press the issue that that wasn't what I was told and she put me on hold and came back and said we will take off $7 which is WAY MORE than what we EVER do! Wow! Then I said well if that's the best you can do this will be my last order and she hung up in my face! I previously \u00a0told her that we have been ordering from them for a very long time and she said well I've been here for 15 years, so?? Well, that being said, good-bye Papa Freddy's.

Bill certainly tries his best to communicate and does an excellent job. \u00a0Let me say this, I was able to clearly get across to him what I wanted but then, on my second visit, I brought a picture. \u00a0Both times, this man was spot on. \u00a0Seriously blew my mind. \u00a0The cuts are precision and never rushed. \u00a0After your cut, he then takes you back to the shampoo area and you get a fantastic rinse and then back to the chair for drying and final styling. \u00a0Bill also treated me to a chair massage on one of my visits. \u00a0It was given by a wonderful woman named Ivy. \u00a0Though we had a little language barrier, just by genuinely wanting to communicate with each other, we ended up having a great time and laughing. \u00a0I was also in pure bliss with the massage and Ivy adjusted to my needs perfectly (we also had to be mindful of my right shoulder and artificial elbow area). \u00a0She was awesome. $12 for 10 minutes and it was well worth it and then some. By the way, Ivy is now my \"First Wife\" and they can explain the story behind that! \u00a0:)Some tips that will help you - 1) \u00a0They are always accommodating and you can call them at the last minute and they will get you in. I do recommend giving them a call to make sure. \u00a0To date, in the last year that I have gone there, never EVER have I not been able to get in at my time and taken care of. \u00a02) \u00a0As I mentioned above, my first visit was a total success as the cut was awesome. \u00a0However, I brought in a cut \u00a0shown in a specific picture the second time, just to make it easier to show what I wanted that time, and he was spot on. \u00a0 For the average customer that may not have the desire to try to bond with another human being in a natural non-rushed manner, this will be a time saver and make it very easy for Bill to give you the look you want to achieve. 3) I highly recommend \u00a0the chair massage by Ivy. \u00a0For this, I suggest calling in to make sure of her schedule as I believe she is off on certain days. Note - I also saw his prices for a woman's haircut. \u00a0I have been told that they are affordable compared to other places. \u00a0So ladies, I highly recommend you check out their pricing. \u00a0Bill is a master stylist and if you bring in that pic and give him a shot, I am sure you will not be disappointed. \u00a0The place is always clean in every area that I have observed. \u00a0Bright and nicely colored interior that is welcoming, energizing and yet relaxing. \u00a0Cho, Bill and Ivy have been wonderful and I even try to communicate via testing out my Google Translate app. \u00a0We have had a lot of laughs and I have to say, I truly appreciate this staff. \u00a0I took a chance in between cuts twice (both for even tighter budget reasons at the time) and I regretted it. \u00a0When I went in for a \"hair rescue\" on my next visit to Bill, he was able to seamlessly correct the challenges. \u00a0Check this place out, people. \u00a0I would be completely stunned if you do not enjoy your visit and the results.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 8, 25]}, "2": {"description": "They are moving soon to 3324 S Archer Ave so everyone can still know where to find them.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 7, 5]}, "5": {"description": "This is my first time at this salon and I am absolutely floored at how happy I was during and after my hair cut.

I was disappointed on several occasions, but it really depends on the day of the week I guess? The waitress has a good memory of my order so she will remember to add a chili oil for me when I order my crepe :DFor dinner, I recommend the salt and pepper pork chops, salt and pepper string beans, or the japanese tofu with king mushrooms. Half an empress chicken (basically the dinner for two) is also something I usually order too. For the price of approximately $25 you get half an empress chicken, garlic veggies, a soup, and a salt and pepper shrimp. I've tried the minced beef fried rice and it was just weird tasting to me (maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of red meat). During family dinner, you get a dessert on the house.

I chose to spend my entire walking around Chinatown. I'm a huge lover and supporter of anything and everything Asian, so im shocked it took me as long as it did (1.2 weeks) to make it down. Chiu Quon was the first stop on my journey. I wanted/needed breakfast so I knew some baked treats would do the treat. When I first entered I was so overwhelmed by all of the options. Honestly, I almost cried because everything looked so delicious but I knew I couldn't try everything I did a little research (via Yelp of course) to see what other Yelpers recommended customers try, so with that I ordered 1 BBQ Pork Bun, 1 Egg Tart, and 2 mini mooncakes.Oh. My. God.Orgasmic reactions to all 3 items I ordered. 1st, that BBQ pork bun was like the better looking cousin to the Sloppy Joe. That BUN was the softest of doughs - very similar to the Hawaiian roll! It was perfect. The Portuguese Egg Tart was scrumptious as well. The custard was very light and frothy, and the vanilla extract was very prominent throughout. What sold me was the crust. Very flaky and buttery. The perfect contrast to the custardy filling. Last but not least, the mooncakes. I have been dying to try mooncakes for almost a decade and now that I have finally tasted them, I may have found my new favorite snack. What I loved was the red bean paste for the filling. It was unlike any dessert I have ever had in my life, because there was a very vegetable-like taste to the cake, but it was sweet, and the outer dough was very sweet. It was just perfect.

From the more American Chinese items such as eggs rolls to the more authentic items on their Chinese language menu everything is spot on. The service is very friendly and attentive.

There are at least 3 huge tvs, one for each wall and they are always on. They aren't loud because I think they have the sound off since each one usually is showing a different station but they are annoying. I wish we could eat in peace to enjoy the delicious food. Maybe they can have one time a week where the tvs are off. We would eat at that time every week!Also I would LOVE to have the other menu translated. Not sure what language it is in because it could be Mandarin but it could be another language but I want to know what is on there!

We returned to work very late by the time we finished eating. In addition, our order was lacking. My lentil soup had no lemon (which is how it's served according to the menu and the only way I like it. Had I been informed I would not have ordered it) and when I requested some I was told that they didn't have any. Really? You opened your (Mediterranean!) restaurant less than an hour ago and you have no lemon? Also no soap in the bathroom. Also they changed their usual presentation of hummus to contain chunks of un-tasty tomatoes vs the usual fresh olives. This place is not cheap, but due to the lack of healthier food options in the area it is certainly always busy. I would love to support them but management needs to get it together. Have an adequate amount of staff at lunch times during weeks days. Don't change/eliminate the little things that make the food appealing (especially when you wait a ridiculous amount of time for it).

He was rude and acted like he did not want to be there. He also forgot the extra sauces we asked for. I was annoyed but my food was good, so it didn't stop me from coming back about a week later for more.This time ChrisJ was the cashier again, he was still mumbling but he seemed to have received an attitude adjustment, or maybe it was because my wife was with me this time. He was a bit more polite but still looked miserable. Another uniformed worker was out cold on one of the tables sleeping. No big deal, we thought, maybe his shift was upcoming or he just got off. We had a somewhat large to-go order, so we expected it to take 15 minutes or so. We sat down and waited. ChrisJ and another teenage looking worker seemed to be the only workers on duty.

We were like, if you had told us, we'd have said forget the rice and the like 3 vegetables you put on each plate. We are super late! He apologizes sincerely, throws in some free dessert. We have to tell him make fresh fries since the fries have been sitting out done this whole 45 minutes and are now cold and soggy.

One of the waitresses was sick and I watched her actively cough repeatedly into her hands, then switch to using a napkin to cough into and then back to her hands. She casually wiped them on her apron and then picked up some toast, buttered it, placed in onto a plate and served it to some unsuspecting guest. EFFING GROSS LADY! She also had giant long green painted fingernails. St. Patty's day is over lady, cut those things. You work in a restaurant, do you have any idea what sorta germs live under your nails when you're not coughing like you have SARS? I'm gonna guess probably not! It appeared as though she didn't even give a second thought into her coughing fit right near all the food....ugh!!Thankfully Mike and I had another waitress and I watched her like a hawk! I also watched to make sure the SARS lady was no where near my plate when it came out. Bacon and cheese omlette was yummy. Had to ask for a refill, though, they were busy. Ordered cake to go, after we had already paid. The cashier seemed annoyed but EF her, she had just arrived a mere 10 minutes before we were paying our bill. I'm totallly bitter while writing this review....ugh just grossed out. It should also be noted I was here about 3 months ago and ordered the same bacon and cheese omlette and found a hair.

There was something about this imagery that made me keep this place in the back of my mind as a place I had to visit. Well I finally got to put my curiosity to rest this weekend as I ventured in for the first time and I am happy to say it was an absolute pleasure.  From just skimming the reviews I see a lot of comparisons to Huck Finn. It's the same basic gist: homey diner feel with an array of comfort food that's good for the soul, but not for the heart. I haven't been to Hucks in years, but my visit to Archview pretty much reminded me of what Huck was which is a pretty good thing in my opinion. The staff was very friendly and quick though they can be a little bit pushy (in a gentle way) in trying to get you to try other menu items. The food portions were moderately generous depending on what you ordered. I ordered the Clock Special which came with 4 pieces of french toast, 2 eggs, and your choice of bacon or sausage. My philosophy is that you can't go wrong with breakfast foods so my meal was perfect. The bacon was nice and crispy so I highly recommend working bacon into your meal. My friend got one of \u00a0the Saturday specials which was a HUGE meatball sub with fries. What made the meatball sub even more extraordinary is that instead of 2 flimsy pieces of bread sandwiching the 2 giant \u00a0(and I do mean GIANT) meatballs, they used thick pieces of garlic bread. Yes, that's right garlic bread! Needless to say \u00a0my friend definitely got the better deal, but I was still happy with my breakfast item (I have an intense love for breakfast foods so whenever I can get it you bet your side of hashbrown I am going to order it). Both of our meals were 7-8 dollars bringing out total bill to about 16 bucks which is quite a deal since we both left really satisfied. \u00a0 Conclusion: I like to group Archview in special category of restaurants I like to call \"Old people restaurants\", which means delicious home style foods served in a comfy (carpeted) dining room that makes you think you were eating at grandma's house. Plus \u00a050% of the patrons are probably collecting social security. I love these types of places since they give you good food in a quiet/calm environment so I give Archview a thumbs up. Added bonus: The UNIQUE thrift store is a block or two away so after you enjoy you meal you can walk off those calories by looking for a bargain.

Before, they used to have the bread baskets with bread that wasn't put in a wrapper, and they used to have a variety of bread sticks, but I didn't really eat those anyway because the servings for every meal was huge.When I was younger, I loved eating the kid's spaghetti with meat sauce. \u00a0Years later, it's still one of my favorite dishes (except from the adult menu), but I've also gotten around to trying other dishes. The French Onion soup served on Sundays are excellent. I will purposely make room in my Sundays to have a bowl or quart of French Onion soup there. The amazing thing about it is that it's different from all the other French Onion soups! The Chicken Stir Fry and their Chicken Caesar salad is pretty decent, but the skirt steak is amazing. It's always cooked perfectly with potatoes that are pretty great too. And this is all at a reasonable price in a very homey environment. Highly recommended... And if any of you guys eat the spaghetti with meat sauce there, can you guys try to figure out the recipe for me? I've been trying to master it for some time now.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 16]}, "15": {"description": "They have good breakfast's and there breaded pork tenderloin is very good.

Main dishes are always so much I share with my friend. They're kind enough to always be able to split it for us. We are full for tw people just under 20$. They're breakfast menu is all day long, which I adore since there's not really an ihop near. They have daily specials which are great with discounts. My favorite are their cream soup, though bacon cream soup was a but too much, the broccoli cream soup was magnificent.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 8, 27]}, "36": {"description": "The food at Archview is average at best, but I don't think most patrons come with expectations of a high quality meal. If you do, you will be sadly disappointed. It is what its is- a convenient, cheap place that somewhat-satisfactorily meets your craving for a variety of greasy foods with huge portions.

My husband & I were eating lunch when all of a sudden we heard a loud woman's voice saying \" you got a problem with me? Come over here then .\" A manager or whoever she was, was talking to her bus boy like this which was totally unprofessional in front of the customers. She then proceeded to keep being loud & call people stupid & other derogatory names. It was such an unpleasant scene to watch & she made everyone feel uncomfortable. You don't treat your employees like crap in front of your customers- you take them to the side or the office & address any issues. I refuse to have my meal ruined over bitchy managers with attitude problems.I don't know her name but she has a small tattoo on her neck behind her ear.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 2, 21]}}, "neighborhoods": ["McKinley Park"], "latitude": 41.830810546875, "longitude": -87.6774749755859, "rating": "3.5", "times": {"Mon": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Thu": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Sat": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Wed": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Tue": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Sun": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"], "Fri": ["6:00 am", "10:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Diners", "diners"], ["American (New)", "newamerican"]], "address": ["3480 S Archer Ave"], "attributes": {"Has TV": "Yes", "Parking": "Street, Private Lot", "Take-out": "Yes", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Wi-Fi": "Free", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes", "Noise Level": "Average", "Caters": "No", "Outdoor Seating": "No", "Alcohol": "Full Bar", "Delivery": "No", "Waiter Service": "Yes", "Good for Kids": "Yes", "Attire": "Casual", "Wheelchair Accessible": "Yes", "Ambience": "Casual", "Dogs Allowed": "No", "Takes Reservations": "No", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Good For": "Breakfast, Brunch"}, "category": "Restaurants", "number_of_reviews": "78"}}
