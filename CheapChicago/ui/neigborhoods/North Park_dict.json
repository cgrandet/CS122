The bowls may look small for $8, the bowl really fills you up and keeps you full for hours.- Spinach and Pesto Bowl - This is the menu item that turned me into a believer. It is absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, this is the quinoa bowl with the most calories coming in at just 480 calories. -Quinoa Chili Bowl (Chicken) - This bowl is good, but I found it a little underwhelming. The chili just tasted like a marinara of sorts without the usual kick of chili. I do love that they substitute the sour cream with a dollop of greek yogurt. It really works. Overall, both bowls are delicious. They are a tad bland, but luckily Protein Bar had TWO varieties of hot sauce (Cholula and Sriracha). \u00a0With some hot sauce, the bowls were perfect.SERVICE/AMBIENCEProtein Bar looks like an upscale fast food place.

The bed was sparkly clean, with high tech looking bulbs. Just as I started to get undressed, the girl who was helping me, began knocking on my door. She stated, \" I was looking at the coupon again, and its actually for the level one bed. I'm sorry!\"OK, not a big deal at all. So I walked into the level 1 bed, and literally stopped at the door. I've never seen a bed like this; very dinky, and even to the point where it looked unsafe. I thought I was over reacting, so I got in the bed anyway. I was kind of scared tanning in it (just because of how small it was, and it was really old). As the session wrapped up, I came out a tiny shade darker. I think this place has very high potential, but they definitely need to upgrade their level one beds (there are three of them) The level 2 is a stand up, btw.

A joke.I came here looking to buy \u00a0screen door & 2 ceiling fans, and wanted to have all 3 installed. This means I was prepared to spend somewhere between $750-1000. Sure, we didn't need to buy in contractor quantities or have our entire roof replaced, but that's still a fair amount of money for us (probably for most people) and you would think they would appreciate the business. Well, you'd be wrong.Upon entering, someone near the door said hello and as I passed the guy making popcorn, he said something unintelligable about popcorn. I smiled and continued on to ceiling fans. I looked around a while and see they have prices displayed for installation ($139 for the first fan & $119 for the second). I decided what I wanted, but moved on to the door section to have a look there before asking for assistance- not that I saw anyone around.I looked through screen doors, utilizing about as much experience as I had with the ceiling fans. To be clear, my experience level is that I have used both a ceiling fan & a screen door before, so...obviously vast experience. I probably looked like a real expert, which is why no assistance was offered to me at any point during my visit. In any case, there were a couple options I liked, and so I returned to the front of the store in hopes of finding an employee to help. On my way, I passed one employee who lowered his eyes to the ground & walked way as I neared. I was still feeling pretty positive & excited about my home improvement project at this point, and figured \"Well, he's probably in the middle of something.\" As I reached the ceiling fans again, 2 customers were being helped. I thought \"I wonder how they got help? Maybe the employees are all queued up somewhere like cabs outside the airport, just waiting for \u00a0customer to engage them. I better find that magical place.\" I saw an orange apron passing by & asked if he could help me. I started with the ceiling fans. He told me I could purchase it & then they'd have an order written up to have somone come out to quote me for installation. I pointed out that the installation prices are posted, to which he said \"Well they have to come out & quote you.\" Whatever. He took me to their \"lead generater.\" OMG. This guy. First of all, he was really odd. He was standing around at the popcorn machine with a bag in-hand, eagerly waiting for it to start popping. When the 1st guy told him what I needed, Lead handed him his empty popcorn bag and said \"Fine. Get me popcorn.\" He then proceeded to write up the lead in writing so unintelligible that I couldn't recognize my own phone number. He added eloquent notes such as \"their [sic] is an existing elec. source their [sic]\" amid the popcorn grease stains. After we were done, he sent me to the desk back at doors and windows to arrange for measuring & installation.After walking back & waiting for the one person who was back there to finish with other customers, I find he can only help with windows. He tells me he knows who can help me though, and I follow him...back to Lead! In spite of being the one who directed me back to the doors & windows section, he pulls my folded up and now somehow far greasier lead sheet out of his apron and adds notes to have someone \"mesure [sic]\" my door and tells me they will quote installation. I ask if they'll honor the posted installation special of $57. He says \"probably.\"I purchased nothing beause my experience with Lead left me very uncertain that anything would come of my visit to this store. I would not wonder long.

My son and I were in Home Depot in and around the appliances section today starting at about 9:30am. We were waiting on Rochelle, who we have worked with before on our purchase of a dishwasher. For the record I have no problem with Rochelle, rather she is a good employee and gives great customer service. We're it not for Rochelle, when the incident I am about to describe occurred I would have cancelled the aforementioned purchase. When my son and I arrived at the appliances section, Rochelle was busy with other clients. My son and I waited over thirty minutes for Rochelle to help us, as unfortunately she was the only employee available to assist us on a Saturday morning. During our wait my son was well-behaved not making a peep for anyone else to hear. During our wait, I actually asked Kurt if he could help us and he told me \"No, I only work counters, you will have to wait for the young lady over there\" as he pointed to Rochelle. Also during our wait, I witnessed Kurt, anger a customer before me. There was a 35ish year old male customer waiting for assistance and Kurt very sarcastically yelled across an aisle of appliances, \" what the matter, why are you standing over there frowning?\" When the customer told him he wasn't frowning but he was frustrated and trying to get some assistance Kurt told him that all representatives were tied up and that he would have to wait, but that he should stop frowning. This, reasonably upset the customer and the customer asked Kurt to Call a manager. Kurt refused to do so and told the customer to walk to the front of the store, go to the customer service desk and request a manager. The customer, again asked Kurt to call a manager and Kurt simply told him \"No, go to customer service.\" The customer stormed off and I did not see him again.Several minutes after this, Rochelle had finished with her customers and was able to assist me. I sat down at her kiosk and started to work on my order with her. While we were working together and I was simultaneously attempting to keep my 2.5 year old son entertained and content, my son began to do some toddler screaming. This went on for about 1 minute as I was telling my son to stop screaming and attempting to pull out my phone and put on a \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,\" which for my 2.5 year old is the ultimate pacifier. While, I was in the process of doing so, Kurt, from the adjacent cubicle, stands up half way looks at my son and literally shouts, \"Young man, you need to keep quiet down there!\" This Home Depot employee spoke yelled at my son in a much louder tone than I have ever taken with him and I saw my son's chin crumple and quiver immediately. Any parent recognizes that toddler facial expression of shock and fright.Instantly, I felt my blood boil, and contemplated, canceling my order, and storming out with my son. I took a deep breath, handed my son my phone with his Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and attempted to calm down. I knew if I reacted immediately and answered Home Depot employee Kurt, it would not be a very fatherly exhibition for my son. So, instead I calmly apologized to my son for this ignorant, insensitive, and unprofessional behavior in a man of perhaps 60 years of age.Rochelle and I exchanged glances and told her that after my transaction was complete I would like this Home Depot employee's name and that I would like to speak with a manager. Rochelle agreed, and told me that Kurt's behavior was, \"not cool\" and she apologized for him. After my transaction I spoke with a woman named Ashley who stated that she was a supervisor and that she was very sorry for my experience and that she would speak with Kurt. I did in the same conversation tell Ashley that I was pleased with Rochelle and that Rochelle was the only reason I didn't cancel my over $700 order.After speaking with Ashley I decided that I couldn't leave Kurt actions unanswered so I pushed my cart back over to Kurt's counters department and very directly interrupted him and the customer ( same customer he was working with when he decided that my son was his to teach manners to). I told Kurt that not only was he out of line by speaking to my child in a raised voice but that he was also extremely unprofessional. Kurt countered my commentary by stating that this was a place of business and that he was unable to concentrate over my son's screams. As he retorted, I cut him off and told him that I was not going to debate his unprofessionalism.I expect a response from Home Depot and for action to be taken on this employee who yelled at my shopping cart bound 2.5 year old son.

They were both very tasty and had good crust. Not many pizza places in Chicago have BBQ chicken pizza, and for $7.99, this is a good option. One issue I do have with Domino's is their online pizza tracker, which is supposed to show where your pizza is at various stages, like prep, baking and delivery. The last two times we ordered pizza, the tracker said the pizza had been delivered and that we should be eating it, when we hadn't even received it yet. The tracker is a cool idea, but unless Domino's can make some strides to improve its accuracy, I think they should stop making it available to customers. It was just really annoying to see the tracker be like, \"Your pizza is here! Yum!\" and we're like, \"Ah ... no it's not\" and trying to look out the window to spot the Domino's car.

I can only think one thing: cheat day, yay! I noticed you have to be careful with ordering fast food from major chains in the city. Seems like the level of accountability sinks. Since I had my coupon, I didn't care. I have ordered from this location in the past, and what I am talking about here is a lack of cheese. You go to any Domino's in the suburbs and there is an ample amount. I was already out, so I picked up my pizza. After getting yelled at by a delivery guy (not Domino's) for not tipping enough, I decided it was less stressful to just pick up the food. Plus I am not tipping a driver to deliver me an overpriced pizza. I'm not ruining my 50% off by having to tip either. Yeah I am stingy, but after such a sour past experience, I will never tip another delivery person. Whether I was tipping enough at the time or not.For $7 bucks I got extra cheese, pineapple, and bacon. I think I made the workers nervous because I got there so quickly that they felt like they had to rush with my order. I was happy because my pizza wasn't over cooked. When you don't eat a ton of fast food, you taste everything that's amazing about it. In this case, butter and garlic on the crust, the comforting creamy flavor of the cheese, salty chewy bacon, and sweet pineapple. It was heaven. Domino's had just opened and I'm pretty sure I was one of the first pizza orders of the day. I think this is also why my pizza tasted so fresh, textured (crispy/soft crust), and full of flavor dimensions. The staff was polite for all of the three minutes I had to wait for my pizza.

I spend far too little time here and the cluster of businesses and facades just seem so... homey to me. This strip is perfect for a slightly nippy fall day. Or, at least according to all the crazy in my brain. While I wouldn't go to Dal Paeng over some of my other Korean go-tos, I would definitely stop in if in the neighborhood. Everything's done family-style, so get ready to eat up. Bring the stretchy pants. The banchan was acceptable. Nothing blew me away by nothing was horrible. For some reason, our group was treated to fish patties and sauteed fish (with bones. Salt & pepper?) on the house. It was an unexpected treat. The bones didn't make me wanna dance with somebody but the fish patties were very good. I'd go back and order them without any hesitation.Being me, I over-ordered. I came hungry and didn't think the portion size would fill me up, so I ordered the stir-fried squid and the kimchi pork. This was a mistake. Order one or the other, but do not think you can take down both. You can't. I have a pregnant belly (hmm, why am I single?) and it was too much for me. But, the taste wasn't too much for me. Both dishes were fantastic. The squid was spicy hot, plentiful, perfectly cooked (no chewy tentacles here) and. when accompanied with the rice, was the start of the show. I am fairly certain that everyone at my table was pretty jealous of my meal... and that's just how I like things to be. All eyes on me, bee-yatches! The kimchi pork was a little different than I expected. It was served as a HOT soup with kimchi broth and pork pieces. The broth was (surprisingly) under-seasoned. The pork was well-cooked and seemed to have soaked up all the seasoning of the kimchi. As a result, I concentrated on eating the protein and left the soup be. But, it could be because I was stuffed and my palate was wrecked from the squid. Nah. It was a seasoning issue. I think. In any case, I'd order it again, if that tells you anything -- but it would be on a chilly day and without an order of squid in my belly. Barley tea was the drink of choice (necessity?) that day and it did the job. I am a tea guy but barley tea is an acquired taste. I thought it nicely complimented the food and my glass (yes, glass. No cups) never went down by more than half. The proprietors were friendly and very accommodating to our, sometimes, boisterous crew and that was greatly appreciated.Fall is coming.

As a cashier at this store, I am going to be as honest as a customer.Last summer our store has undergone quite a big remodel. New flooring, new lighting, new furniture, bigger organic and produce and sushi selection, more baked goods, a little more of everything. The only downside was that most of the products had to be rearranged and the regular customers are dissatisfied now that the aisle that they turn to to get a specific item is in a different area.When I first started as a bagger, I did everything in my job list and more. It was not required but I'm that type of person to make customers happy. The baggers that use to work there didn't perform that well. They either quit or got fired. Those that remained and those that got hired recently are the best I've seen so far. We not only bag your groceries according to your needs, but we also help you put it on the conveyor belt to be rung up, and would have no problem with double bagging and helping you to your car. We have no problems with using your own bags, as a matter of fact we encourage you! My old supervisor told me that we, along with all of the Jewel stores, lose thousands of dollars just on plastic bags each month. And when we lose money, we lose working hours. Because of this as well as stolen and broken items, our hours are recently cut done 50%. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why we don't have a lot of baggers as we use to during the busy hours.The best time to shop is early mornings and nights, or at least before 11am and after 5pm. It can get really busy! I'm sorry that lines are long, and that you can't buy liquor before 11am on Sundays. I've gotten yelled at by customers because of this and I almost cried. They can be very discriminating against my young appearance and race. I've gotten customers who wouldn't listen to me and kept going against my words, and when I had my boss to come over and explain the same exact thing, they stopped complaining. I stand correctly. If I am unsure of some things, I tell you straight up of my uncertainties and would gladly have either my supervisors or boss to help you instead. \u00a0One time a customer yelled at me because he grabbed a medicine that was placed in the wrong area. When I told him that this is the wrong medicine, he became furious and demanded a cheaper value. I was very patient with him, didn't give him an attitude, and nicely told him that he took the wrong one and yet he yelled that it was for his son [who was apparently waiting in the car alone]. I'm sorry but wouldn't you buy it for your loved one even if it was a dollar more? This customer left and called me a b*tch. That was definitely uncalled for. This is probably the only bad experience I had with a customer.The comments about how expensive our products is, don't listen to them. They're just buying the items that are either not on sale or of brand-name. And when they are on sale, they're definitely a bargain. When I go shopping, I always buy the groceries that are on sale and wait for the ones that I want to go on sale next time. Aren't all grocery stores like this?I'm the only short asian girl cashier who looks like 18 but I have the liquor licence to override liquor. The best part about this is not waiting for someone older to ring up the liquor; and if I'm waiting, the customer will too. I'm faster than the cash registers, no joke; and when I'm working at the self-check-out lanes, I speedwalk/run to you, not walk. I don't know why I always do this. I just feel the need to service customers like a superwoman. I'm always smiling, express my greetings and farewells, playing and making your babies and kids laugh, curious about how you are and how's your day going, very fast productive, and idk what else to show off besides my face being in one of the employee-of-the-month wall ;)But if you have a problem, don't leave without us helping you. This is where most of our bad ratings come from. Customers walk out the store unhappy about something that we are unaware of. Sometimes we can't tell if you're really mad inside while you're expressing yourself oppositely. And sometimes we don' t know how you want us to bag your groceries according to your individual needs, and you let us continue because you don't say anything. So if you let us know your thoughts and opinions, we will do our best to deliver and make right.I give this store and all other Jewels a 4-star.

I pretty much put my share of bulgogi in the provided soup, along with a bunch of kimchi (3 kinds), mushrooms, other vegetables, rice, and dried fish.The woman who served us was really nice and spoke fine English. They now have printed menus. The first few pages are in Korean but the last page is in English. It includes all the favorites (kalbi, bulgogi, some soups, etc.) but it still helps to read Korean for the things not included on this one page. You can always ask if you don't know what to order. As usual, you have to buy 2 orders of kalbi or bulgogi to cook at the table but the prices are reasonable to do so.This time KBC was playing on the TV. KBC is the local Korean TV staion and features a lot of subtitles shows. This place stays open late (we haven't even been there before midnight). It may not be 24 hours but I would take this over San Soo Gab San any day (or night).[Note: The restaurant's name is wrong. The photo is correct.

A friend told me he had discovered them and so I sat down on the little 50's style counter (back before they added the dining room) and wondered what I was getting into. OMG. Spicy al pastor pork and fresh jalapenos dance in your mouth with pineapples, embraced by melted cheese. The bread holds this fine mess together valiantly. Spicy, not too sweet, flavorful! And so satisfying. Have it with some guacamole. Hands down some of the best I have had in a restaurant. You watch them cut it up and make it in front of you. Even the chips are deep fried in the moment. How sexy is that? Hooyah!But I don't want Mexican tonight? PIZZA, says you? This isn't Pizza Hut prices, but the pizzas are tasty and cooked perfect. Cheesy, not skimpy on ingredients, nice thickness and doughiness, ugh- I'm hungry just thinking about it. Also, very prompt with delivery. Where else can you get amazing pizza *and* guacamole delivered to you? Edit: The pizza that rotates is kinda sad. Don't order that one, it is no indicator of what they can do. Their fresh pizzas are where all the magic is. Their sopes are also pretty filling with a crunchy base and lots of stuff on top for your belly, the chile relleno dinner is a simple and hearty option I enjoy, but objectively, I know the quality does not rival my other favorites.

Typically, I'll stay especially since I've already had some misses so I go for the hits whenever possible.The hits: the clams, mussels, the peel yourself shrimp, whatever the fish of the day is, hot and sour soup and glass noodles. I'm typically satisfied with those items when available or I make do with whatever looks OK. I try to take tiny samples of different foods and usually, a small bite will help me decide if it's worth the calories and if it is, I head back up with a fresh plate and refill with the items that are tasty.The misses: most of everything else.It's a China Buffet for crying out loud. My expectations are not very high but I do think it's one of the better buffets in the greater Chicagoland area.

The inside was a little better, but you exchange the beer bottles and trash for a greasy atmosphere. When walking around the buffet area, I found the floors to be sticky. Some of the serving spoons were extremely greasy. A lot of the food looked like it had been sitting for more than half the day. The drinks were nasty.

For an Italian restaurant, they don't know how to cook pasta or decent Italian food. FAIL! I had the stuffed gnocchi, don't order it! It tasted bad where I didn't even want to eat my left overs. The second time I tried the Ahi Tuna which was surprisingly really good. The third time I had the Ahi Tuna again, but it was overcooked, did not taste good, the outside was pan burnt, and the green beans tasted like they were frozen vegetables. My what is suppose to be raw tuna, came out as medium cooked tuna. FAIL. Other guests at my table also complained the pasta was disgusting and undercooked. Another person found \"stones\" in the seafood pasta. The chef also drenches food in olive oil or butter sauces. They definitely need a new chef or better training. The food is WAY OVERPRICED for horribly poor quality food. Service:The older lady server is not friendly. She has this \"I'm better than you and don't want to serve you\" smug attitude. You can tell at times she tries to be nice, but the forced fakeness is extremely obvious. We all got a really bad and negative vibe from her. The male owner on the other hand was very nice and outgoing when he served our table. Cleanliness:FULL BOTTOM LIP LIPSTICK ON GLASSWARE. Enough said!! Negligence to clean and check glassware before placement is a major FAIL. On top of that, the menus are all dirty with crumbs all over them. For a place that is often empty or not very busy, they sure do neglect simple cleaning duties. This causes a red flag for me about the cleanliness behind kitchen doors. The banquet hall looks nice.

The ambiance definitely isn't intimate or upscale, but more of a casual setting. There are tatami rooms but I've never seen anyone occupying them. Service is good - the Korean owner is always very gregarious. Water is refilled regularly, you get a warm towel to begin, fresh fruit to end your meal. Food. Midori takes the Korean tradition of many small appetizer plates by offering a pickled cucumber plate as well as a green bean and mushroom plate that is drizzled with an incredible hot chili sauce. Also bucking common American Japanese restaurants where you can only pick one of either miso soup or salad, Midori gives you both. The age tofu as an appetizer is a must-have. The breading is not too thick and the sauce gives the perfect balance between sweet and savory.For my main course, I ordered the chirarshi - Japanese style. The Korean version has the sashimi chopped instead. The fish is fresh, you get a wide variety, the size of the fish is generous, presentation is beautiful. My only complaint is the amount of rice -- I couldn't finish my rice given the amount of fish. The rolls here are great as well. A wide selection of specialty rolls and good values. My one wish would be that they have different boat options. They offer sashimi plates and sushi plates, but no boat for (2,3,4,etc) that is commonly offered at other sushi restaurants.

I tried a tuna roll and some shrimp tempura roll that had a few slices of cucumber, a ton of rice, adorned with avocado on the top. It was so average. Nothing special.

It came with a side of rice and a lot of tempura. The tempura was good, but the beef wasn't very tasty IMHO. It was more like Korean bulgogi; I'm not a big fan of bulgogi.

As in I dined here when they still had the fishbowl in the wall. The food's always okay and service is always okay, but I had a loyalty, I used to come here with my grandparents. My recent visit was absolutely disappointing. Yesterday was Mother's day and I'll give it to them, they were busy, but not people waiting around busy, tables filled busy. We DID attempt to make reservations earlier in the day and we were declined the opportunity since our party was not 6 or more guests. We were 5, four adults, one child. As we entered, the host asked how many and then asked if we had reservations (tables were open, along with the many private rooms). I explained to her that we had tried, but were not able to. Then she asked if I, a woman, was Jeff. I said no. Moments later a family entered behind us. The host asked if he was Jeff, he was and they sat \u00a0his family, 3 kids and 2 adults at a table for 6. The host then came to me and asked again how many. As they cleared another table, the waitress asked the family (Jeff) they just sat if they would move! And the wife annoyed agreed, they seated them at a table for four! But worse sat us at their previous table! So there was a show from the moment we walked into this small restaurant. And it only got worse. We each ordered entrees and received the bare minimum vegetable appetizer amenities that are normally included with each entree. \u00a0Parts of it were missing and the cucumbers and green beans were scarce. Most unfortunately because this, along with the salad is my favorite part of the meal. We were not given warmed towels to cleanse our hands before the meal. This is a normal routine at this restaurant. No big deal, maybe they don't do it anymore. Nope, two other tables were brought them. We barely saw our waitress. No refills on water. But the worst to come. Once we did see our waitress, she was there to clear plates. Clear plates we were still eating off of. I made it clear myself and my daughter were still eating and not to remove the plates. Meanwhile she sat another family of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults, at the table across from us, set for 4. She clearly stated to them. You can wait until \"they\" (us) are done and sit there. She came back not 5 minutes later and tried to take my bowl of Soba, I stated a few more minutes please. She then said \"Ok, but I'm bringing you the check\". My sister then informed her we were going to order desert, but we would pass since she is rushing us out of here. All while the other family seated sat with there with menus in their lap, turning around waiting to see if we were done eating. \u00a0Because, this woman told them to wait for us. When the woman came back with the check she cleared our plates and served us some complimentary oranges (you get them all of the time) all with the underlying message of, Hurry up order, Hurry up spend money, Hurry up and get out!

We just tried some basic maki's(Spicy tuna/Salmon, california, negi hamachi, and some veggie rolls). They were all delicious and simple. The fish was generous and the rice was perfect.

The doctor was friendly and cheerful... and efficient! Turns out, my crappy extension of my lenses did zero damage to my eyes and everything checked out a-ok. I ordered a new supply all covered by my insurance, paid my copay and was on my way. The whole experience took less than 30 minutes.

In that time the event staff that we were working with turned over three times! On the third time we met with Shelby. What was frustrating was that everything that we agreed to with the two previous event staff was MIA and we had to go over everything for a third time. Also, some of the things that were pre-negotiated were null and void even with a signed contract - such BS! Also, Shelby asked who our caterer is. We told her and she said \"I'm not famililar with that one.\" It annoyed the heck out of me because I said that we got that vendor from your preferred list. Don't you think you'd get to learn who the vendors are on your preferred list instead of looking at the customer like we have eight heads???Within three weeks prior to our wedding, I contacted Shelby for a face to face meeting to go over everything. During that meeting I met Natalie. Now this is person #4 that we have met during this process. \u00a0It was confusing working with these two because I was told that Natalie would be the person who I work with for my wedding. Any questions I have can go to her. However, Shelby often responded to my questions. I wanted to make sure that whatever answers Shelby was giving to me was shared with Natalie so that nothing fell through the cracks. The day of the wedding, my \"day of\" person checked out the space about 90 min prior to our ceremony. Our ceremony was held in the Fifth Province across from the bar side. The riser, which is in green carpeting, was filthy. My day of person asked to have it vacuumed. Then she went up stairs and saw how filthy the floor was in the Erin room where our reception was to be held. She had to request that both the riser and the floor be swept and cleaned. If she hadn't seen that or said anything, it would have been a filthy mess. The brides room - ick! It's bascially a bathroom with two stalls and a sink. The sink had dead bugs all over it and a towel hanging with some questionable white gunk on it. Really? This is how you present this to brides the day of? So gross! Brides, this is a huge day in your life. If you have a wedding coordinator, then you might do ok having your wedding here. Otherwise, if you are on your own like I was, then consider going somewhere else to have your wedding. You will get very limited help from the event staff here. They can't even make sure the rooms you rented are clean. Just awful! They did meet our request to open the bar an hour earlier than normal and set-up a podium for our ceremony.

A group of four of us, who work at a local school, decided to change up our lunch routine. We thought we would support local business and try Merla's. Merla's Kitchen catered a teacher appreciation lunch last year, and we remembered enjoying the food and thought it was time to check out the actual restaurant. I called waaaaay in advance to find out more about their menu, since there was no official website/menu. I thought it was weird that they offered beef, ham, and tofu empanadas, but not chicken. I found out that they DO, in fact, have chicken empanadas and that I would need to call an hour in advance to have our food ready. An hour ahead of time seemed a little excessive, but we were on a time crunch in between classes, so I took her advice and made sure to order an hour before we arrived. When I did call to make the order, I asked about the empanada platter I saw listed on the internet ($6.19) and wondered if we could sub out the steamed rice for fried rice. The girl told me that was no problem and asked what time we would be there, I told her and I said I was looking forward to it. I also asked how much it would be per person, and she told me $10.91. I thought that was a little steep, but I assumed that the prices online were extremely outdated. We show up to find a quaint, little shop that had a few diners in there. Good sign...not completely empty during lunch time and even a little kid was eating his food, and enjoying it. I let the one lady, that we saw, know that we pre-ordered our meals and she never really responded, but I assumed she was pretty busy, especially since she was power walking back and forth getting things ready. After about 5 minutes, our server arrives with 4 bowls of soup, chicken broth with some vegetables. We didn't realized soup came with our meal, so we we pleasantly surprised. The soup was a little greasy, but a nice gesture/ start the meal. We did have to ask for water, since no one offered us any beverages. Not 1 minute later, out comes our food. We all ordered the empanada platter...half of us got veggie/tofu and the other half chicken. The plate of food was very large, with two large empanadas, a side salad made up of mostly napa cabbage and a drizzle of dressing, and a serving of rice. I noticed right away that the rice was very white and I let her know, that we actually ordered fried rice. She informed me that I never told her what to fry up the rice with, so they just did oil and garlic. Whaaaaat? At this point I didn't want to seem rude or ignorant, especially since I never dined at this restaurant before, but usually fried rice has SOMETHING in it and doesn't just taste like plain, boring, white rice. We dig in, everything is tasting fine, but the boring rice. I dump the rice into the chicken soup just to add some sort of flavor to it. It really was a large portion of food, most of the ladies packed up their second empanada and it was time for the check. She handed the check over, with zero warning, and it read $52.79....EXSQUEEZE ME?So, we where charged $9.99 per platter. Then they deducted 50 cents per person for NOT getting white rice....but then charged us $2.79 (or something close-they kept the original receipt) for fried rice. WHAT fried rice????I thought there most have been some misunderstanding, so I bring up the receipt to her and said that the bill is much higher than we expected. \"Oh yeah, I told you the wrong price on the phone\"....oooookkkkaaaaayyy. So, I then calmly continue and just mention that we called ahead of time on purpose so we were prepared and we are trying to support local businesses...and it was falling on deaf ears. Rice costs pennies....and for a business to charge almost $3 for a cup of rice...with some oil on it seemed like highway robbery.Since I recommended the place, I was too embarrassed to ask my co-workers to start scraping our money together to have enough for the bill and tip, so I quickly paid with my credit card just so I could leave.

I added hot pepper flakes to enhance the meal, something I would not need to do at Mayflower. However, their fried rice was better than I've had anywhere in a long time. Little bits of chicken mixed in throughout gave it excellent flavor too. Egg roll was decent, but not superb.I ate about one-third of the package before I was full.

She applied for a tourist visa with her husband but they refused to let him travel with her because they feared they wouldn't return.The Berlin Wall was still up in 1988 and times were tough. If you complained about meat being overcooked, my grandpa, who fought in WWII would say, \"It's tougher where there isn't any!\" Well, as a satellite state of the Soviet Union, there really wasn't jack shit in the GDR. They were supposedly a Demokratische Republik but communism had them in an iron curtain chokehold.It was abundantly apparent how cut off they were from the rest of the civilized world if you took a tour of their grocery stores. Shortages of what we'd consider easily accessible goods were the norm and there was little to no variety because of the government's refusal to import. After standing in long lines, you pretty much had to take what you could get, and that was assuming there was anything left to be given.While my cousin was in town, my aunt showed her around. A regular grocery store wasn't on the list of American attractions to familiarize her with, but it's one place they happened to stop and she wept when she saw all the choices. My mom joked it was a good thing she hadn't taken her to Byerly's because she probably would have completely lost it in an upscale supermarket that boasts live lobsters and carpeted floors.I'm here to say that it's a far better thing we didn't have an \"in\" with Restaurant Depot / Jetro Cash & Carry at the time because Jutta most definitely would have had a \"Moscow on the Hudson\" style breakdown of epic proportions (myspace.com/youremembert\u2026).Granted, there might not be as many brands as you'd find in conventional shops, but just about everything is sold in bulk and the place is packed with row after row of top to bottom shelving stocked with candies, canned goods, whole animals, jugs of cooking oils and spices, giant containers of condiments, and perhaps the epitome of capitalism, Coca-Cola by the case.

Items are relatively easy to locate, but the checkout line can be a hassle. The cashiers ring everything up and often times there's some type of pricing error that needs to be fixed and/or they make you wait for a security person to count out the items individually.

I have mixed feelings about this place i , because the setting and wait staff does the food no justice... First of I am not Filipino but my boyfriend is and he cooks for me about 3 times a week so most of the foods there i have ate before, I am Hispanic so I recognize most ingredients used. We like to go out to restaurants on Fridays, especially places the other has not been to. So of course he picked this place. He said he has always gone here with his family and they used to be at another location. He gave it great reviews.. so I was excited to go and eat Filipino food which i love.. When we first walked in I was surprised to see that it was extremely quiet for a Friday evening. we basically seated ourselves because the waitstaff that consisted of 3 men were busy with other things (reading a newspaper). It seems to only be staffed by a grandfather, father and son. I didn't pay much attention to that cause I got a homey feeling to the place. I started to absorb my surroundings and noticed that it looked kind of tacky inside for example they had Christmas lights up, plastic table covers, fake flowers on the tables. So I asked my bf where was the menu he stated we were going to do the buffet and i asked \"so do we just go up there or do we wait for a waiter?\" all this dyi atmosphere was kind of awkward cause the staff would just glance our way. He said \"yeah lets just go get our plates and eat.\" It would've been nice to at least be told by a waiter that we had the option to a menu or buffet then at least point us in the direction to the buffet. When we got to the buffet it was pretty stocked everything was full which i thought OK thats good but when i got closer i noticed that some food looked like it was sitting there a while due to the coagulation of the sauces. after I helped myself to 3 different kinds of pork dishes, and some plain rice and a veggie roll, I sat to eat. The menudo dish was excellent the rest of the food was good kind of warm not hot enough the rice was OK. the veggie roll was great i got another one the second time i went up to get my lechon..The lechon was cold and the pork skewers were ice cold. During the meal we didn't get refills of water, we didn't get waited on at all and the limited staff was doing a bad job of keeping up with people that were starting to fill in for dinner. I told my bf that the food was good but the staff sucked and the ambiance was cold like the lechon, I didn't feel welcomed at all. Maybe they should hire some friendly women who actually smile. When we asked for our check they guy who brought it stood there until we handed it back! And he stood there staring at the ceiling, i think it was very rude he could've at least given us a chance to look at the total and let my bf get his wallet, he felt so rushed he just put a large bill and handed it right back. I thought maybe I just had high expectations but my bf also was getting frustrated with the staff and cold food.

It may still be their specialty, but we were very disappointed with ours, and I don't understand why this place has a four-star average. It really isn't good.It started out with a waitress who couldn't understand that Kenny O. wanted a large and spicy kimchi and pork tofu soup and that I wanted a small spicy seafood tofu soup. We got what we wanted, all right, but Kenny's tofu soup was the same size as mine, which meant that it was a small order as opposed to a large order.The first set of side dishes came out with the burnt rice. I didn't understand why they didn't just bring all of the side dishes at once, but that's a minor detail. The burnt rice was too burnt, if there's even such a thing. It was crispy to the point of dryness, and it tasted like old rice to me. Kenny described it as \"chewy.\" It was very unappealing. The kimchi cabbage and cucumbers were the only side dishes that I enjoyed. I didn't like the fish cakes, and I normally love that stuff. It just didn't have enough flavor; it was very bland in taste. I didn't particularly enjoyed the kimchi chives nor did I enjoy the potatoes (they were slightly sour). Then the worst part of all: the mackerel was too fishy. By this point, I felt a bit offended. They gave us expired fish? WTF...Back in California, I'm used to cracking my own egg over the boiling bowl of tofu soup and then mixing it all in. This isn't how they do it here at So Gong Dong though. It came out with the egg already in it, and my egg was a little more cooked than I would have liked. Kenny's was still runny. I was really disappointed. And sure, I like all the little baby oysters, mussels, shrimps, squid, and calamari that came with my soup but the soup in general was so bland that there was very little difference between Kenny's and mine.

Nothing that will let you down but nothing you will remember forever. Prices: For standard Chicago burgers and dogs this is on the more expensive end of the scale. I got a medium coke, Cheeseburger and Cheese Fries and ended up paying around 11 bucks.Customer Service: I have been here a few times and EACH time have had a routine customer service issue turned into a big-time production. Employees are often rude, incompetent and incapable of admitting wrongdoing. The restaurant fails the minimum standards of customer service, like listening to an order, getting it right, displaying contriteness and greeting people. All of the these experiences in this review are from inside the restaurant, so cruddy drive-thru microphones aren't an excuse for consistently screwing up an order. I also am a native English speaker, and have received worldwide renown, fame and monetary rewards for my diction.They screwed up my order on my first visit to the restaurant. It was a simple order of a burger and fries that mysteriously morphed into a hot dog and ice cream. This was not a mere mixup, as in something the other table ordered. Upon checking my receipt I saw that they showed me as having ordered a hot dog and ice cream; a combination that I am thoroughly opposed to on philosophical grounds. So the person taking the order failed in their basic task of BEING THE PERSON TAKING THE ORDER. Correcting the order was left up to me as the employees steadfastly insisted that I ordered what they said I did. (As a person who had worked in multiple restaurants I loathe making customer service complaints. I will not however eat hot dogs and ice cream. In public at least.) The next time, \u00a0I ordered a cappuccino. (Don't ask why but I did.) Instead I received a coke. Told them I did not order a cappuccino. They told me I ordered a coke. I corrected them. They tried to correct me. Wow. Finally, the owner came over. He was brusque, unapologetic and seemed as though he wanted me to apologize for wasting his time. Then they asked me to cough up more money for the cappuccino. Wow times two.This uninterrupted stream of incompetence happened again upon my next visit \u00a0only insert cheese fries for cappuccino. This third \u00a0time, I knew there was going to be trouble. Upon walking in the restaurant, the employee was disappointed at having to put down her smartphone. I must have interrupted an awesome snapchat session with that boy in Algebra who totally digs her for her brain. I approached the register. She stared blankly at me. I offered a hello, unsure anymore that I was actually in a business that served money for food. She then offered an annoyed hello that made me literally feel guilty. As I was ordering I noticed her attention wandering; she was failing to make any eye contact and actually began talking to other employees while I was ordering. Noticing this, I repeated my order THREE times; in plainly spoken English not in my usual morse code. Upon sitting down I discovered that, as I feared, she screwed up the order. I told the server that I had ordered cheese fries. She went back to the kitchen and came back out to tell me I had not. I told her I had. She then hurriedly went back to \"order\" the cheese. She brought out the cheese and then told me I owed an additional 2 dollars. I coughed it up (why I don't know) and she came out a third time to give me my change, which I had already told her to keep the second time. (It must be noted this person was nicer, if no more competent.)Summary: The employees are not schooled in the basics of customer service. I do not believe that asking an employee to say hello and listen to a customer's order is asking too much. I also do not believe it is too much to ask that upon discovering a problem; the employees should be contrite and act quickly to remedy the problem. I was only asking for the items I ordered. I was not asking for elaborate accommodations and specialty orders. Getting an order right is food service 101. (I know; \u00a0I've worked in multiple restaurants. I am well aware of what is normal baseline customer service and what is considered to be going above and beyond. I wouldn't call this passable service by any stretch.)Note: 1 bad employee is not enough for me to give a bad review, but when every person I encounter in three straight visits is either rude or incompetent I consider that to be endemic, not an outlier. Not only are the employees not schooled in being polite and getting an order right, they conduct themselves in a manner that says \"I don't give a blank and how dare you interrupt my day.\"", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 2, 10]}, "49": {"description": "Good place and the food is awesome.

This place is sort of like the service at Aldi's, little to no service for cheaper costs, only the experience is worst. Employees with visible tattoos definitely gave me even more of an added bad impression of this place. \u00a0At this point we can pretty much put a label on the types of people that are hired here at this location. Every time I call into this place I get an uneasy feeling and I shouldn't be feeling that way. It makes me definitely feel unwelcome, in which that's probably what the rude employees want for customers to feel. So customers would just stop coming so the employees here can just sit around and get paid.If that's what they want, don't give them what they want. Continue to go to this location, report all of your bad experiences. Something must be done about all of this, we cannot just give in and let these rude employees get their pay treating customers the way that they do. Rudeness is a sign of disrespect and with money coming out of our pockets. We shouldn't let these rude associates stay and get paid that easy. Note to management: I definitely recommend making your screening/background checks strict and very thorough for this location. If there are any notion of the individual not fitting in to the job. Please do not hold back and be lenient to let applicants work here. At this point, the place is 2 stars overall. May not be long till it reaches 1 star.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 7, 23]}, "2": {"description": "I'm getting older and my Eyes are going to hell in a hand basket. That leaves me with two choices. I can lug around reading glasses everywhere I go, or start wearing prescription glasses. I opted for the 2nd choice.  My Wife and I went to AB on a Sunday afternoon for an eye exam. They were crowded and I didn't have time to wait. No big deal. We looked through the selection of frames and picked out two pairs that my Wife and I could live with. We were told their system was down and they could only accept Cash. No problem. I was assured that their system would be back up the next day and I could use my Debit Card from my HSA account.  The next day I left work a little early to get my eye exam. When I entered the store there were a couple of angry looking customers complaining to the staff at the front register. I guess their system was still down from the previous day. The 12 year old at the counter told me the only way I could put a deposit down for my glasses and exam was to pay cash. That would negate the whole point of having a debit card from my health savings account now wouldn't it? At that point, I just turned around and left. \u00a0 Here's the bottom line: They should really call this place America's Worst. I'm more than willing to pay a few extra dollars to purchase my glasses from a store that's not completely FUBAR.

She asked if this prescription was for glasses or contacts. I told her I wore contacts but do not need any at the moment. So she wrote me 2 prescriptions. I was then directed to the Store Manager, I believe. He was \"friendly\" but reminded me of a used car salesman. I do not even know where to begin with this guy. Maybe it's because he told me i have astigmatism (I do not) or that my lenses would be really thick (they are not--at all!) and that i should shell out more money to get thinner lenses, or is it the fact that he scratched out the doctor's prescription for contacts, even though i told him i will be getting more contacts soon. ugh. but i think the worst thing he said was to my now-husband--\"you will look bad if you don't get the thinner lenses.\" i swear he said that!!!but my friends, it gets worse. when ordered, they told us it would be ready in 7 business days and they would call us when they were in. we placed our order 1 week and and half before the wedding, cutting it close. i wasn't sure if they would be ready in time, but we weren't sweating it. well, the day before our wedding and still no word. so i called and spoke to THE rudest woman ever. i explained the situation (that we were getting married the next day) and gave her both our names and asked her if our glasses were in. she said \"no.\" i asked her when she thought they would be in. \"7 - 10 business days.\" (ahhh this is the first i've heard 10 business days) i asked her what day that would be, about, and she gave me the SAME answer \"7 - 10 business days.\" she then decided to end the conversation and said \"we will call you when they are in.\" ok, whatever.DAY OF THE WEDDING: my husband tried calling the store for 2 hours but no answer. so he calls the customer service hotline, who (earned the 1 star) were very friendly, helpful, and sympathetic but delivered some bad news: one of his pairs of glasses were in (YAY!) and had been in since tuesday (what?????) but the store was closed because they had no power (understandable but still BOO). bummer.

She sat us down to see how they fit. My husband went first. She asked them how they fit and felt. They were clearly crooked and he told her so. She denied they were crooked, so i piped up and agreed they were, indeed crooked. She sighed and huffed and puffed and \"fixed\" them (not really, though). The next pair of his clearly did not fit him. The ear piece was clearly 1\" too short and was squeezing his head. She asked him how they felt and he told her. She brushed this off with \"they're plastic, they'll stretch.\" Ugh. I couldn't take it anymore, I said \"I'm sorry but you are asking us how they fit and we are telling you.\" She was very put off at that point and clearly did not want to do her job.

A total of 460 delicious calories. I used to do the Pick 2 (half sandwich and a soup). However, once I found out that the Broccoli and Cheddar had 16 grams of fat, I decided that this cannot be allowed anymore. Recently, I have tried the black bean soup, it is absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, they do not have nutritional information on this particular soup, I even checked online to make sure. Lately, I've been doing the pick 2 with this soup, but next time I visit the place, I won't buy it again until I know what I'm eating. I give this place a 4, because ever treat that I have bought from them has not met my expectations of deliciousness. It's not like I get treats often, but when I do, if I going to commit the crime of eating junkfood, it better be worth the taste. Panera falls short on this note.Last but not least, the staff has always been friendly to me. I will say that the reward program kinda sucks. I always get rewards for drinks or for discounts off drinks. Perhaps Panera thinks they can sucker me into buying a drink if they give me a discount, not the case, I only drink water and an occasional milk. It's funny how they try to market me an item that I obviously never buy. That said, I guess I won't buy a treat for a while. Maybe the system will realize, \"Oh look....this guy does't buy treats, maybe if we offer him a reward on one he'll be hooked to always buy one with his meal in the future.\" Anyways, I don't hold anything against Panera for having a lame reward system.

Their menu has variety whether you want to dine in for ramen or sandwiches. There is also bingsoo and many drink options.

However, he said the place only carried almond & whole milk. It didn't really make sense to me because that means they're making their lattes out of whole milk or drinks etc. In my opinion, that is not very accommodating to your customers which I was disappointed about. The drinks were mediocre. The green tea milkshake was way too heavy for my liking, and it tasted like milk more than the actual matcha flavor (which is why I wanted to opt out of the whole milk option).

Just when I feel like I've tried everything here already, they seem to pull something new, whether it be desserts or drinks. While the food is nothing to really write home about; the portions on some of the desserts are huge, the staff is usually very accommodating, and the place is a very soothing/relaxing place to chill/have a conversation/play board games. Here are the items I've tried.Red Bean Bingsoo - I think this is probably what I have had the most here, and it's usually someone else's choice. I'm not a big fan of the red bean they use, and usually eat around it. But the ice cream, mochi, and fruit make it still a solid choice. Fruit Bingsoo - my favorite of the Bingsoos. Remove the red bean and add more fruit! Problem solved. Banana split - this thing is massive. Definitely something to be shared (especially after a meal prior to this). A mountain of chocolate, \u00a0vanilla, and strawberry icecream and a ton of whipped cream. It's awesome, but not quite as good as...Red bean ice cream sundae - also massive like the banana split, but this one has red bean, green tea, and vanilla ice cream toppled with delicious mochi. Probably my favorite dessert here. Even if I have to eat around the red bean (you could also tell them not to pour that on too...). Raspberry Cheesecake - took a few bites, didn't really think much about it.Pineapple sorbet - it was pretty good, but it wasn't something I would want to order again, considering the other options.Chocolate Fondue - it was definitely cool to have that little set come out and dip various things into the chocolate. \u00a0But I would say it was more of a one time thing. It wasn't really worth it, and was more fun than tasty. I've also tried various drinks and they have varied from good to bad. But, \u00a0I find their regular Latte very consistent and passable. So that is usually my go to. Overall, the rating is more based on the ability to come in after a meal to extend the night (without going somewhere loud and expensive). It's a great place to chill and drink a coffee or have an after dinner dessert. It's also a great place to get your ice cream fix in the heat of summer (it'll fix you good).

Nonetheless, you will definitely get your money's worth. The environment that they provide nurtures a friendly, cozy, and comfortable place to be. It makes you feel at home while enjoying food and bubble tea with friends and family. The board games and cards add to that fun mix. Lastly, I respect the customer service for they always are willing to cater to you. The owner and workers are always attentive to their customers.

When I got the double green tea latte I discovered it was made with the fake green tea bubble tea powder. Ugh. And they said I can only buy a double if I'm taking it to go because they only offer double to go cups. Why can't they put a single in a double cup? I don't know. Well, actually I do, it's called cheap. On the other hand the server with glasses was very nice and polite and apologized multiple times for forcing us to buy doubles.

There's no drive-thru lane, as it would mean no parking at all. I got there right at 11:30, before the usual lunch crowd shows up. Well, I was maybe in a line 8-10 people deep. In about 5 minutes, the line tripled in length. I noticed almost everyone in line had a printed coupon in hand. The few people who didn't must've felt stupid for showing up in the first place. It began to look like a ghetto soup kitchen on Thanksgiving Day... or a toy store at 5 AM on Black Friday. At KFC, I saw a school bus driver, a pair of CTA drivers, cops, heating/AC repair guys, college-age kids and even a homeless-looking guy with a jar of lollipops for sale. All came for the freebie.Ironically, this store was not prepared for it. There was one person preparing food and 2 people working the counter. To alleviate their people shortage, they took a dozen orders at a time, then stopped the line to fill them. So it didn't matter if you were #1 or #12. You just waited with everyone else. They dished out the orders as a group and then took the next group and so on.Now the whole idea of this free chicken giveaway was to introduce people to this new chicken product or to bring back people like myself who stopped going to KFC long ago. I don't think they succeeded. I saw a few people walk out and go to Popeye's a half-mile away on Lincoln. Others crowded in and the line wrapped almost around the store by noon. It took me about 30 minutes to get my order. I felt sorry for the few paying customers who stuck it out. OK, so the 2 pieces of grilled chicken with the mashed potatoes, coleslaw & biscuit were a great freebie, but the workflow of this particular store was simply too chaotic and understaffed to move this group quickly enough. I doubt I'll be coming back, even when the giveaway is over.", "rating": "2", "date": [2009, 5, 8]}}, "neighborhoods": ["North Park"], "latitude": 41.9901, "longitude": -87.7131, "rating": "2.5", "times": {"Mon": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"], "Thu": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"], "Sat": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"], "Wed": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"], "Tue": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"], "Sun": ["10:30 am", "9:30 pm"], "Fri": ["10:30 am", "10:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Chicken Wings", "chicken_wings"], ["Fast Food", "hotdogs"]], "address": ["3357 W.

I never wanted to try it until today. Since I was at the nearby Kinko's, I walked over from to try May Flower for the first time. The restaurant is in the strip mall with the Jewel-Osco on the corner of Foster & Pulaski. Inside, it's rather plain and seems like it could be a little cleaner. A giant light box on the wall shows a photo of a huge Chinese temple. The chairs looked nicer than fast food restaurant seating, but seemed a bit dingy too. Otherwise, the interior of the place is pretty bare and it could use a paint job or facelift.I have established General Tso's chicken as my baseline standard for measuring Chinese food, ever since I had it at Dragon Inn. Lucky for me, they had it as one of their nearly 30 lunch combo specials. And since they had fresh fruit smoothies featured on their window, I thought I'd try one - strawberry.While I was there 2 other people came in to place orders or pick up phone orders. Then a whole family with kids walked in. And you know what... everybody ordered a smoothie too! It was delicious! A big, maybe 22 oz. cup of pureed strawberries with smoothly blended slush containing \u00a0shreds of real strawberries and tiny seeds, not sugary syrup and fake coloring mix. They also have pineapple, mango and banana among other flavors. Now this smoothie came with one heck of a sturdy straw too. It had to be almost 1/2-inch round and was made of a thicker plastic. Without explaining fluid dynamics theory I studied at Purdue, let's just say it maximizes smoothie throughput when you suck it down and keeps the straw from collapsing from the vacuum pressure.The meal came a few minutes later, heaping with chicken fried rice, an egg roll and my Tso's chicken. Nothing spectacular. I thought the sauce was a bit gummy and the flavor not quite as savory as I've had elsewhere. Still, the serving size was huge and I didn't eat that much before I felt full. I had quite a bit left over for later.If anything, I'm definitely coming back for more smoothies at this place.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 4, 18]}, "29": {"description": "Really good chinese food. note, \u00a0the people working there are pretty rude though.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 10, 18]}, "42": {"description": "We use to live in the neighborhood and we ordered almost weekly Hunan Spicy Chicken from this restaurant. \u00a0Al large portion is big enough for two.

The little white boxes are filled well beyond capacity and there are so many shrimp in an order of Shrimp Fried Rice, that you'd tire of counting if you were so inclined.

Felt more like what one would imagine being served in a soup kitchen or something. I ended up taking most of it home and picked at it for supper. I also got a beef enpanada. The crust tasted like a type of corn bread and was rather sweet. I liked that a little better. Also bought some bread rolls I have yet to try. The place is very clean and the lady behind the counter was friendly. I wish I could say I am eager to try it again, but I think it will be a while before I return.

Great sandwiches can be delicate, gut-busting, humble or flashy. What they have in common is that they're built with love and care and great quality ingredients. This is exactly what Bari's Deli has created for several decades. If you landed here, it means you are searching for a fantastic sub sandwich in Chicago. Yeah, yeah, bada-bing bada-boom-boom, you found it so look no further, because this joint is number one when it comes to subs. We love the made-to-order deli sandwiches. Picking just one of their masterpieces at this deli shop is no easy task, since every massive mound of bread, meat, and cheese here is nothing short of a Chicago treasure. Years ago, I tried the prosciutto, sopressata comprised of fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers and olive oil -- simply memorable -- fresh, chewy bread melds perfectly with the cold cuts and cheese. The savory olive spread adds an extra kick to the whole she-bang. We were astounded by the carniv-orgasmic offerings at this place when we first \u00a0came here over 10 years ago!You can try ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, mortadella with American, Swiss or provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, mustard, mayo, oil and vinegar, all packed on a fresh, fluffy Italian bread. The bread is simply ethereal. There are lots of solid options to choose from at this joint, which prides itself on creating sandwiches to satisfy every palette. Thick Italian bread envelops plump pieces of their meatballs, all elegantly smothered in delectable fresh mozzarella, Romano cheese and piping hot tomato sauce. Afterward, you can nap for weeks, awake refreshed (and five pounds heavier). My favorite sandwich here is their Italian sub (or Italian hero). If you want to have the gastronomical experience of a sub sandwich life time hit this place up for lunch.There is only one thing you need to know about this joint. What dat? What dat? The Italian sub is the one you want. Don't think twice! Just order it and step back. Let the man work his magic, while you marvel at the quick dance of sandwich seduction happening before your eyes. First, a long loaf of Italian bread is sliced open and fresh cured meat after cured meat thinly shaved goes directly into the sandwich. At this point, your mouth is watering as cheeses, peppers, dressing, everything, added so deftly that if you blink you might miss a step. Second, hold your wrapped sandwich tightly in your hands and try not to quiver with excitement at first bite!This mom and pop operation has been serving fantastic Italian sausage, Sub sandwiches and Italian beef for decades. I wouldn't say they have \"the best\" Italian beef in the city, but it is definitely worth trying (even if it is only once). This is carry-out only, so get your sandwich and get the hell out. \u00a0Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom.

They serve up flavorful meats and cheeses, and I've never had any complaints over the bread (though I tend to like my sammies on a chewier roll). My boyfriend and I almost always get a sub for now and one for later. A+ for service. We ordered two 3 footers for a Super Bowl party to be picked up just before they closed that day (I believe around 4 pm). By 11:30 that morning, the snow was laying it on thick. We called to see if it was possible to move up pick up so we could get over there and get back before the roads were too nasty.

Bari has delicious subs that are large in size and affordable. This almost reminds me of a place where Tony Soprano would come for some great gabagool. I usually either get the 12 inch Italian or Meatball sub. One thing to note is their bread is flaky and a little tougher than your normal soft sub bread. I prefer it this way, but I can see how some people would not like the texture if they are used to soft bread. One word of advice is to call-in ahead of time to place your order. If you go on the weekends you could be waiting in line for 20 minutes or more compared to walking in and getting your sub right away.

If you are an avid customer of Baskin Robbins you know that each location is different in so many ways. Customer service is never the same and whether we are talking about ice cream or how something simple like a sundae is created, its always different and that in itself is well... nuts. One of my biggest peeves about this location are the charges. One time I was here for the 99 cent scoop promo, the cashier pressed 99 buttons and when he was done I was overcharged. I showed him the flier I received and the cost I was to pay, he argued that their location charges different. Okay, whatever; makes no sense when you have the same advertising in-store stating the price of a cone with a scoop. During another promotion I went through the drive-thru. I must've had the same luck because I think it was the same associate, again overcharged and given some illogical explanation. I took a photo of the receipt which I don't have near me to post on Yelp, but it shows that I was charged a miscellaneous cost and given a discount but still the final price higher than the promotion charge. WTF. All of these pricing problems on top of the inability of some store employees in understanding simple ice cream orders.. equals sucky visits. The parking lot, who designed this space?

I've experienced better\" which is exactly how I felt when I was eating this food. I'm not sure if the owners are Arab, but the food tastes more Indian than it does Arab.The first time I ordered from here I had the chicken shawerma platter (came with rice and a salad), and beef shawerma wrap. the chicken shawerma platter was too heavily spiced I couldn't even taste the chicken, and the rice was heavily spiced and flavored as well and it just did not go well together at all. I think maybe a white rice with such a flavorful chicken would be better, or maybe mellowing them both out might be a better solution. Either way, it didn't make me feel like I was enjoying the meal and I didn't exactly feel like I hated it. It was meh. When I tried the beef shawerma sandwich first thing I did after the first bite was take out the beef from the sandwich because that tasted SO GOOD, and the cucumbers just did not go well at all in the wrap. At all. The second time I ordered, I decided to get the beef shawerma plate because I figured the meat would be as good as it was the time before. Wrong. It was OK, and still heavily spiced. Meat arent supposed to be SOOO heavy on the flavor, I'm supposed to be able to enjoy the actual meat and this just did not perform. the french fries were beast though. I'm literally going to go back for french fries because omg so delicious. I feel bad giving a bad review like this, but I just paid $30 for a meal that I left on my table and cant bother finishing because it wasn't good, and I had expected good food given all the positive reviews on this page. I didn't think I should give anything over two stars for being so disappointed for the second time in a row. I don't think I'm going to rule out going here in the future and they're definitely still an option for me, but minor changes like this need to be made. This did not taste like shawerma. Not the first time. Not the second time. And i've had a wide range of shawerma experiences and this just did not come close to being the actual thing.

Luckily there is nearby street parking, but I wanted super close parking because of the rain.My kimchi jigae was fantastic, with more pork than the usual places. The broth was also excellent.

The chicken lacked the inasal flavor. Size was smaller than what I expected. . Price point: we paid 40 dollars without the tip. A bit steep for the type of restaurant and food quality. Feel bad to write my first review especially for a filipino restaurant. The bright side is customer service was good. They should heed this review for what its worth. Suggestion: change the decor.

After that, I asked to speak to a manager and when he came out and I started explaining the goings on of not only that day, but how it's been the norm for quite some time now, rather then own the problem he said he was sorry and that he had only been with the location for a very short time as if to use that as an excuse for all the issues I had seen today!I worked in hospitality and if the front of the house looks this bad and the management is ok with it, I can only guess how bad the back of the house, where they prepare all the food, is!

You were waiting for an update, right? :)They still are not doing a great job. Either management doesn't see it as important or staff is just careless about it or both.I came in for dinner at 4:30 or so and I'd say 80% of the entrees or side dishes seemed to be wrongly labeled. It was almost comedic how thoroughly incorrect so many things were labeled. Imagine chicken with the sign above it saying spare ribs, or rice saying corn, or carrots saying potatoes. You get the idea.Now, I understand that lunch becomes dinner at some point at all buffet places, and the menu changes somewhat and new dishes are brought out. So signs have to change. \u00a0Dinner is supposed to begin at 3:30 at this chain, so I presume the dinner dishes come out at that point. But it was already 4:30 and everything was mislabeled as far as the eye could see.I pointed this out to an employee, who laughed and said I shouldn't read the signs by the food because \"it'll drive you crazy.\" To his credit, he did \u00a0go around changing some of the signs at that point along with another worker to try to sort things out a little better.I got especially irked because I went over to the salad bar and the seafood salad was labeled potato salad and vice versa. The labels were swapped. Not a huge deal to most people, probably, but as I've pointed out in previous reviews, I have extremely bad allergies to fish and seafood. If I start chowing down on seafood salad for whatever reason, I'll be off in an ambulance to Swedish Covenant to breathe steroids through a tube for a few hours (if I am lucky). I mentioned the error to the hospitality manager but he was not so hospitable. He changed the signs around but seemed annoyed and unhappy that I was bringing it up. Instead of thanking me for giving a damn, he said, \"Are you OK?\" Like I was a freak for mentioning it.I like this restaurant. The food is good enough, in general. The price is affordable for the value you get. The bus staff is attentive and I'm sure overworked for what they get paid. So why can't the managers get this one thing right? Patrons deserve to know what each and every dish is, every time they come here. Not just because it's professional, and because it is what restaurants are expected to do, but because it's the safe thing to do; customers have all sorts of allergies and special diets to contend with.I know management does care about this because they actually reached out to me in the past to discuss it and apologize when I complained online...but problems persist. All restaurants need improvement, so I hope this one realizes that consistent and attentive food signage would be an easy but significant improvement they can make. We shall see.

Standouts are their truffles of all varieties. I particularly love the cappuccino and brigadeiros, their specialty. The latter are dense, creamy morsels of chocolate covered in silky milk and dark chocolate shells. Their peppermint bark, too, was delicious with chunks of peppermint stick throughout dark and creamy white chocolate. As far as the baked goods? From my experience-- pass. The chocolate cake tasted dry and stale.Service was enthusiastic and friendly. The man on working the register was very knowledgeable about available products and eager to tell us about the history of the shop.

Me too!Apparently, my beagle does as well. I was walking my beagle and realized this charming store was open, went inside to see doughnuts, chocolates, caramel, candy, chocolate bars galore!

I bought another doughnut, cinnamon-sugar crusted, to be nice to Boyfriend, sleeping in after a very long week at work.

That's no favor. \u00a0 We had my mother-in-law with us who is an avid chocolate eater, so we cashed in my already paid $15 and it turns out the chocolate was not as smooth and creamy as my mother-in-law craves. \u00a0Local businesses are wonderful when they treat you well and serve excellent products. \u00a0This is one local business we will never return to.", "rating": "1", "date": [2012, 2, 11]}, "54": {"description": "[edited @ bottom.] \u00a0Okay, so I'm trying with all of my might to love this place. \u00a0I mean, it's right down the road, totally cutesy, and locally owned. \u00a0Buuut, it's not quite happening.I've been in there a few times now, and don't get me wrong, the owners are so sweet and welcoming! \u00a0This place has a great atmosphere, so if you're trying to escape the bustle of Starbucks or the like, Beijo could be for you.I will also note that on weekdays you get a free donuts with the purchase of a regular coffee before 11am. \u00a0Mind you, you should bring cash if you want to take advantage of this deal because there is a $5 minimum for credit, or they add $.50 to your purchase. On one occasion, I was in while one of the owners was making peanut butter cookies. \u00a0They were fresh out of the oven, and boy were they nummy! However, every time that I buy a typical baked good here, I am severely disappointed. One night, my very sweet husband brought me home both a heart-shaped cookie and a brownie from Beijo. \u00a0I was so delighted...until I realized they were both unbelievably stale. \u00a0I'm not talking just a little hard-to-chew stale, I'm talking crumbles-when-you-bite-it-and-my-dog-wouldn't-even-eat-this stale. \u00a0That was my first Beijo encounter, and let me just say...it left a bad taste in my mouth.Since then, I've been back a few times (seriously, I've tried so hard to love this place!) and every time it's the same. \u00a0I bought my husband a dozen cookies...stale again! (I know...maybe I should have learned my lesson, right?)I've also gotten the coffee/doughnut deal, and the coffee is just mediocre. \u00a0Also, the donuts are...well, just okay. \u00a0I love donuts (should I be admitting that?), but I didn't even finish my chocolate-sprinkle donut from here. \u00a0They weren't stale, but were just a little tough or something. \u00a0Not that squishy delicious taste you hope for when biting into a donut.On the upside, my husband did bring me some chocolates one day, and they were very good! I think, overall, they have potential, but they need to figure out a labeling/dating system...and when it's just time to throw it away!In the meantime, steer clear of the cookies!//edit:So, it's been a long time coming, but I'm finally taking a minute to update my review. I should note that I really should have made it a point to update sooner- I mean, if I can take time to tear someone down, shouldn't I go all the more out of my way to lift them up? Down to business: Laura & Krunch are just as sweet as ever, and are both genuine and generous. My North Park Spanish class meets there on Fridays, and almost without fail, Krunch will bring us over a treat, or something new to try. This was how I tried a donut again for the first time since my last experience. And I must say, it really was a perfect donut. I won't describe it in detail because unfortunately, I think many of us are well-acquainted with the implications of this. i also have taken a liking to the hot chocolate, especially because Krunch always offers little marshmallows AND whipped cream. Yup! Laura and Krunch have obviously made vast improvements in there labeling & dating system, because I haven't had a stale anything since before my previous review. I really enjoy their muffins- there is a wide selection, and they don't just have the run-of-the-mill options. At Beijo, I really enjoy the atmosphere, the people, and every treat/drink I have tried thus far. I also really like the supporting local part. As with almost any local spot, the prices tend to be a little bit higher, but they are consistent, and It's obvious that they try to keep them as low as possible and still keep their business profitable. So just expect it and you'll be fine. I consider Beijo to have joined the Albany Park family, and I'm so glad to have them in the neighborhood.

I only mention this because it's walking distance from Northeastern IL University, where I teach. But when I'm on the bus in the morning, I just want to get to class, and in the afternoon I just want to get home. But recently -- and when I sat \"recently,\" it could be any time during the Obama administration -- recently Beijo ran a Groupon, which was a perfect excuse to treat myself to some chocolatey goodness. Score.I'll start with service, since that was the first impression I came away with, and to save you any mystery, it was excellent. The male half of the team that runs the place was there, and though he was in a meeting and I was still browsing, he took time to walk me through their offerings and make suggestions. While I sometimes prefer to be left alone to explore, in a store like this everything needs an explanation, so I was happy for the assistance. He was not only knowledgeable and enthusiastic, but something you don't see often enough these days -- proud. He was proud of their wares, and excited to bring them to me. God bless the small businessman. And you know that Groupon. He knew exactly how I could manage my purchase so that after the discount, I would owe 37 cents. For those of you whose discounts have been met by a grumpy response or worse, you know how delighted I was.I spent much more than the 37 cents, though, because there were too many things I wanted to try. I bought a mixed dozen chocolates, and could easily have bought two. They tend toward dark chocolate, which is fine with me. Their house specialty is a Brazilian dark chocolate truffle, and was lovely. I forget what else I got, though I know that a couple of champagne truffle, orange creams, and peanut butter cups were in the mix. In addition to the chocolate, I bought some curried coconut brittle, and I've been jonsing for more ever since. They did not have the bacon cheddar muffin featured on their website -- I weep -- but the ham and cheese croissant was a nice substitute.With all the developments of the 21st century, the rise of the artisanal chocolatier may be my favorite.

The service counter was disorganized, and it was unclear who was taking orders and who you should pay. The \"everyone does everything\" approach works, when it works. But here it did not work. I paid for my food (a salad and slice of pizza) and was told it would take 7 minutes to cook, as there were no cheese slices ready at the moment. That's fine! I said. I am used to the strangely long waits for a slice of pizza at this point. I waited for the 7 minutes. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. Finally I went up to the counter and asked what was going on. I eyed the 5 delicious-looking slices of cheese that were ready in the display. The woman at the counter seemed confused and flustered, but also irritated with me. I went back to my table. It was another 5 minutes before ANYTHING came to the table. Why? I'll never know. For the record, the food was absolutely delicious. The salad was fresh and the garlic-buttery crutons are amazing.

I ordered the Galbi, which is served with rice, jhap chae and sliced radish. I enjoyed it with the knowledge that it is a fast food meal and not fine dining. I ordered the Bul-go-gi for Chris, because he has never had Korean food before. He said it was ok, but he doesn't know if Korean food is his speed. I tasted his Bul-go-gi, and I agree with him. It is ok. My Galbi was a lot more flavorful. We also tried their pot stickers (Man-Doo) and enjoyed them. You get like 8 or 10 of them in an order. It is not exactly cheap eats for being fast food, but for now anyhow, delivery is free.

My heart. My parent's like to say that in 1974 when the moved into their house a few blocks away from this family owned local gem, they ordered a pizza and ate it among the moving boxes in a then empty home, and they never looked back. Since then a lifetime has passed, children were had, and raised, and out the door, yet Martino's has been a staple throughout. And all these decades later we still dedicate at least a couple of our family Sunday dinners a month at Mom and Dad's to satisfying our collective need for a Martino's fix. Maybe it's because their pizza and pasta are what I grew up eating, but I have never found a pizza or order of baked mostacholi with marinera could ever love the same. Even eating their mozzarella stix, with hot delicious homemade marinera \u00a0turns a fried standard into a near delicacy. Over 28 years, I can count on one hand the number of times that I have eaten inside their comfortable and quite dinning room, so I might not be the best to speak to that, but I will say everyone of those few times was just swell. The waitresses most often handle the front of the house pick-ups along with the owner Rose, or her daughter Carmella, and the service has always been great. \u00a0They never mess up our orders, even when they are rather large and we almost always have it delivered. I strongly recommend Martino's. As a matter of fact, when my sisters and I show up with a new \"friend\" every once in a while for those Sunday dinners, we all secretly judge him based on his reaction to the thin crust pizza, pastas, salads, and whatever else we fill his plate with. If he shares our love for this quality restaurant, he's gained a number of points. Tje only negative thoughts I have about this place come when I think about all the thousands of bucks we have spent their over the years.

Pure Cafe is a hard place to find. My wife and I had to weed our way past the Mattress store, the Baby store and the closed Borders to find the place. The trek through strip mall hell was well worth it. Our experience at Pure Cafe was a lot of fun.  The decor is quite minimal. Other than a few flat screen TV's, there is nothing to speak of. No worries, I like a place that keeps it simple. Not only was our server stunningly beautiful, she did a wonderful job. Pure pours a generous drink. The splash of diet coke in my bourbon was just that, a splash. I was pretty woozy when I walked out the door.  The menu is quite odd. The bar is obviously aimed towards a Eastern European crowd, but there was an entire section of Mexican food on the menu. I opted for the safe route and ordered a burger and some wings. The wings were quite good. They didn't have as much heat as I normally like, but they were delicious. The Burger I ordered was fresh and tasty.  Here's the bottom line: Sometimes the good things in life are hard to find, but when you find them they're worth the wait. Pure Cafe is one of those things. We enjoyed great food, wonderful service and a fun atmosphere. If you are looking for a dining experience outside the norm, Pure cafe is worth a try.", "rating": "4", "date": [2011, 11, 18]}, "11": {"description": "My first experience here, I was there to just order food to go. There was no one there to greet me right away which was kind of awkward and I noticed other people waiting by the bar so I figured someone would. A few minutes later, a guy at the bar noticed I haven't been helped and took my order (although he didn't really seem like he was trained to take orders yet because he wasn't familiar with the men). \u00a0I probably waited 7 minutes for my order which was a little longer than I thought considering the fact that there was only 2-3 other customers. I ordered the Turkey Pesto and split it with a friend and it was really good. It wasn't \"AMAZING\"...but it was what I expected. Their fries though were AMAZING. I really enjoyed the seasoning on them and made me wish theaters served them in buckets. That's pretty hard core for french-fry-wishes.I gave this place another shot on a Sunday night. Again it wasn't very busy, my friend and I were the only ones dining give or take about 4-5 people at the bar. Sunday nights they have $5 burgers which were truly everything I wanted and more. Sunday night football on plasma TVs all around + $5 burger on cibatta-like bun + $3 drafts was exactly what I needed! The waitress was very friendly, a little bit too friendly for me personally, and at times, I had this feeling she forgot we were even there. NOT COOL. But it was hard to get mad at her because she really was very hospitable and warm.I've watched this place grow in the last few months and I have noticed them making a lot of progress. They have more and more people coming now for lunch and have bands come in on weekends which help fill up the place too. I'd keep a lookout on their specials...I've noticed they change them up daily.

We did the dinner for two, which was a little over $20. You get crab rangoon, eggrolls and pork pieces to start. It also comes with wonton soup. The wontons tasted homemade and the broth was tasty without being too salty. We opted for Mongolian Beef & Pork Egg Foo Young. The Mongolian Beef was easily the best version of this dish I've had. The meat was charred nicely and not mushy and tasteless like most places. It had a good level of kick and there was no MSG-filled sauce. The pork egg foo young was good, but this type of dish is very old fashioned. The real winner was the beef for sure! The meal was followed up almond cookies and forture cookies.

And to help those, who like me, were a bit confused on how to be initiated into the world of table-top Korean grilling I have written:Koren BBQ for White Girls 101Boo-il Galbi is a great place to have your first experience. The waitress who greeted us (as opposed to when we went to Chicago Kalbi and weren't even acknowledged, and had to stand awkwardly in the doorway behind a crowd until we gave up and left) was friendly and helpful. There was no language barrier, and she informed us how to pick, cook, and enjoy our food. So...TIP #1 - Ask your server for help, or see if you can bring an experienced friend along. Remember this is your meal, don't be afraid to ask for help to fully enjoy the experience!It appears that most places want you to purchase two orders of one dish to get a cooker at your table. The reason you can't order individual items is because each item may be cooked in a different way, and you have to order enough meat to make it worth it to make the fire. Plus, some items may not go along with others - ie: some may be cooked over flame, others in a small hot skillet. Thus,TIP #2 - Pick which meat your group likes best and order 2. Base your other choices on meats cooked in the same fashion. Refer to Tip 1 if you don't know which these are.As you wait for your little fire to arrive, you are provided with some sort of hot tea. While this was great because it was FREEZING in the restaurant (I believe due to the grill vents in the ceiling) the tea wasn't exactly.....everyone's cup of tea. It had a very...acquired taste. Thankfully once the fire arrived, we all warmed up even without the beverage.TIP #3 - You don't have to drink the tea, you can ask for water. And you can take your coat off when the grill arrives as you will defrost then.If you wonder why you are waiting it is because it takes them time to ready up your table top camp fire. Not too long though, about 10-15 minutes. When it comes out it IS rather exciting. With it you are provided an array of side dishes while you wait for your meat. Tip #4 = Try all the side dishes, even if you have no idea what they are.Then finally the meat arrives. We had the marinated short rib first, which was thin cuts of beautifully marbled steak. It also game with four large rib bone chunks (more on that later). Now it was time to cook!Tip #5 - Take the meat in the tongs and place several slices of meat on the grill, making sure they are flat. Let them cook for a minute or two (you will see the edges start to get a nice brown) and then flip them. You can also grill the garlic cloves, but be careful not to burn them.Tip #6 - Don't burn the meat! Once the meat has been cooked on both sides, snag it off with your chopsticks. DO NOT USE THE TONGS. They were just getting cuddly with some raw meat juices...not tasty.Tip #7 - Put your meat, a little rice, some sauce, a little garlic, and a little of the seaweed shreds in a leaf of lettuce. Roll and eat and talk about how good it is with your mouth full. It is also acceptable to shove the meat directly into your mouth, granted it isn't still burningly hot from the fire it just sat on.Tip #8 - The bone hunks sit on the grill at the edges, NOT in the middle. Let them cook, turning them occasionally, while you cook all your other meat. It takes them awhile and you can't always tell by sight. Once cooked, pull it off, let it cool, and eat the bits of meat attached to the bone. You may be provided scissors to cut the meat off (and any char from the long grill time) and for the true meat-lover, it is so, so worth it. This chewy, juicy meat has some of the best flavor and nutrition, thanks to the bone that gave it tasty awesomeness.In addition to the beef we had pork belly...which is not intestines (as the nonfoodie may initially think) but a type of BACON. Yum.Tip #9 - When cooking fattier meats (like bacon) on the charcoal grill, keep them on the edges. The melting fat makes the flame flare, and will potentially burn your bacon. Tragic.Tip #10 - The pork belly is served with a sesame seed oil with salt and pepper. A little touch of this to the pork belly is excellent, but don't go overboard.and finally...Tip #11 - Don't plan on going to a friend's house or anywhere fancy after this, unless they don't mind you smelling like fire and grilled meat. But really, why should you hang out with anyone who doesn't like the smell of grilled delicious meat?Overall the experience was a blast. Yes we were freezing until the fire was brought out, and the place could use some redecorating. But the service was awesome, the food was fantastic, and it was a FUN interactive dining experience.

They actually use wood charcoal, which cooks the saeng(unmarinated) beef quickly and with a lovely sear. The few times I have been here, I have always ordered the saeng galbi. The quality of the meat is heads and shoulders above most other Korean restaurants. The meat comes pre cut in bite size rectangular cubes and has great marbling, probably from a prime or choice cut. Sear each side of meat for perhaps a minute and you are ready to go with either a traditional lettuce wrap, or with a sesame oil/salt/pepper dip and other traditional sides.

Those are resolutions I actually look forward to keeping! So this year, I challenged myself to learn to make a new cocktail every week, and with that, I'm also trying to use the proper glassware. I've been searching around for a classic coupe glass ( which also doubles as an old-school champagne glass) that wasn't inappropriately large, but the only ones I found were either way too big or were over $10 apiece. I didn't need anything fancy, just one to serve its purpose. Apparently this is a difficult thing to find. Why does anyone need a cocktail glass that holds 7 oz. of liquor? Three sips in and your drink is too warm. Ah, yes, it's the old \"bigger is better\" mentality.My hunt led me to Krasny. I'd always been curious about this place but due to its prohibitively inconvenient hours (M-F, 9-5), I could never make it in. I was taking the day off yesterday anyway, so I was finally able to put my curiosity to rest and check it out.Victory was mine! They carried three different sizes of coupe glasses (not to mention any other type of glass you could ever want) as well as other cooking tools, gadgets and assorted restaurant wares. As I feared, I could only purchase the glasses in multiples of a dozen. But at less than $40, I went for it. They're nothing fancy (just regular old Libbey brand), but they're exactly what I needed to start making all those fancy drinks. \u00a0And naturally while I was there, I stocked up on other kitchen tools and doodads. This stuff is utilitarian. They're not carrying plates that Alinea serves food on; \u00a0It's restaurant- grade, and meant for heavy use. The place itself is bare bones, wonderfully dingy, and retro in that old mom-and-pop-store kind of way. The owner is super helpful and knows everything about what he sells.What a great source.

I've never even heard of this place, and the word \"club\" had me thinking there was actually some kind of membership required. Well, luckily there is no membership. The place is not that big, but it's apparently pretty popular, because there was a 30 minute wait when we got there on Saturday morning at 10. By the time we left, the line was just as long. I checked up Yelp to give me some guidance, and even though there weren't that many reviews, most were pretty positive. Problem is, I didn't really know what to get, since, like most breakfast places, their menu is pretty big and everyone has their own favorite.CHORIZO SKILLETThe item with the just slightly more mention than most on Yelp was the Chorizo Skillet, and on top of that, the ingredients were really close to the Mexicana Skillet at Wildberry in Schaumburg, which is one of my 10/10 dishes. Obviously, since I love that dish, every bite of this was going to be in comparison to that.Let's start with what's in it: chorizo, onion, tomatoes, black beans, avocado, sour cream, \u00a0chipotle sauce, roasted potato hash, 2 eggs, and cheddar cheese. I replaced cheddar with Chihuahua cheese in mine, which is what I do at Wildberry too. Now, a few of the differences here were the addition of black beans, diced potatoes instead of hash browns, and chipotle sauce. It also was missing the jalape\u00f1os. They did give a few leaves of cilantro, but it was more like garnish than it was for actual flavoring, which was a problem. Cilantro really helps flavor the dish with a flavor of freshness that only it can provide.Now a thing about chorizo...it's salty. It's delicious, but too much uninhibited chorizo and it just because a salt mine. It's the job of everything around it to balance it, but not to snuff it out (like omelettes usually do). The loss of cilantro hurt it a bit, but the black beans, while I think of as sort of a neutral addition to the dish, cut it a bit too. The potatoes I think were seasoned great to eat by themselves, but if the goal was to cut the saltiness of the chorizo, it actually made it worse. The avocados and sour cream helped quite a bit too, but there was just a little too much chorizo at the end of the day, and it ended up being a bit too salty for my taste.Now the biggest thing is this chipotle sauce. Wildberry gives you the spice in the form of jalape\u00f1os and salsa. That gives you a nice clean spicy kick. The salsa and cilantro in Wildberry's skillet give you the air of freshness and the salsa and jalape\u00f1os add a little bit of sour instead of salt. The chipotle sauce here gives it a little too much bold and salty flavors and just sort of ends up dulling the peaks of the chorizo, but again, adding salt. I can probably explain it like this. If you like the taste of Tabasco (clean, spicy, pointed, sour, sweet), you'll like Wildberry's better. If you like Cholula (bold, salty, smoky, steady) then you'll probably like Bryn Mawr's. I for one am definitely still Wildberry!BISCUITS & GRAVYI only had a taste of this, but while I can't say a whole lot for the gravy, I can say that the biscuit tasted too doughy for me. Not really a fan of that flavor. I want more buttery and creamy flavors. McDonald's biscuits I think are pretty top notch.BEING BAD FEELS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?I dunno...not so creative right now. That's a line from the Breakfast Club. Anyway, the place has a lot going for it. The menu is pretty decent, so I'm sure you can find something to eat here.

I've never even heard of this place, and the word \"club\" had me thinking there was actually some kind of membership required. Well, luckily there is no membership. The place is not that big, but it's apparently pretty popular, because there was a 30 minute wait when we got there on Saturday morning at 10. By the time we left, the line was just as long. I checked up Yelp to give me some guidance, and even though there weren't that many reviews, most were pretty positive. Problem is, I didn't really know what to get, since, like most breakfast places, their menu is pretty big and everyone has their own favorite.CHORIZO SKILLETThe item with the just slightly more mention than most on Yelp was the Chorizo Skillet, and on top of that, the ingredients were really close to the Mexicana Skillet at Wildberry in Schaumburg, which is one of my 10/10 dishes. Obviously, since I love that dish, every bite of this was going to be in comparison to that.Let's start with what's in it: chorizo, onion, tomatoes, black beans, avocado, sour cream, \u00a0chipotle sauce, roasted potato hash, 2 eggs, and cheddar cheese. I replaced cheddar with Chihuahua cheese in mine, which is what I do at Wildberry too. Now, a few of the differences here were the addition of black beans, diced potatoes instead of hash browns, and chipotle sauce. It also was missing the jalape\u00f1os. They did give a few leaves of cilantro, but it was more like garnish than it was for actual flavoring, which was a problem. Cilantro really helps flavor the dish with a flavor of freshness that only it can provide.Now a thing about chorizo...it's salty. It's delicious, but too much uninhibited chorizo and it just because a salt mine. It's the job of everything around it to balance it, but not to snuff it out (like omelettes usually do). The loss of cilantro hurt it a bit, but the black beans, while I think of as sort of a neutral addition to the dish, cut it a bit too. The potatoes I think were seasoned great to eat by themselves, but if the goal was to cut the saltiness of the chorizo, it actually made it worse. The avocados and sour cream helped quite a bit too, but there was just a little too much chorizo at the end of the day, and it ended up being a bit too salty for my taste.Now the biggest thing is this chipotle sauce. Wildberry gives you the spice in the form of jalape\u00f1os and salsa. That gives you a nice clean spicy kick. The salsa and cilantro in Wildberry's skillet give you the air of freshness and the salsa and jalape\u00f1os add a little bit of sour instead of salt. The chipotle sauce here gives it a little too much bold and salty flavors and just sort of ends up dulling the peaks of the chorizo, but again, adding salt. I can probably explain it like this. If you like the taste of Tabasco (clean, spicy, pointed, sour, sweet), you'll like Wildberry's better. If you like Cholula (bold, salty, smoky, steady) then you'll probably like Bryn Mawr's. I for one am definitely still Wildberry!BISCUITS & GRAVYI only had a taste of this, but while I can't say a whole lot for the gravy, I can say that the biscuit tasted too doughy for me. Not really a fan of that flavor. I want more buttery and creamy flavors. McDonald's biscuits I think are pretty top notch.BEING BAD FEELS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?I dunno...not so creative right now. That's a line from the Breakfast Club. Anyway, the place has a lot going for it. The menu is pretty decent, so I'm sure you can find something to eat here.

I am NOT a Taco Bell fan, BUT ... there are times when it is extremely convenient. For example, today, Christopher knocked a cap on one of his teeth loose. I did have plans to make steaks today because of the Memorial Day Holiday. Needless to say he wants to avoid anything that needs extreme chewing. It suddenly hit me to get some Taco Bell soft tacos. I went through the drive through and got the 12 for 10 bucks. (With tax it came to exactly 11 smackeroos.) I brought them home and offered one to Mom, who of course hates Mexican food. Well now I have proof that Taco Bell is not Mexican food because Mom really liked the tacos. She said she could understand why young people like Taco Bell and because of the shredded lettuce on top proclaimed her tacos as \"nutritious\". She actually ate 2 of them. Saints be praised!! I did have 2 myself, doused in hot sauce, and Christopher is working his way through the rest of them this afternoon. So, I have to pronounce this Taco Bell as OK, because it bailed me out of a lot of cooking and Mom liked it. I will put my personal taste on the back burner for now.

When I called Minari, the owner lady said that she could make seaweed soup (she didn't even ask why I was looking for it), even though it wasn't on the menu and I had called the day of--turns out, there's a Korean market across the street, so she went to get the ingredients just for me. I Uber-ed from Hyde Park with a Chinese friend, but when I got there, the owner lady had packaged our meal to go because she thought we were taking it home. When I explained that we were going to eat there, she nicely and quickly unpackaged the food and served it to us in bowls--the food was still hot (or maybe she reheated it?). Also ordered bulgogi for my friend, who liked it a lot. Best service I've ever encountered at a Korean place. The owner couple were so friendly and attentive to our needs.

Thank God I saw the photo before I went there. Otherwise, I would be lost. The reason I wanted to try this place is because I had really good Gam Ja Tahng in Vancouver and I found that Minari serves seafood spicy soup. So, I kinda wanted to relive the whole experience.I ordered pan broiled squid, grilled white fish, and a deluxe seafood pot. The squid was excellent -- sweet and spicy but the whitefish was just okay. It did not seem very fresh to me. There were a variety of stuffs in the seafood pot: crab, prawns, fish, radish, and even brains or brain look-alikes etc. However, the soup seemed like it was made 10 minutes ago. A good soup base is boiled for hours and it's hearty and flavorful. Clearly, this is not. The side dishes are great and my favorite is the anchovies. The server kept giving me more side dishes when he saw that the dishes were empty. And there's no charge for extra rice! I was kinda disappointed though that kim chee weren't part of the sides.The service was not bad but the server was not very good at speaking English. There were only two people working in the restaurant: the cook and the server. It makes sense because there are only 9 tables. So, do not expect fast service. I think I was the only non Korean in the restaurant. The signs inside were mostly Korean except the menu.
