This one has seriously raised the bar and my esteem of Chicago's stores. I love the layout - it actually reminds me of the store in downtown Minneapolis, except better. There is free covered parking under the building, and when you go inside, you can take the stairs, an elevator, or an escalator upstairs to the shopping floor. At the top of your ascent is Starbucks and their little fast food joint (pretty smart on their part; who wouldn't want to grab a drink while they shop?) and a plethora of carts and baskets.

I've been in Chicago a little over a year and was very excited to learn a Target was being built near me.

I moved here from Georgia, which is Wal-Mart land. Upon moving to this city, I realized I would have to quickly become a Target shopper, or drive to another city.I am hooked. In my opinion, this location has THE BEST clothing clearance of all in the city. Easy to find( back, right corner, by dressing rooms). Dresses for $7.56, coats for sale..just lovely! The Glade candle selection is awesome, and a $1.30 cheaper than if purchased at CVS. I've read many reviews about not selling booze...well they do now! I recently purchased a bottle of Grey Goose in preparation for Memorial Weekends festivities. I would recommend this location to anyone living in the Near North Side area.

Never mind it's been a year since I've stepped foot in the gym, or that my gravelly cough sounded like I should have been in the TB ward. There I sat, grandly checking NO to the various death sentences. Heart disease? NO Cancer? NO Lyme Disease? NO Insanity? NO....Now it was time for the exam. Melissa did the usual \"listen to my lungs, chest, blah, blah\" but then actually ASKED QUESTIONS and really drilled down on what was making me so miserable. She actually spent TIME with me, and correctly diagnosed my cough cough cough as an allergy. I know, not so dramatic, but given my daughter had recently dropped off her cat, announcing Chaz would be taking up residency with me, I just had not put the two together. Melissa told me what to take to relieve the symptoms and (reluctantly) even wrote me a prescription for an antibiotic that she said I didn't need but would anyway. She was even kind enough to give me physician referrals. Now this is where the unbelievable part comes in: Melissa even went out of the clinic to personally choose the OTC meds I needed.

I generally hate the one floor layout Targets in the city because they're so overwhelming. I'm looking at you Target on Elston. Instead, this Target felt easy to navigate and shop, not overwhelming at all.I like this Target for its easy to shop layout and great parking underneath the store. The straightforward design of the store and close proximity to our peds makes doing return trips to the area desirable after checkups.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 8, 4]}, "45": {"description": "Dr Paik and her team, Katrena, have been so helpful in assisting me with my glasses purchase this evening.

I was suprised given the other Chicago locations. There is a large parking lot but be careful of crazy drivers. The store is well stock and clean. I was surprised that the easter candy hit 70% off and 90% off with other easter items. There was also winter salt for 70% off. There was significant amount of everything left over which is unheard of at a city target. Pros- great selection, large storeCons- Crazy drivers in the parking lotHidden deals- Discount items abound. Target mobile coupon and cartwheel for additional savings. Target credit card for 5% back.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 5, 2]}, "41": {"description": "Missed the Target. Bah dum dum. Reviewing a Target store location kind of goes against my grain. It's the type of place that EVERYONE is already familiar with. If you've ever been to a Target, they're all pretty much the same, right? Right. I mean, come on, do you ever Yelp the corner Walgreen's before you head on over to make sure it's a \"good Walgreen's\" or do you just go because it's the one in your neighborhood? Exactly. However, in this case I have some interesting information that you might find useful if you've been at all curious about this new, monstrous Target that has sprung up on what used to be Cabrini Green land.From gangbanger territory to sanctified shopping ground, this Target shines like a gentrification beacon on the not-too-distant skyline horizon. There isn't much else around save for the Dominick's shopping center at Division and Clybourn, so I'll be keeping my eyes peeled to see if this helps to further enterprise this area of the city.However, I likely won't be back. Remember those interesting facts I mentioned about this locale? Well, here they are... 1. This Target does not sell alcohol. At least not yet. Supposedly it's coming soon, but for now, no beer no booze no wine. That does not a fun supermarket section make! 2. It is not nearly as big as they want you to think it is. From the outside, it looks TREMENDOUS. But it's so very false. The parking lot is a multi-level, enclosed structure that is designed to look seamless from the outside. They did a good job of that, but half of what you think is the store is just where you put your car. This store is actually much smaller than the Elston location I like to frequent. 3. Escalators. In addition to the misleading size, the actual \"store\" part of the store is all located on a second level. You must go up the escalator to enter or exit. And, if you happen to visit on a day when one is shut down, as I did, you'll be pretty disappointed at the Plan B. 4. Plan B is everyone smushes into an elevator with their carts and bags and kids and smells. No, thanks.

I'm surpnised that they're even friendlier than the LA employees I've encountered. I don't understand the rantings of a few reviewers. If you're looking for an obscure food item- go to Jewel Osco or Mariano's. Target is a place to get higher-end stuff for a low price. It is not Wal-Mart.
