However, instead of him giving me what I had before, he tried to convince me that 1 small order of rib tips would be sufficient enough to make up for the 2 large tip orders I had the night of the worst and last case (there have been others). It's one thing to have good food and another to have integrity and good service. The service at Ben's is horrible.

BBQ smoke. so like a bloodhound I engage and follow it to it's source, a little cue house on the corner, son.I'm talking bout first of all, I ordered an extra large tip cause I'm thinking. They probably on some Honey 1 BBQ sh*t \u00a0where they be steady ripping off hipsters and yuppies who don't know no better \u00a0and me too who do know better but didn't \u00a0have no choice because Honey 1 BBQ is the only real BBQ joint in Logan Square. But I don't F*ck with them no more, son. Yea, I can understand Honey 1 BBQ \u00a0\"coming-up on a come-up\", by getting some clandestine \u00a0\"reparations\" for 400 years of slavery by \u00a0over charging white folks for miserly proportions. But I'm a Brotha! \u00a0So how you gonna juke me? \u00a0But then I remember that this is da hood, son. \u00a0And in da hood you can't get away with steady ripping folks off unless you're a JP Morgan Chase, CitiBank or Bank of America investment banker or an elected official. \u00a0But any way, \u00a0the price was only 13: 89 son instead of the 20 dollars they charge at Honey's! \u00a0And my man behind the triple reinforced bullet proof( for all you predatory jackers out there, go else ware!) counter top window, comes back with a Leaning Tower of Pisa made of firm yet tender rip tips dripping with hot and mild sauce, and, not just one, not just two, but THREE slices of Wonder Bread perched atop of it like a White LL Cool J Kangol Cap, you-know-what-I'm-saying? I'm saying though! \u00a0So I get it home right, cause it can barely fit in the boot of my scooter and I got a huge cactus also for the ride home, but that's another story. So any way, I get home and unveil this rip tip tower. I'm talking taller than the steeple of the Mormon Temple that's about five miles north of Washington D.C,son! \u00a0D.C. ain't go no BBQ, but that's another story. \u00a0Any way, so I sample on of these savories. \u00a0First I get a powerful burst of hickory infused with cherry wood with a deep hint of allspice. I thought it was cinnamon at first. Then I tasted the spicy zest and saw saw an allspice pepper in the sauce, boyyyyy! I ain't lying. How clever is that?I ate four of them mutha F*ckers cooked to perfection. I'm talking moist grayish pink on the inside and gently charred on the outside holding it together like a sandwich. And after the third, my belly was swelling, so I put the rest away for tomorrow's dinner, keyed. \u00a0I'm saying. Now lets add up the stars. The taste and quality of the tips, get the highest rating, three stars, son. On value, especially during what is the second American Depression, three stars. Sauce,three stars, and during these pandemic violent times in Chicago, what has become a very important rating, Thug Love, zero stars! Seriously, I saw the white socks and white T-shirt man and the Boot leg C.D man, and the scrape metal man, but no thugs hanging and or slinging, and this is a corner spot, yo.

Experienced locals order spiced ground beef or steak on small corn tortillas folded in aluminum foil with shredded lettuce. Mind you, neither the cooks nor the proprietors are Mexican but at just or $1.60 a taco, this lapse in authenticity doesn't seem to bother the munchie crowd who orders them by the dozen.Problem is, the grossly over-weight old folks who operate Peeples Taco behind the plugger and hand-drafted note infested bullet-proof glass are glacially slow, forgetful, hard-of-hearing and with an unabashed snear could utterly care less about your time or patronage. Yes, be prepared to wait... and wait... and wait still some more.Nobody knows why it takes so damn long, but during your crucible of tolerance you're forced to eavesdrop in on the colorfully profane conversations of blue-jean clad local drug dealers and dirty gym-shoe wearing wanna-be gangbangers as they holla obscenities at their various baby-mommas on uniquely decorated cellphones while standing or pacing as they count a knot of small bills. It's not actually unsafe (statistically I don't know for sure which murders sustained a conviction), but it's as close as you will get to feeling imminently in danger without actually needing a tourniquet soon. Nothing revs the appetite more than the fear of getting accosted.

Generous and cheap. Try not to stare at the preparation or it may be hard to keep down as an afterthought.Somehow Peeples is a sick twist on Chicago comfort food. Familiarity can be reassuring, even if it's bad. Lots of folks have grown-up on this crap. Is it any wonder why obesity, heart disease, and diabetes kill more residents than anything else.

Since I moved to this area, I have searched high and low for some decent chicken and all the places out here in the suburbs, to put it mildly, have been a major disappointment. Finally I found a place that knows how to do it right! I am originally from Kansas City, and we have some pretty fantastic chicken places like Go Chicken Go, Stroud's, RC's and several others. I also have family down South in Georgia and Florida where places like KFC, Church's, Popeye's etc. can hardly operate a restaurant in many towns because all the independents with their great great grandfather's recipe beat the shit out of them and the locals know their chicken (try Po' Folks if you are in the St Petersburg/Tampa area). A coworker of mine that stays in the city recommended Uncle Remus and I am glad I took him up on his advice as the grub was spectacular.Don't be in a hurry if you are coming here as the line does not move along at a rapid pace. \"Fast Food\" this place is not. They make your meal to order, and I wish I would of read the reviews here at Yelp more closely and called in ahead of time so it would of been waiting for me when I got there. The girl at the counter was very sweet and hospitable and gave me a short rendition since me staring up at the menu probably gave away that I had never been there before. I went with the three piece with fries and a roll and made my way to my table. I also picked up a side order of fried okra, as it is a personal fav of mine. There are very few tables here if you want to dine in. The vast majority of folks took their food carry out. Even before I sat down the smell on the walk over was heavenly. Even now I am licking my chops thinking about it. They douse the top liberally with hot sauce to let it seep in unless you request it on the side (saves me a step). This is a tactic that is very common in Georgia and the Carolinas as well, though not to be confused with \"Hot Chicken\" which is a product that is almost exclusive to Nashville (or people from Nashville). The sauce is a delicious and tangy addition, but not much in the way of heat so that it jives with most people's taste buds. I would be curious to know what is in it, as I have never had anything quite like it before so I am guessing it is something they concocted in house. I went up and got an extra side after tasting though. Delish. I am also not sure what these guys use in their batter, as it is probably one of those \"I could tell you but I would have to kill you\" situations. It is both flavorful and spicy. The skin has a lovely peppery flavor and is nice and crispy without being over breaded. This contrasts with the succulent meat of the chicken itself and the tangy flavor from the sauce to create pure chicken nirvana. SO FRIGGIN GOOD! \u00a0Also, a word to the wise, let it sit for a bit before diving in. They literally take it from the fryer to your basket and put it in your hand, so it is scalding hot. It probably looks like I have a cold sore on my lip right now from taking a huge bite initially. Rookie mistake on my part. The roll I had was quickly turned into a makeshift \"sandwich\" by me ripping some chicken off and cutting the roll in two. My Mother used to always consider this bad manners ranking right up there with drinking milk straight from the carton. I say screw all that noise. When I saw other people doing the same thing I felt an immediate sense of affirmation. I have actually seen a few people at a chicken place in the burbs trying to eat fried chicken with a knife and fork. Seriously? These freaks need to stick with their hummus dips and certified organic {insert food here} and leave the real food to the professionals. \u00a0 The fired Okra was also on point. As a person who has bought fresh Okra and tried to pull this off myself at home, trust me when I tell you it is very easy to screw up. The UR Okra was nice and golden brown, but not overcooked, which is the most difficult challenge in getting it right. Prices here are quite reasonable. You can get a feast for under 10 bucks. Overall, this place ranks among some of the very best fried chicken I have ever had, which speaks volumes coming from me. After having a couple of month drought when first moving here, I am glad I discovered this place when I did as it is a important staple food (at least for me) to have in the arsenal. I sort of wish they had waffles too, as I have a thing for the savory and sweet combo from chicken and waffle joints, but no need to stray from the path when they already do chicken so well. If you are in need of some good Southern cooking, this is your spot.

I have only tried the green tea snow since I got it the first time we went earlier this year at their other location and loved it so much I have not been able to stray. They do have lots of flavors though like taro, pumpkin spice, coffee, strawberry, and many many others. They also have a variety of toppings. You can take a look at my pictures to see the two topping bars. I personally prefer adding fresh fruit to my snow. You can pick two or add more for an additional charge. Finally, you pick a drizzle to go on top. I highly suggest the condensed milk. Other than snow, they have different dessert options like frozen yogurt, macarons, bubble tea, and cake pops.

Even New York doesn't have a shaved ice place like this.If you've been to Hawaii and tried their shave ice, this is slightly different. Instead of plain ice that gets shaved as it rotates in the machine and has flavored syrup poured onto it (almost like a light, fluffy, snow one), Snow Dragon instead flavors the ice first before freezing them into big blocks to be shaved down. Then you just choose what toppings you would like to add on, and what flavor drizzle to put on.I tried the green tea flavor, which is very popular, and the new chickoo flavor (a tropical Asian fruit that I've had before in the Philippines. I would describe the taste as something close to a pear in both flavor and texture), which turns out to be pretty mild in flavor.According to my cousin, this location in Evanston is a little smaller than the one in Lincoln Park, but they give you larger portions and the really friendly guy working here is more knowledgable about the food.

We got the green tea and black sesame shaved snow with condensed milk drizzle and three toppings ($8.99). There's many toppings to choose from, and most of them are sweets and not fresh fruit - I wish there were more healthy options! There were only a few fruits, which did not look very fresh. Also, the price seems a bit high to me - the serving size is quite large, but it's just ice and flavoring, so it'd be nice if the shaved snow came with more toppings. The green tea had a strong tea taste, which I really like, and the black sesame was also good, though not as flavorful. I've tried the red bean and watermelon flavors before and found they are also not as flavorful and tasty as the green tea. If you want to try something else, Snow Dragon also has macarons, macaron ice cream sandwiches, drinks, and organic frozen yogurt.I'll definitely be back but only because the green tea shaved snow is phenomenal, and will probably pass on other flavors, which really don't compare to the green tea for me.

After reading all the reviews and doing some researching online for female-friendly sex shops I was really excited to go check out Early to Bed. There's street parking out in front, so I easily found a spot and walked in. I was immediately greeted by a friendly woman in her 20's, despite there being other customers at the counter. As soon as she finished helping them she turned her attention back to me (I was the only other one in the store) and asked if I needed anything. Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I told her \"not yet\" and continued looking around. I circled the store once before she asked me again if there was anything I had questions about. We had some playful banter about it being my first time and she told me if there was anything I needed just to ask. After circling the store one more time I finally picked out a silk mask and tie set, a sexy board game, a bottle of flavored lube, and (the most exciting) vibrating cock ring. When I went up to the counter the associate asked if I wanted her to open the ring just to make sure it worked because of their strict return policy (which I appreciated and did), and afterwards she sealed it back up, rung me up (without making comments on what I had purchased, which being a little awkward already, I really appreciated), and we chatted a bit before I left.All in all, it was a great experience and definitely a store I will be going back to when I make the foray in to more varsity-level sex. The ONLY negative experience was that the store was pretty small, so initially I felt awkward about being so close to the cashier while looking around. I credit that to my (unneededly) nervousness about the whole shopping experience and doubt that I'll even register it the next time I go into the store.

The salesperson approached me when I was looking at their toy section and began a thorough demonstration of a $100 product. I indicated I wasn't interested and she left, only to return every few minutes to give me a hard sell on their $70 products. After indicating to her my price range ($20-$40), she showed me only one product that fit the bill then returned to her reasoning about how a $100 is an \"investment.\" Her aggressive upselling kept me in the store for an extra 45 minutes.The aggressive upselling continued at the counter, whether I was prompted to buy toy cleaner, batteries, lube, and a catalog. Thinking the catalog was free, I tacked an extra $2 on to my bill. The clerk neglected to give me my entertainer discount and, when confronted after the transaction, indicated that their computer was incapable of providing refunds and I was free to select an extra $6 worth of product if I liked. Upon asking to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing until I pressed for them to cancel the transaction.Sex shops are already creepy enough to begin with.

Cashier Tammy was very nice too and even alerted the Supervisor when I asked if there was a damaged merchandise discount (there is-10%) since the shoes in my size were a little beat up but I still liked them! Total damage? $38.93 for two pairs of shoes and a funky belt. So glad I checked it out!

But, as I reached back and looked on the other side of the wall, feces was spreaded everywhere! i do mean everywhere! It was sooooooo disgusting..and it really ticked me off. I understand the prices are cheap, but if you are going to lock up the bathroom as if you had it built in gold, please make sure its sanitary first. The worst bathroom experience in a public place in my life!!!! I will never ever use a bathroom in this place again! I told the woman after I came out that feces was all over the walls in there.

I have to say I kind of looked askance at the the area when parking but decided to just park on the side street (by the way they have a parking lot behind the place right off of Cicero so park there if they have space) and there was no problem whatsoever.We came during rush hour on a Friday night so traffic on the street was super busy but inside we saw only a couple of people waiting for their food and otherwise dead which I was surprised at and hoping was not a bad sign...It wasn't, I ordered the gyro burger and she the regular burger with fries. Counter service was by the wife/co-owner and husband was one of the cooks/assistant/waiter. Ordering was quick, kind, and painless.While we were sitting and waiting maybe 5 or 10 minutes (we weren't paying attention) the husband/owner/etc. (Jay) came running out to drop off a bottle of ketchup which was nice. Food came shortly after...The food...My [insert spiritual figure here]...The gyro burger was really popping out all over and I could not love it more...Gyro meat was flavorful and super delicious without being overpowering or over salty, etc. Mixed with cabbage, tomatoes, mayonnaise, onions, etc. was a very euphoric experience. And the fries, just like everyone else says awesome and addictive. My wife said her burger was delicious as well and I definitely believe it though I had my hands super full with the gyro.Talked to Jay and super nice guy who asked how our food was and genuinely cared. Seems like a great mom-and-pop community guy as was the restaurant.I really liked the quotes/precepts from Ghandi framed on the wall and another Random Acts of Kindness sign as well...Really go's to show again all of the above...The only problems, it is too far from home for daily or weekly convenient visits (it would be awesome if we could walk here), but on the way from work it will definitely be our go to place, if you eat in you will be comfortable (nice seats and people watching) though bring some wet wipes because you will definitely need them (maybe a bib too ;-), careful getting in if driving but once there have it and enjoy no worries, otherwise the menu is really comprehensive and easy to read, and most importantly if you eat in (or even if not) enjoy, thank the wondrous owners, and share widely and patronize again.Go here!P.S.

Judging from the way he brought it there (He's never been a server), it was tedious with those tiny, shallow, flimsy paper plates. I was already expecting a disaster...and disaster it was. It made it to the table, tipped over and a chunk tumbled off onto the table. He attempted to scoop it back onto the plate and threw away a big chunk we paid for. Ok...that was SUPER unhygenic!

Buy some furniture touch up markers (at various hardware stores) and some Old English Furniture oil and go to town. But not all pieces are damaged; inspect your purchase carefully.
