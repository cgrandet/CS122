It's a 30 years old and older bar (or maybe 25, I can't remember) so that cuts down on a lot of knuckleheads and riff raff. Whatever bartender I get, they're always knowledgeable about a wide variety of cocktails and I've never accidentally threw them a curveball with my drink order and then had to walk them through how to make the drink. I appreciate that. And when you order something with a generic recipe (example: a Manhattan or a old fashioned) they always ask which brand and spirit I prefer (example: bourbon or Canadian whisky, and then which brand). I appreciate that also. It shows they respect the customers' taste and preferences. I hate going to bars where they take your drink order, then proceed to give you whatever bottom shelf swill they want (usually to save money) because they figure your taste buds won't know the difference.

I was completely natural with self-dyed hair. Nikki was extremely friendly and easy to talk with. It's been almost 5 years since I have been in a professional shop to get hair care. I had been natural for almost 4 1/2 years. It was explained to me that Nikki does not do natural hair (but there is a woman in the shop that does style natural hair, but I do not remember her name). Before setting an appointment for Nikki I had already made the decision for myself that I wanted to get a perm, so Nikki not working on natural hair was not an issue for me. I wanted a perm because my hair is so short I wanted a softer look. My first visit with Nikki started very well (even though she was a little late to the appointment and I was her first client for the day) and I thought it was well understood how I wanted my hair styled. I was not 100% satisfied with my final style; however, I received a grand scale of compliments. I believe I just had a few personal reservations because like I said this was the first time in 5 years that I was letting a professional tend to my hair. I assume there was a misunderstanding to how I wanted my hair curled. The perm itself was AMAZING! My hair has not laid down like that since I don't l know when. And even days later when I washed my hair at home, it \u00a0was still very soft and straight. The texture of my hair after Nikki styled it was great. My hair was not crunchy but instead the curls were on point and soft to the touch. I have been to Nikki again since my first visit. Her and I a chance to discuss the last visit and I expressed my desire for fine tune adjustments to the styling. Nikki hit it on the head for the style I wanted for my hair this time. I will definitely go back to her again and I look for to playing around with colors and weave styles with her.

Superdawg. \u00a0Fluky's. \u00a0Jesus Horatio Christ, PORTILLO'S gets it right every time with their flawless Chicago dog. \u00a0Personally, I'd avoid these hooligans.Should you decide to give them your patronage (cash only), be warned that if you so much as think about ketchup while in here, the workers will call you out and/or ridicule you mercilessly, along with the koolaid-chugging fanboys in line. \u00a0If you want ketchup for your fries like 99.4% of human beings do, you'll have to stealthily smuggle in packets like some crack fiend anxiously waiting for the next bump.To recap: the Chicago style hot dog is a sham, Rachel Ray can blow me, and the management will likely take exception to any and all negative feedback, despite their sky-high approval rating on Yelp.Nevertheless, I stand by my rating. \u00a0Suck it.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 12, 1]}, "11": {"description": "The great Chicago Hotdog at it's best.

True story: one time I was out to go get some milk, fruit, and bread - nothing special. Went to Jewel nearby and walked around to get what I was looking for but I was absolutely disgusted! Ugly produce, weak variety, and worst of all - absurd pricing! Sorry Jewel, it's not your fault - I've just been corrupted by Pete's into thinking that all grocery stores should function as they do: clean, well managed, amazing variety, and off-the-truck prices will do that to anyone. The one on Cermak is my usual but I think the new Pete's on 95th is my #1. Nonetheless, for pretty much everything except some really more european and gourmet prepared foods you really can't beat Pete's Fresh Market. On top of that the service at this place has consistently been great and I'm constantly amazed at how good of a job they do with both food presentation and store cleanliness. Finally, some of their prepared foods are really amazing - you need to get the mango salsa and the guacamole is a must with grilling season just beginning. Deli is pretty solid and I think they just started getting Boar's head meats/cheese. Some unexpected findings include good gruyere prices and emmanthal. Butcher shop is pretty latin-centric but you can get most any cut of meat imaginable - the chorizo is cheap and good. Usually have some great prices on skirt steak and chicken. Bakery has a few things worth trying. I have found the kolachki decent and the turnovers are good. People always say the tres leches is awesome but I have not tried yet. Also, they carry this line of 'park avenue' bagels that I really like and are usually really cheap. Bottom Line: don't waste your time elsewhere, there are only a few wothwhile grocery stores in this city: stanley's, H mart, Trader Joe's, Aldi (at times), Fox and Obel, and Pete's.
