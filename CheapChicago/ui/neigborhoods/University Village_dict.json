I did not know this would be as difficult as it was to located and my deadline was Monday. I went to the local resource suggested through my hospital of employment, only to find a severe let down in terms of availability and overall customer service. The gentleman from that location, I believe to have been the owner, stated that he would call me back by 10:00 am with some answers pertaining to their other locations availability for the items I was seeking information on but he never did. Thankfully he never did because I am glad to have given my business to Chicago Scrubs. (He did eventually contact me about 5 hours later stating that they could not locate the items I needed, I told them thank you and that I already purchased the items through another resource.)After contacting several other locations, without having any success I eventually reached out to Chicago Scrubs seeing if they had what I needed, Will was the individual helping me and he was able to confirm that they actually did have 3 sets available in the size/color I needed. He was very helpful and assisting me with placing these items on hold so that I could drive downtown tomorrow and pick these up since I was coming from the western suburbs. He relayed to me all of the necessary information in which I needed for tomorrows pick up so that everything would flow smoothly as expected. In my eye's, he went above and beyond the normal call for customer service and for that he should be recognized in appreciation for his excellent skill set. I ended up having some afternoon flexibility between work so I contacted Will to let him know I would be by his location within the hour. When I arrive, he greeted me with the same professionalism I received from him over the phone. He had everything prepared and ready for me once I arrived. Bottom line, Will is an outstanding professional at what he does and Chicago Scrubs is lucky to have him as an employee. Due to the absolute amazing experience I was presented with today from Chicago Scrubs, on Will's behalf, Chicago Scrubs has just earned themselves a customer for life. I will happily spread the word about my experience to everyone I come in contact with that is looking for the same results I received today.

Everything tasted great and came at a reasonable price.What I was most impressed with was the speed and efficiency with which the staff took care of their customers, all while remaining warm and friendly.

That being said I think Guy Fieri is full of shit when he came and ranked this place so highly.The burger I ordered was mediocre at best and a bit on the over done side; the veggies that came with were what you may have had in grammar school as a kid and obviously straight out of a can; they were soupy, tough and sad looking. The soup options were clam chowder and chicken noodle; I opted for the former and learned that there are tomato based clam chowders; the soup was average.The second dish I ordered was the Grecian Tilapia, and from the menu description lead me to believe it was expertly prepared and high on taste; I don't know what the hell I was thinking as it was anything but. The saving grace to this entree was the greek rice that made it passable. The fish was over cooked, burnt on one end and looked like the cap came undone on the seasoning bottle; something akin to a young girl discovering makeup for the first time, too much.The nail in the coffin was when I asked the manager if I could charge my phone as it was on 16% and I figured I would be here for at least an hour; he asked if I was a customer and I motioned to the table directly in front of him with my winter attire and open menu. He said no. I just stared at him and took my seat. This review was written on my dying phone after the meal had been finished. I could forgive shit service or bad food, but not both; the twenty minute wait time to be served would have been dissmissable had other things been different.I opt you check out laurence fishery for some decent seafood on canal and cermak as that was where I intended to go originally, but hunger won out for me.Stay curiously hungry and adventurously hungrier on the quest for good eats.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 12, 4]}, "59": {"description": "Classic diner feel. 24/7 and HUGE menu.

Our waiter said that the manager had removed one of our orders, but we would have to talk to him about removing the rest of the orders. Okay, sure. All four of us go over to the manager and complain about how terrible our experience has been. He has the nerve to ask if we purposely put our hair on the plates, and says that it's impossible for hairs to have gotten on the food plates because all of the cooks wear hairnets.

We were made to walk around the restaurant to find a manager to ask for something to be done about all this.

(You can hear someone else's mom read it here: youtu.be/YqlOJKt4-RA.)This is my impression of White Palace. It's been there forever, and whoever owns it gets a big tip of my sombrero for not selling out. Moxie is worth an extra star. It's one of the few independent businesses in the area, after being surrounded by every chain store that you ever find in the suburbs (can you say Marshall's, DSW, Michael's, Best Buy, Home Depot, Bed Bath Beyond, Staples, Nordstrom Rack, whew, I've gotta stop... Though I'm giving you a pass, you over-priced gem of a goody-two-shoes health nerd, Whole Foods!).

Hell yeah!On a Saturday afternoon at around 2 or 3, I sat at the counter and the waitress offered me the Sun Times, the perfect read for the occasion. I had the skillet with corned beef--long, sandwich-style strips of corned beef, rather than the little cubes of beef and potatoes, which I also appreciate, but this had those crispy hash browns that I can't get enough of. Yum. A good afternoon was had by all.I only hope that this place doesn't end up like The Little House in the picture book, whose owner's granddaughter finds it in disrepair in the middle of the city and moves it out to the country.

The wifi is also rather slow (as most Starbucks in the city are). For drivers staying around the area, there is metered parking on Taylor, free parking on Loomis St towards Roosevelt, and on Roosevelt (watch the signs).For the morning rush, it takes me about 5-10 minutes to get through the line for coffee. There are areas around the street where I've seen people often put on their blinkers to grab and go (on both sides of the street).Overall, a great place to drop by to fulfill your coffee needs. For those not studying, the outside fountain makes a great place to sit down, chat with friends, and enjoy on a sunny day.

You don't always think great BBQ when you think of Taylor St, but you can thank the DMK people for that! I've ordered take out and dined in here multiple times and the service and food are consistently great. The selection of beer and daily whiskey specials are also good if you're in the mood for some adult beverages with your food too.This was 1/2 of my usual spots to bring visitors while I was living by UIC (the other being Three Aces) and all of my friends have loved it. The staff here are very helpful and attentive - you can tell they love the food there too and want you to try everything if you can! Some of the nicest wait staff I've experienced in the city.My go-to is the pulled pork or the chopped brisket sandwiches - yum! Really, you can't go wrong with anything* \u00a0(*see my note below). For sides, I suggest the mac and cheese (loaded or not, either way creamy and delish), corn pudding, and the hush puppies. The three bbq sauces on the table are good to mix Be aware - their sandwiches don't come with sides but their platters do.Reason for 1 star docked: I've had the blackened cauliflower and collard greens but it's a 50/50 shot on the potential of them being soggy, so I just go with the other options.

My favorite thing on the menu though, has to be their pork puppies, which are absolutely bursting with flavor and absolute perfection. Perfectly shredded and seasoned pork is balled together, and fried into this crispy, crunchy little bit of heaven- and the aioli that is paired with it makes for a heavenly combination. The food has always been amazing every time I have gone, and their staff is consistently friendly, helpful, and very sweet.The atmosphere of County is very homey and comfortable, and the outdoor seating is perfect for nicer weather.

For our sides we chose the Mac n cheese, collard greens, and garlic fries. First off, they got our order wrong and we were missing two of our three sides (got garlic fries and cheesy grits instead of Mac n cheese and no third side). Secondly, the rib tips were so incredibly salty after just one bite nobody else touched them. It was as if they were literally dunked in salt! I had about 5 full glasses of water that night. We also ordered the taco trio and it was just okay. Nothing special even though it was recommended by the waitress. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars was for their customer service.

It was a good 5 mins while standing there before they came along when my friend appeared through the door. That was a shame.We were seated outback of the restaurant (spacious) given the fact, its behind the restaurant. How to imagine the place: a cute cloth resting on the table with a candle. Depending on where you're seated, you may be next to another customer. Food wise, I ordered the St. Louis Spare Ribs (Full). It's a big order, I thought I could share but even then there was lots of food leftover. Garlic Fries on point but wished there was more.

From the exterior of the building appear to be a large building but once inside, the exterior is much different then the interior. There is a large long bar that takes up most of the room and the rest of the floor are different size tables for dine-in. \u00a0I had to admit that I had a hard time ordering due to too many items I want to try now, glad to see that there are combo's listed for people like me who can't decide on just a specific item. I choose the best two items for beginners to County BBQ.1. \"Meat and Three\" : Protein of your choice and three sides - I've picked the St. Louis Ribs (Dry)2. Texas Two-Steps\" : Brisket, Grits and Greens.After a few hours eating all my goodies from Country BBQ, I have to say that the brisket is my favorite. The brisket was well-made, the traditional smoke ring was apparent but what made the brisket so good was the \"fat cap\" (intramuscular fat: fat that is between fibers within the muscle, in other words \"marbling\" which gives the meat rich texture and flavor) in the brisket.From my experience from eating brisket in other places other than Country BBQ, the brisket is more on the leaner side which sometimes leaves the brisket itself on the dry side. The second protein I've ordered was the ribs which I choose \"dry\" on purpose to taste the smoke and all the spices rather than have the sauce mask all the nuances of flavor. From the sides that came with my meal basically was an OK and the only thing that I like was the sweet potato fries that was decent. I enjoyed the smoke salt that was sprinkled on the fries.

However they do have an outdoor eating area, also typical. First off, I always \u00a0appreciate when my server can tell me the menu front and back. John did just that. He knew the food, how it was prepared and what side items complemented them. I didn't order any alcohol, but I watched him Bartend a couple seated at the bar and he was equally knowledgable.

Just came back from my favorite BBQ place in San Diego, Phil's, so this place had a lot to live up to. I ordered the spare ribs with garlic fries. I wasn't too sure about the ribs since I'm used to getting baby back, but these were really tender, fall off the bone ribs. I also liked that they serve them dry so you can add the sauce yourself. They have a house BBQ, spicy, and mustard sauces. I tried all of them and they are all pretty good. My one complaint is the \u00a0sides. The garlic fries tasted ok, but I'm pretty sure they just made some fries and added some garlic powder. I was expecting the kind with chunks of garlic and parsley, but oh well. And the cole slaw was not your typical cole slaw. It was really dry and kinda reminded me more of sauerkraut or kimchi. I guess I'm used to cole slaw with a little more mositure. My friends got the fried chicken sandwich and the brisket which they said were good too. I tried the corn pudding my friend got, and it was delicious! I would have a side order of that next time I go. It is a little pricey ($14 for ribs, fries, and cole slaw), while at Phils I can get more food for half the price.

My group of friends and I arrived with minimal expectation and left not only full, happy, but also impressed. We picked the restaurant randomly while strolling on Taylor St, looking for a new place to try out. The entrance is actually quite small, so if you're with a big group, there's a great chance that you'll have to graciously bob and weave the pedestrians before getting inside. You'll walk in a standard set up of any restaurant, with a bar on one side and dining tables right across. The atmosphere is casual, typical for a BBQ place, but let me tell you the smell was everything! You'll know right away you're in the right situation for some pull pork sandwiches, maybe baby back ribs, and fried pickles? yes please! It was a nice, breezy Sunday evening, so we decided to sit outside (they had a little patio in the back)! Our waiter was super nice, informative, funny, and on point with getting our drinks and food. I ordered grilled pork in chimmichurri sauce tacos, which was their special tacos for that night. It was definitely filling, an order comes with 3 tacos for $8, and I was full after finishing my 2nd one, yay for leftover! My friends ordered some chicken sandwiches, ribs, and sides of fries (sweet potatoes or garlic! and both were really tasty). My bf got an order of pull pork burger, but they accidentally forgot to put in the order, so his food ended up coming out...5 minutes after our food! You know what they did to make up for this mistake? They started bringing out a side of \"complimentary\" corn pudding, grits, garlic fries, basically every side we could have ordered for an extra $2 each, but instead..they were all FREE! The amount of side dishes my bf got was insane, no exaggeration, to a point that he was quite full by the time his sandwich arrived lol it didn't stop there! When we were about to pay and leave, our amazing waitor came back and gave each of us a card with his name on it, to any DMK restaurants/bars, and if we present it, our next draft beer is on the house! I mean..we will have to come back now!! I absolutely, 100% recommend County BBQ! If you live in the UIC/Medical District area, it's a must try.

John our waiter was great he welcomed us and sadly informed us right away what we came for the spare ribs they ran completely out of but would be will to substitute any meat on menu. We had the hush puppies and two specialty house cocktails that we watched on check please and other yelp reviews. The hush puppies were great starter a must try. We then order as our main meal the meat and sides platter due to the ribs being unavailable we decided pulled pork and BBQ chicken the sides we choose we Mac n cheese, the corn pudding and the sweet potato fries w dipping sauce. The pulled pork was good nothing special to write home about but the smoky crispy skin on the chicken was amazing this chicken didn't need any sauce it was that great. Every side recommended by yelp reviews and check please are a must try. The corn pudding was so yummy good we actually argued over last bite but our server resolved it and sent us home w a extra cup of corn pudding. The sweet potato fries were crispy and not greasy very addicting especially the nice sauce on side for dipping. The mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy and not to heavy or eggy tasting and very nice job. The restaurant is a little dark hard to see the menu had to use phone to read menu as others did comment on previous reviews I do have to agree. We thought it was a cozy dining experience staff was very attentive and nice throughout our whole visit.

Luckily County BBQ was a great suggestion to help catch me up a little!Marissa was our server and she was super welcoming and gave us the run-down of the drinks not posted on the menu. (Not updated since apparently they have a healthy rotation.) Beverages:I could have sworn the Mosaic on tap was advertised as a $5 special, but looking at the bill later, they were itemized at $7. Hmph. I would have just gone with a Revolution since I've grown to love heartier brews and my guess is they'd be at a similar price point. The flavor of the Mosaic was still fine. Oh well. I had a sip of the Milk Stout, and it was nice and full with chocolatey notes.Pork Sandwich ($10):My +1 had the Pulled Pork sandwich and declined a side add-on. The sammy was HUGE - stacked high (primarily) with pork and a bit of coleslaw. He enjoyed it but said it was a bit too saucy for his particular tastes. He ended up going the fork + knife route at the end due to the wet, slidy sloppiness. That's how BBQ is supposed to be though, right? Not exactly sexy date food. 1/2# Brisket ($14):Speaking of sauce: the Mustard sauce was pretty darn good. My brisket didn't need much flavor help, though, since the rub + natural juices all but covered that base. My +1 boasted it was fall-apart tender... not quite, but not too far off! \u00a0A half pound equates to 4 slices, btw, which doesn't seem like much. If you're ravenous, you might want something with a larger portion size. \u00a0The Garlic Fries were plentiful (enough to share!), well-seasoned, and piping hot. Total win there.Food runners were friendly and relayed a request for water (which the bartender brought over).

Grubhub it is. Our order came really fast, that is about the only good thing about this place. We got a half slab of ribs, mac n cheese, pork hush puppies and a pulled pork sandwich. The ribs were delivered dry with 3 different bar b q sauces to choose from and they all sucked! That's pretty sad when your a bar b q place and you don't even have 1 good sauce out of three! One was some sort of pineapple fruit or something, why would you want that on ribs? I used my own Sweet baby rays sauce out of my fridge, always a good choice. My husbands pulled pork sandwich was a wet mess! They put the cole slaw on the sandwich, as do most places, but should not do so when it is delivery. His bottom bun was like a sponge! Speaking of the cole slaw, it is disgusting, I spit it out! Even if it was good the portion was embarrassing, it was literally 2 bites, that's it. The mac n cheese was so salty and the portion was also tiny and they charge $7.00 for it. Are they insane? I didn't even try the hush puppies, my husband said they were super salty as well. Everything was so salty, everything! The only thing decent was the fries, how sad is that?

If you have read any of my other reviews, I have spent a LOT of time in Kansas City, and have pretty high standards for BBQ. This place first of all is much smaller than the storefront would make you believe. As the bar takes up a good amount of the available space, I will first say that the beer selection is limited to about 8 taps. Not bad historically, but not exactly what I would call diverse in this age of ever expanding beer selections. I went with the chopped brisket, which is a personal favorite of mine. I much prefer the texture of chopped brisket to that of sliced. The reason it isn't offered chopped as often as it is sliced is moisture, and I have to admit that in the case of County BBQ, that was its failing here. There was a good amount of smoke and bark, and the sauce is more than adequate to the job, but the sandwich I had was just too dry. I probably needed to be there on a busier day, or go against my preference and try the sliced brisket instead of the chopped.Service was pleasant and always there when I needed it, no complaints. The Taylor Street corridor has many more offerings than I had previously realized, and I will probably add the area to the places I come and look for unique offerings in the future.

An American-style strong Barleywine brewed in Scandinavia, using sake yeast from Masumi Sake? \u00a0How could I go wrong? \u00a0Two ways, actually - with pricing and taste. \u00a0Overall: 4 out of 5Love this place. \u00a0I'm sure I'll try out their \"tasting room\", (16 beers on tap, fine spirits, and some cocktails) at some point. \u00a0I'm sure at some point I'll also want some artisan cheese and meat products. \u00a0Highly recommended.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 4, 22]}, "44": {"description": "Everyone knows this chain has a very good selection of wine and all other liquor.

Not only do they have aisles upon aisles of all types of booze and brewers you never even knew existed, they also have a \"clearance rack\" of end-of-bin stuff priced to move, and a bar inside! I found exactly the vodka I needed on the clearance rack for $7, winning! I also immediately signed up for a rewards membership, which can get you sale prices and cash back on wine purchases and so forth.

Union Ave. (I shall not mention its name here - it is already confusing enough.)The snag is because; depending on when you were here, you might not especially remember all the details of what you had, much less which stand you visited. But the fog of your memory would express [oops] that this was the northernmost stand. Then, in a lucid state, you logged on to Yelp and looked the venue up. You saw an address of *1236* S. Union. You posted your review of that venue as being \"Express Grill\".And you were erroneous.There is no stand at 1236 S. Union Ave. That is a non-existant address. (It would be in the middle of the street just south of Roosevelt Rd.) The northernmost stand is *NOT* Express Grill. You reviewed *the opposition*. Please cut out your review of the opposition and paste it into that restaurant's reviews.After we finished videotaping 'Chic-A-Go-Go!' one Saturday evening, I had extra time before I needed to get to the Twisted Spoke. I was on another CTA 1-day pass. I walked over to Halsted St. and caught a #8 Halsted bus south to Roosevelt and walked the two blocks over to Union St. I deliberately chose Express Grill.I opted for the beef Polish ($3.35) and a 20-ounce bottle of black cherry soda ($1.25). My money was collected in a small tip tray. (I haven't seen any business using that since I visited Tokyo.)I had mustard and grilled onions on my polish. It was a good all-beef polish slightly pink on the inside, but with enough roasted meat flavor to be succulent. The french fries at Express Grill are institutional. They're not great. Interestingly, you will get generic ketchup packets for your fries at Express Grill. [Oh geez. How did the \"never ketchup!\" hot dog purists miss that in their reviews?] In a sense, those who visit here are also doing so to absorb the atmosphere. But unlike Superdawg [c.v.], at Express Grill, it concentrates on its food. The prices are low. It is a solid value for the money. This is the cheapest restaurant in the Roosevelt | Halsted area (to briefly mention the opposition - it charges the same prices - there is no 5\u00a2 or 10\u00a2 undercutting by one stand from the other). Which is likely why it is sequestered off on a freeway frontage road. Fancier, more expensive restaurants and lounges do not want you to know about venues like this, especially when it's walking [or staggering] distance from them.Transit options: Express Grill is open 24 hours a day, and buses which serve it run for all of that time. The #8 Halsted bus runs northbound from here until 1:00 am; southbound until 2:45 am. The #12 Roosevelt bus runs east from here until 12:45 am; west until 1:11 am. After that, catch the #N62 Archer bus [30 minute intervals] on the corner of Halsted & Rochford St. [1230 S.] to downtown.

Nobody knows you by your real name, \"Express Grill!\" Back in my UIC days, the debate was always \"Maxwells or Jim's?\" That's why Express Grill only has 19 reviews, and Jim's has 129, which, ironically, also shows the sudden shift in clients!Express Grill or \"Maxwells\" and Jim's were always next to each other (why? I dunno). Jim's was always the desperate ones. No line and no customers. Their cooks were always leaning out the window calling out to you as you walked by to go to Maxwells. Us frequenters went to Maxwells because we believed the Polish tasted better here. Newbies went to Maxwells for fear that Jim's was unsanitary or something because their lines were empty. Lol @ Newbs! Each item comes with some thick, flimsy, tasteless fries (add salt and it's pretty good) and last I remember a Polish was just over $3 and the rest was under $3. Been a while though.POLISHYou have not tasted a Maxwells Polish until you've tried it here. Do NOT even think about saying that you had a \"The Original Maxwell St Polish\" at [Insert Venue Here]. I don't care if it was Wrigley Field, Portillos, or some random hot dog stand. You have not experienced the real thing. It's funny too, back in the day, you had to literally risk your life to get Maxwells, now it's in such a nice area! It's a polish cooked on a greasy grill with greasy grilled onions on a bun slathered with mustard only, and really hot peppers (sometimes). The peppers aren't jalapenos, they're something else. My mouth is watering now just thinking about this! The polish is just perfect! It's smoky, salt, flavorful, but not overpowering! The bun is sitting in a steamy container, so it's thin, so you don't just taste bread. The mustard with the polish is just heaven! And finally, the onions. Oh yes the onions...I don't know how they make these, but I've been trying to recreate it myself and have failed on all accounts. Their onions are so perfect! They're \"sauteed\" so to speak, but are grilled on the same greasy grill with the same grease rained down upon them. They caramelize to just the absolute PERFECT point where they don't have the crunch and sharpness of raw onions (I hate raw onions) but they're not so mushy either. They have a softened texture of their own and they are OMG so freaking good and sweet! The entire collection just melts in your mouth as your eyes roll in the back of your head. Yeah it's that good!You want to know about Chicago? Have a Polish, it tastes like Chicago. Figuratively, literally, whatever, you cannot die before having one of these! ThePORK CHOP SANDWICHIt's a bone in pork chop, just so you know before you go breaking your teeth! It's got the same mustard, onions, and peppers as the polish. TIP: For a pork chop, you can't go when it's too busy - you have to wait a long time, and you run the danger of getting a not-so-cooked one. You can't go when there's nobody there, those pork chops have been sitting on the grill for a while, so they're dry. You have to go either at the tail end of a rush or after the rush. You'll get the perfect pork chop then. Trust me, I lived about 50 paces from Maxwells and skipped class to test this out (I did just about anything to skip class)! TIP 2: BITE CAREFULLY!When you get it right, this is pretty darn good! Pork chop doesn't have too much of a pork flavor, but when you get a good bite (bun, condiments, and pork) it makes a great combination! The texture is what does it for me!CHEESEBURGERI have never in my life had a cheeseburger that melted! The beef and cheese on a flimsy bun with the mustard and onions are so incredibly good and buttery! I don't even know if they use butter, but it feels as good as butter! And you bite it, and it literally wants to melt in your mouth! OMG! Drool!THE RESTNot good. I'd rather have a Filet O Fish instead of their fish. Chicken sandwich is whatever. Don't waste your money. The hot dog is just a hot dog, bun, and the same mustard/onion condiments. Now, I hate hot dogs, but love a good Chicago Style Dog, and this is not a Chicago Style Dog, so no thanks! In fact, if you order a hot dog with the onions and mustard, you take a bite, and you think to yourself, \"Now why in the hell did I not just give a few more cents and get a Polish?\"The whole world tries to copy Maxwells...but nobody even comes close!

I went there with my wife and I was not happy with the experience. So much so, I will likely not be back. From the second we ordered, we knew things were not going to go well. My wife wanted an iced tea, they were out of all flavors. She asked for a lemonade, they were out of all flavors. I overheard at another table that their ice machine for frozen drinks was broken so none of those. My wife had the pizza Margherita and I had the lasagna. The lasagna was delicious as it has always been though the portion is shrinking. My meal came with a roll that was swimming already in the pool of tomato sauce around the lasagna. The side salad was bagged lettuce with 1 piece of celery and 1 piece of pepper. Now a pizza Margherita is simple, crust, fresh tomato, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Usually these 9\" pizzas are on the menu for $9-$12 at equivalent places. This one was $15 plus a two dollar up charge for gluten free which I have no issue with leading to a total price of $17. I am not Italian but I am taking offense on behalf of all Italians out there. There was nothing fresh about this pizza. It had some weird oily pesto on the crust with rubbery mozzarella covering the whole surface and a few slices of watery tomato on top as if it were pepperoni. The taste was ok but it was not what it purported to be and it is not worth 30% more than most other places.

I started going to Leona's in 1989 and had been amazed over the years in the consistency and quality of the food and the service at any location I had ever visited. Having moved back to the area after several years away, I could not wait to go back for some of my favorites like the lasagna, the cheeseburger pizza, the hamburger pizza, the psychedelic salad and even the occasional fruit cup. In October of 2013, Leona's did not disappoint. The psychedelic did not have all the specialty greens that it once had but is was still good. The other specialties were as amazing as I remembered. In January 2014 I read that Leona's had sold the business and had new management. Although I was a bit worried, I tried not to panic thinking that the new owners were at least smart enough to keep the current menu. Now it is March 2014 and I have had the misfortune of ordering from them three times in the last month. They do have a new menu, which is as basic as a mall food court pizza place. The food, delivery and the service are night and day different in a bad way. Gone are basically anything distinctive and unique. Gone are the cheeseburger pizza, the hamburger pizza, the psychedelic salad.Even basic stuff like the hickory burger that was on the previous menu, is now a build your own sandwich exercise, and even when you tell them the ingredients, it does not taste the same. I had a salad instead of fries and the salad came in the smallest little food container I had ever seen. \u00a0The items on the salad looked like something from a hospital dining tray. The dressing was terrible. My hubby had the fries and they were an embarrassment. He could not believe it came from Leona's. Instead of burger, I ordered fried catfish. You used to be able to order a small or large and you would have 2 very nice side items like pasta. That is gone too. I also used to have Leona's cater special events for me but no more. I am so very sad that the business and clients the Leona's family has built for 50 years is going down in flames in less than a few months of new ownership. I'm sure the new owners think they are saving money by cutting the quantity and quality of the food but if I am no longer a customer, how much money can you make from me?I woefully have to cut Leona's off of my go to list. Chicago doesn't need a run of the mill pizza joint. They need the family dining restaurant that has thrived of 50 years.

My mistake.Ichiban (\u4e00\u756a) in Japanese means \"Number one,\" and I honestly can't say that the restaurant keeps to the namesake. A large group of us came in for lunch one day and most of us decided on the AYCE option. This restaurant (and Volcano) allows each individual to order themselves, instead of doing one large order for the group. The good thing about this is that you can bring friends and NOT have them be forced to do AYCE if they don't want. On the other hand, it doesn't allow you the stomach room to try more rolls than you order.Each time an order is placed, you are \"restricted\" to 5 pieces of nigiri, 3 rolls, but as many appetizers as you like. Being a sushi fan, I usually just go for the nigiri, especially salmon. However, the overall preparation of the rolls was so slow that most of us got pretty full just on the first order.The rolls that I managed to try this one time were the Ichiban and Alaskan (which also contains samon). The Ichiban contains applies which is different from most rolls I've had, but the tempura in it was pretty bland. For $12 a la carte, I wish it had a little bit more POW in it.At a price of $19.50 lunch including tax and tip, I can't say that this is totally worth it, but I am giving it a few stars up for the fact that they let me take home my one order of food because I was experiencing a hiccuping episode that made me want to shoot myself.

I asked the bartender to please hold our drinks and seats while we checked on the car. Again, no credit card was asked of me. Upon our return to the bar (less than 10 min later), I found both our drinks gone and our seats taken. I asked the bartender what happened, to which the owner came up to me and asked me to pay my tab. I was confused. Not only did they clear our drinks, but then I was being asked (quite rudely) to pay my tab. I responded by saying that we weren't done drinking and fully intended on staying for more drinks and music. At that point the owner accused us of trying to skip on our bill. Never have I been so insulted in my life! As a musician, I may not be rich, but never in my life have i walked out on a tab. And if i had tried bailing, I sure wouldn't have come back in! Not wanting to cause a scene I paid my tab and tried to enjoy the rest of the set. Within moments the owner came to my table and told me that we weren't welcome in his bar and that we should leave. Unbelievable!! As a return patron, and paying customer I was being told to leave. The owner appeared to be visibly intoxicated and unimaginably rude. He practically escorted us to the door and disrespected both myself and my friend. Who gets in the face of a lady?? Is this guy serious? What type of business owner treats his customers like that? Honestly, I used to really enjoy this spot. Good drinks, great live music. It's very unfortunate that It's so poorly managed. As the manager of a Chicago business, where I deal with the public everyday, I could never imagine treating my customers this way. I am truly disgusted with this establishment. I will never, EVER, consider returning to beviamo. And as for my musician friends, they too will never play there again.

It's a super cute, low key wine bar with live music. The layout is long and narrow with eclectic, rich d\u00e9cor. There are small tables lining the wall window and a few love seats and with low tables to choose from. Find whichever spot works for you! We went with the love seat... I was on a date after all! For starters we sampled the wine flight, which comes with 4 varieties, 3 white, 1 red. I wish it was 2 and 2 but oh well. I had never heard of wine on tap so I wanted to try it out. Our server said they are just 1 of 3 or 4 other spots that have wine on tap so it's exclusive! The flight included healthy pours of a Zinfandel, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and some other white wine that I had never heard of (Gavi) and I would like to never remember because it tastes like bland, flat water. Have you ever heard anyone describe wine as tasting like bland, flat water? What is bland, flat water anyway? I don't know either, but that's the best description I have for it. No bueno. Anyway, they change the wines on tap periodically and the flight only costs $12 so going 3 for 4 was still decent odds. They featured a few specials as well for between $5 and $7 and on average, the wines were reasonably priced and they had a good selection. For you non-wine drinking wanting to frequent a wine bar LOL... they also have craft cocktails and beer.I was having such a good time that before I knew it 4.5 hours had gone by! Over time, people came and went and later in the night (starting around 11 or so) it started to get pretty thick. The crowd was diverse, which I enjoyed and appreciated, and everyone was having a good time.Music:You can check the venue website in advance to see who is performing on any given night. Chris Slone (chrisslone.com) was performing the night I went and he was AMAZING! He is a true musician. He can sing, play the guitar, play the piano, entertain the crowd, ad lib, rock out to any genre it seemed, take requests, etc. I must say that I appreciated all of the MJ tracks he performed too! I was already impressed but once he sang PYT (my fave MJ song of all time!) I about died! Check out his website and see where he's performing next. I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for Chris Slone. My date was a little jealous... rightfully so. LOL.Tip:They don't serve any food... no peanuts, pretzels, chips, piece of bread, nada.

I'm not sure if other servers feel the same as I do but after a long shift all I really want to do is have a drink or two and relax and forget the stress and anxiety from a late night rush so I stopped in for a drink.The bar was empty except for the bartender and two guys at the end of the bar who seemed like regulars.I sat down and the bartender checked my id. I was robbed a week ago so I've been using my passport and we chatted for a bit about where I've been and where he's been. He seemed a little drunk but that's typical given how late it was. I ordered a scotch neat and he went to make it. I saw him put ice in the glass so I said again, 'I'll just take it neat.' He poured out the ice, put my drink in front of me and walked over to talk to the two regulars who were TWO SEATS away. I opened a book and started reading and heard him say, \"What kind of fucking pussy orders a scotch neat?\"I looked up from my book, then went back to reading. One of the regulars said something and he responded, \"He just seems like an arrogant asshole.\"So I looked up and said, \"I'm sitting right here, I can hear you,\" and he turned to me and said, \"I know,\" then turned back to the regulars and said, \"Fucking asshole.\" I then asked him, \"Did I do something to offend you?\" and he said, \"Yes.\"I honestly had no idea what to do so I asked for my bill and he said, \"You're a \"server\" (and he used the rabbit ear quotation marks to say that), you should know how much you owe.\" I stood up, took out my wallet and put a five on the bar and he came over and started laughing and said he was 'fucking' with me and just giving me a hard time. I asked for the bill again and he put his hands on the bar and said, \"I will fucking destroy you. I will destroy you in life. I will destroy you in women. I will destroy you in money.\"So I left my five on the bar, put on my coat, and left.I really can not express how ridiculous the whole experience was. I have never been treated that way by anyone. There was absolutely no exaggeration in any of this. Everything quoted was as said. I'm still not sure what I did to offend him but I said less than five sentences to him and there was really nothing more than talking about the trip to Europe I took six years ago when I was in college. I'm not sure if he is the owner or not but that was the most incredible thing I have ever witnessed. I've been a server for eight years and never has a table, nor another worker ever acted the way he acted.So, yeah. I would give the place three stars because it's an interesting place and would have been a great place to grab a post-shift drink and relax for a little. But there is absolutely no way I will ever go back there and I recommend everyone else stays far away. We should not support an establishment that treats any person that way.

Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a third time and it would appear I'm a glutton for punishment. It got one star because I couldn't give it zero. I really, really wanted to like this place. The first time I went there the first 3 wines I ordered by the glass they were out of. I realize things happen and places run out of stuff. When I finally found a wine they had it came in this puny, spotty glass. I thought this was a wine bar? Not a great first impression. The second time it was a struggle for the 2 bartenders to serve us. We were met with annoyed scowls for disrupting there foul mouth chat session with their friends and a small group of Blackhawks fans. The only reason we stayed is because of the convenience of the location. The third, and absolutely my last time, it was a quiet night with not much going on in there. Upon facing the bartender to ask for a wine list it was evident that they were intoxicated. And when I say intoxicated, I mean slurred speech, lack of short term memory. Not only was I very unimpressed, it was sad. Their sub par service was ignored when their indifferent disposition changed to an aggressive and mean, scary behavior. It was unbelievable. That was my last straw with this place. Closed the tab and will never go back. To think that a business can be run like this is beyond me.

I will never use home depot for any big purchases in the future. I ordered a washer, dryer and dishwasher from the store. The store associate assured me installers will be able to do side venting on that dryer model due to space constraints. I was not a clueless customer, I measured my laundry room and knew what I was talking about. I paid everything and the delivery was scheduled a few weeks later. The delivery and installing company are most incompetent I have ever seen. When confirming delivery few days earlier, I again made sure they knew I wanted side venting, person on the phone said yes they will do it. On delivery day, the installer comes in and says it is their company policy not to do side venting. Couldn't they have mentioned this before when I repeatedly asked about it? I wasted over a month waiting for my washer dryer, wasted entire day waiting for the installer to find this out? Here I am still without a washer dryer and over a week after the failed dishonest installation attempt and still haven't got my refund back for almost 2000$ of returned w/d. I am on the phone every day with their customer service who still cannot figure out how to get my refund back, absolutely terrible. At this point I just want my money back and will never again buy anything from this store that costs more than $100, definitely nothing that involves any installation or delivery. I will buy those $5 flower pots, they can't screw that up hopefully.Update : The dishwasher install was also poorly done. 30 minutes into the wash cycle, it started making noises and then stopped working very first time I used it. Obviously the installer just made sure it works for first 5 minutes while he was there. Now I need to wait for manufacturer's repair man to come check it out next week and pay additional service charge for that too. I should have just refused delivery on the dishwasher as well.

Contractors for The Home Depot came on August 3 and installed the dishwasher; unfortunately, they left without testing to make sure it worked. Tenant called at 6:00 a.m. on August 4 to inform us that water was leaking, causing damage to the cabinets and to the light fixtures and ceiling in the unit below. The Home Depot guys had broken a pipe under the sink and that the water could not be shut off with shutting off water to all units. Tenant had been up all night emptying the water pan every two hours to prevent additional damage. FIRST ISSUE: The Home Depot contractors broke a pipe and left it leaking (and did not check to insure the dishwasher was running correctly)!I called The Home Depot on Monday. Customer Service gave me the name of the company that did the installation, Spirit Delivery. I called Spirit Delivery and they returned to the apartment to fix the pipe damage; unfortunately, they couldn't do the repair (something about copper pipes) and told me I had to hire a licensed plumber (they were not licensed plumbers???) and that I had to pay for the repairs and that their insurance company would reimburse me. Having dealt with insurance companies before, I knew there would be no guarantee of this promised reimbursement.I called The Home Depot, armed with claims from their website that stated \"We stand behind our contractors.\" They agreed to find a repair person and agreed to make sure I would have to pay no out-of-pocket costs.I again called Spirit Delivery. They admitted guilt. The owner was professional and said he would do everything in his power to make sure the leak was repaired properly, and the damage to the unit below was taken care of. The contact person for Spirit Delivery, Milva, was very nice and assured me that they would take care of the costs to repair the pipe and the water damage, and that they would find a plumber to do the pipe repair to stop the leak right away. She admitted fault and regret.It took The Home Depot/Spirit Delivery THREE DAYS to find a plumber. The tenant was up every two hours for three nights, emptying the water bucket. The leak was finally fixed, at no cost to us (we thought). The next day, however, when the tenant tried to use the dishwasher, it wouldn't turn on.SECOND ISSUE: The new dishwasher installed by The Home Depot contractors did not work!I called The Home Depot again. They gave me the phone number of the manufacturer. I called the manufacturer. Luckily, when the manufacturer's repair people arrived to fix the appliance, they were smart enough to realize that the dishwasher was under warranty and didn't charge us. They said The Home Depot installers had made a mistake.THIRD ISSUE: The Home Depot contractors failed to connect the wires inside the unit properly.Spirit Delivery had given us an insurance claim number and asked for an estimate for the water damage. Several days later, I was able to obtain a water damage estimate, and sent it to Milva, at her request. I received a call from a Farmers Insurance agent two weeks later. Stacy informed me that they insured the company who broke the pipe (not Spirit Delivery???!!!). She had a different claim number. I had not heard of the company who was apparently responsible. Stacy said the company did not admit fault, and that Farmers would be investigating the incident. I demanded to speak with her manager. He seemed unaware of the entire incident, and promised to get to the bottom of the two different claim numbers, the unknown \"other\" contractors who were in my building for The Home Depot, and their failure to timely address this issue.FOURTH ISSUE: It took five weeks to get a check from the insurance company for the damage to the unit caused by The Home Depot contractors.On September 1, the tenant gave us an invoice from Roto Rooter for the broken pipe repair that he received in the mail. It had not been paid by Spirit Delivery, as promised.FIFTH ISSUE: The Home Depot contractors not only broke our pipe, but they broke a promise to pay for repairing their mistake. We paid for the pipe repair out of the funds we received for the water damage. We were reimbursed for the damage, but NOT for the pipe repair, the frustration, and all the time we had to spend dealing with the tenant, general contractors for an estimate, The Home Depot contractors, the appliance manufacturer, the appliance repairman and the insurance company in order to solve the issues connected with purchasing a new appliance, with installation, from The Home Depot.WARNING: The Home Depot does not appear to stand behind their contractors.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 9, 28]}, "24": {"description": "gotta love having a home depot in your neighborhood!this is a fine store, stocked with probably most things you could ask for from home depot, and return policy if you order online is easy and straight forward.everytime i've gone i've found someone who's been really helpful wearing an orange apron--sometimes it's not the first person you ask, but you can't blame them for not knowing where everything in the store is, i mean it's huge.WARNING: \u00a0do not get your keys cut here. \u00a0i know they have a key cutting service, but the way they cut their keys make for less than precise copies. \u00a0go to a legit locksmith and they can make exact copies of your keys so you don't have issues with having to wiggle your keys in your locks.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 1, 10]}, "7": {"description": "The most frustrating 2 hours of my life trying to find just salt.

Every single roll we ordered lacked flavor and the quality of the food is noticeably subpar.We ordered a sweet potato, California, spicy tuna, Las Vegas, and the Red Dragon rolls, resulting in a free order of crab rangoon. Crab rangoon was basically just cream cheese in a greasy wonton, completely lacking in both flavor and the presence of crab. I should have know I was in for the second-worst sushi experience of my life (the first involved food poisoning) upon first glance of the California roll. Like with the crab rangoon, lack of crab! Hana pulls a cheap trick and mixes the crab with mayo to make a crab salad instead of using a solid crab stick. Just gross. The sweet potato roll is normally one of my favorites- this was just ok. The spicy tuna was unremarkable and tasted like watery wasabi. The Red Dragon tasted like old grease, and the Las Vegas was basically a bite of cream cheese wrapped in rice and covered in spicy mayo and a slice of jalapeno, which wasn't even spicy. Needless to say, I was completely disappointed with my Hana experience and will not be going back.

The floor manager refused to give me a receipt. I did get my order and it was correct this 3rd time I was in the store, but all of this started at the beginning of April and was completed correctly in May. That is a real shame.

A months ago, few friends and I went in for a few drinks before dinner. Cheap beer, no college kids, only ones there=perfect. The manager, Gino, was a bit creepy; he bought me a drink and kept talking to me even though my back was turned to him, but sometimes that comes with dive bar territory. Tonight was UNFORGIVABLE. There was a fight that broke out between the manager (Gino) and a few other bar flies. \u00a0My boyfriend and I were sitting by the door \u00a0and the manager shoved someone into our table, knocking over both our beers. I told my boyfriend \"let's go\" and the couple next to us, with wide eyes, nodded in agreement. The other girl's beer was knocked over onto her purse. I grabbed my coat and ducked around the 5-7 gentlemen who were grabbing each other's collars and yelling obscenities and got out through the door, but not before I was ELBOWED IN THE FACE. My lip is still swollen. \u00a0I got outside and dialed 9-11. As soon as I hung up with them, I turned, looking for my boyfriend.

I had the 2 combo sandwiches with mac n' cheese and coleslaw. I always get sauce on the side if I know the sauce wasn't integrated into the meat early on, otherwise, they just smother mediocre meat with flavorful sauce. In this case, I am glad I got side sauce, because the meat was pretty mediocre, and the sauce wasn't very good. I am on to something with my theory...The pulled pork held up flavor wise, but it was dry and with only 2 sauces to choose from, there was no respite from the chewing. My table started the running joke of calling the \"hot\" bbq sauce, the red top, because it was more fitting than in fact calling it \"hot.\" Both sauces were incredibly tangy, thin and lacking body. A good sauce would really alleviate people like me being critical of the meat, but lets be real, you're at a BBQ place, you should be critical of the meat. On to the weirdest part of the whole meal, the mac n' cheese and the coleslaw. I have never had either sides in such a way as Moxee served them. Normally, I order coleslaw to pair with my spicy/savory bbq, but in this case, the sauce was super mild and the coleslaw had jalapenos in it. The coleslaw lacked tang and had cilantro and tomatoes in it - it would have made a good salsa. THE MAC AND CHEESE! What did they serve me? My table called it mac soup, because it tasted like someone put pasta in a cream of mushroom soup with bread crumbs, lots and lots of bread crumbs. So many \u00a0in fact that much of them were dry even after being \"baked\" underneath the soup. Each bite was a cheese-less adventure with crouton-esque mouthfuls of clumpy crumbs. I dont know what they were thinking, but it was seriously off mark. All in all, i didnt have any expectations going in and Im glad because i would have been more dissapointed than I am now.

Taylor in Chicago, IL:1. While sitting in Bar 10 neither of two waitresses bothered to ask my friend nor I if we wanted a drink at all during our entire stay. 2. After being ignored at the table, I went to the bar to get a drink and was ignored by the female bartender who asked for my drink order three times before actually serving it. 3. Somehow between 12:45am and 1:15am the price of the same drink went up by a dollar. After calling their attention to the discrepancy, they stood by it and refused to correct the error. (I STILL tipped.)4. While trying to finish my drink at closing time, a bouncer proceeded to come to the table in a belligerent manner and demand that we leave. After telling him we were waiting on the manager to resolve the poor service at the bar, he became even MORE aggressive and put his hands in my friend's face and angrily pushed the table away from us. He then moved towards us as if to physically remove us from the establishment. 5. After reporting these incidents to management, they dismissed my concerns assuming I was an \"angry\" Black woman and attempted to patronize me without actually addressing the overarching concern of dismal customer service.I have NEVER in my life been treated with such discourtesy. \u00a0If you do go to this establishment, be prepared for a severe lack of hospitality, lackadaisical bar and wait staff, and unresponsive management.In fairness, there is one bartender there usually on Wednesdays and Sundays by the name of Kendall. \u00a0This gentleman is wonderful at what he does. \u00a0He is extremely hard working (I've seen him break out into a sweat while tending bar), very attentive, always provides service with a smile, remembers your face and drink (he may even surprise you with knowing your name), and truly understands the value of great customer service. \u00a0Whenever I am in his care, I am compelled to tip a minimum of 30%. \u00a0I hope to find out if there is another location where he works on other evenings.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 1, 31]}, "53": {"description": "Yep, it's a bar.

But, aside from a couple of minor issues, this place is pretty solid.Allow me to take you back - way back - into a time when I was just a young college kid myself. \u00a0We had a couple of places we frequented that we referred to as \"Vomitoriums\" because these bars were set up for serious partying and drinking. \u00a0These places were designed for maximum efficiency - nothing that spilling drinks or vomiting could stain or damage, so no light colours, no fabrics, no carpeting. \u00a0Instead, hard, dark surfaces that could be hosed down quick. \u00a0 Walking into the Bar 10 Doors and seeing the hard tile floor, the dark wood furniture, the cold utilitarian nature of it all, brought back some memories.

This seemed odd for a Saturday evening, but she was doing as good of a job as she could.We ordered the fried pickles. They were so close to being perfect. The problem was that they were cut into spears rather than chips, and the spears were simply too thick and juicy. \u00a0Had they slimmed them down they would have been amazing and the breading would have adhered to them better.Then I had the Tinga sandwich. The Tinga is served wrap-style and has Spicy chipotle marinated chicken, Romaine, Pico de gallo and Grilled Onions. \u00a0Problem is the sandwich was very heavy with raw onion. \u00a0Maybe it's just that I don't eat raw onions often, but it was really strong to me and sort of overpowered the rest of the ingredients. \u00a0Wasn't bad, per se, but nothing I would order again.But I do have to give them props for having a really fantastic Bloody Mary - loved how rich and dense it was, with a ton of spices and a ton of flavour. \u00a0Don't know if I would make a special trip down here again, but I would come back if I was in the area.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 1, 8]}, "30": {"description": "Last night was my second time visiting.

Not only were the tots topped with everything but the kitchen sink, the portion size of the appetizer was huge. It was a meal in itself. I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  For my entree I opted for the Chicken-Chorizo taco's. The chicken was delicious. I have no idea what kind of hybred meat this was. It almost had the taste of a Indian dish. Whatever it was, I really enjoyed it. These three small taco's packed quite a punch. It's a rare occasion where I couldn't finish them all. My left over taco also tasted excellent the next day.  Here's the bottom line: If you are looking for a bare bones, bar food experience with great food, friendly service and a sports bar vibe, head on down to the Bar 10 doors. My wife and I feasted like royalty for under $40 (including drinks). It's a great place to chill out and watch a game.

I was wearing an outfit that you could have painted on, but I still warranted a frisk. Okay, I can understand if they feel they can't make exceptions to the rules because then the rules mean nothing. If, however, you are going to make me take out my phone and demonstrate that it is indeed a phone and not an incendiary device, I expect you to have noticed the guy who smuggled in a hitter box that is larger than my phone, plus a lighter, plus a hip flask. Seriously. You're going to hassle me about my phone and then make me sit in a cloud of pot smoke with Stinky McStoner?Next, lines for drinks or the ATMs (if they are working) get very long. Alcohol and some other lines are cash-only and kind of pricey, so bring a wad. The beverage vendors that walk around while the bands play wear distracting blinking lights, are hard to get ahold of, and don't all have the same drinks. Choose them instead of braving the lines at your own risk.Then, there were sound issues with The National, who played first. Sometimes, I couldn't hear the horns. Other times, the horns drowned out the guitar. When one of the Butler Brothers came to sing a song with the band, they forgot to turn on his microphone. This was the second of three shows, so I thought this would have been ironed out already. Alas.On the bright side, there was a separate sound check for Arcade Fire, the sound issues were fixed before the first song began, and everything was great during their set.

I ended up only getting a stuffed cheese pretzel for $5 and it was fine.Other tips:-Parking for boxing events is $15.

They even have cold water and snacks for purchase up front (see others must spend a lot of time in here as well if they offer up refreshments!). The cashier was quick in getting us out of there as we did have a bit of a delay in trying to find the right computer desk in the warehouse. I was also a bit surprised that no one helped us out with the purchase other than to allow us to use their cart to get it out to the parking lot. I mean, this thing was bulky and heavy. But we managed and since they have their own parking lot I just backed up to the door and we loaded it in the car with no issues. I don't often have the chance to wander aimlessly through office supply stores- after all, at work, it is all ordered on line and boxes of whatever I need are at my disposal each and every work day.

If you want it, they probably have some version of what you are looking for.Needed a very specific bike chain tool, but no shop in the city seemed to have it, or those shops were not even open on a Sunday afternoon. So the fact that Kozy's is open until 6 PM, and that the shop tech said \"Yes, we have that\", I was very pleased because it meant I would be able to ride on the next morning. \u00a0 When I got there a salesperson offered me a chain tool, turned out that it was not compatible. He would have sold me the wrong tool had I not pointed it out. However, that is a very obscure fact that a salesperson would not be expected to know, and I only knew that myself by checking it versus a parts list. Wrong call on the tool. But the point is that he was trying to be nice by saving the customer money (the tool is fairly inexpensive and would cost only about about half as much as the labor). \u00a0Thus, what they meant on the phone is yes, they have it in the service shop, not for retail sale. And that was as I had expected. So, they shortened the chain to the correct number of links, without having to be told. Also, the other part we needed, they must have charged for at-cost, because there is no way they were making a profit on it at that price. \u00a0While I was waiting, I looked around. Some of these gadgets are of questionable utility (as in \"come on, does anyone really need this?\") but that's just the way the bike industry is today, not a reflection on the store. They have a large selection of bikes in terms of genre and price range. Not a broad selection of brands, which is also common, because a given bike store typically has contracts with specific companies. They have bike stands (inside the store) near the entrance where you can park your bikes, and high-quality floor pumps you can use to inflate your tires. Some ladies came in who, on the basis of the conversation, didn't know much about the technical aspects of bikes.

Woke up to a slow leak on my front tire and it was flat. Not a problem, I thought. I pulled the tire off, seated a new tube, pumped it up to 60 PSI and BANG, the whole thing exploded off the rim. Try again? I pulled the tire off, grabbed another new tube, seated it, had my bf check that it was done correctly, and started filling it slowly... as it creeped up above 40 PSI, it would start protruding under the tire bead... oy.So the bf drives me to the train, I head to work, and stop in to Kozy's on my lunch break. I head to the service counter and relay what I've tried and the nonsense that's going on. The service tech takes a look, gets the tire and tube all seated properly and rolls it back out to me. No way. My bf and I literally spent 45 min checking it and he got it in less than 5 min? A wee bit embarrassed of my skills, I thank him and ride 10 min back to work.

From baskets (didn't have what I wanted) to $65 anti-theft bicycle skewers (preying on a bike theft victim, anyone?) to more expensive bike locks than I wanted to purchase, OSM had dollar signs in his eyes the minute I walked in the door. Some particularly odious techniques:1. OSM tries to sell me the skewers. \"You never would have gotten your bike stolen in the first place if you would have had these!\" Yeah, thanks, I needed some salt rubbed in my fresh wound.2. OSM calls over dude-bro bike riding friend (DBBRF) to tell me how great the skewers are. \"I'd never ride without them! Check them out!\" DBBRF brings his own bike over to show me how they work. Thanks but no thanks. I wasn't prepared to be tag teamed.3. I tell OSM that I'm disappointed that this model didn't have the compass on it, like my old model. \"You could buy a new one!\" Thank but no thanks.4. After picking out a bike lock, OSM tells me that the one I picked was inadequate, and upsells me on another lock for $14 more.And the obnoxious sales technique winner goes to....5. After appearing budget conscious (who isn't these days), OSM asks me what I do for a living. Really? Is this any of your business? Then he proceeds to ask me what I study in school, where I plan to get a job, etc. etc. Dude - I came in for a bike, not to answer questions about my personal life. Oh!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't up to my expectations. I went there about two weeks ago and it was on a Friday. My interest to go to Rosebud was serious! Every time I would pass through Taylor street it would be crowded, so I figured this place would be exceptional. I ordered Chicken Parmesan. I was in the mood for something simple and so I thought that what I ordered would be extra delicious since it's a simple dish. The portion of the food was a very generous amount. I have no complains. My main disappointment was the fact that the sauce was simply not as saucy, and it was a little on the bland side. How could Chicken Parmesan go wrong? Overpriced as well. Out all things on the menu why would something this simple not be delicious in an authentic Italian restaurant? It's very weird to say that the sauce wasn't saucy enough because the chicken had a good amount of sauce in it but it wasn't thick and rich in texture and flavor.

They did not feel that my 3-star review of the service was indicative of their typical dining experience. I obliged to give them a second chance and I am glad that I did. The poor service we received must have been a fluke event as our second experience was great. This time we opted to sit inside rather than out on the patio. I would highly recommend taking this approach. Their interior is decorated well and the sounds of Sinatra playing sound much better than the traffic. The interior tables also come stocked with parmesan cheese to mix with the olive oil (for bread dipping) while their patio tables just have olive oil. To start, we got the bruschetta which was one of the better ones we've tried. Although it had too many tomatoes for my liking, the fresh mozzarella and slight char-broiled taste of the toasted bread delighted the taste buds. For our entr\u00e9es, we ordered the pasta carbonara and chicken Marsala. Both were delicious and were more food than we could eat in one sitting. Although we were getting full, Amy, our friendly and attentive waitress, suggested we try the chocolate mousse cake. It was very good and would be a good choice for any chocolate lover.

While the busser ran around filling water glasses, the waiter avoided our table as much as he could. When he took our order, I asked for some butter for the bread. It wasn't until he brought our food out and I asked again about the butter that he finally brought. This wouldn't be an issue had they been busy. However, this was 3PM and there were only 3 tables needing service. The bread was good and definitely worth the wait. Likewise, the ziti was fantastic. \u00a0A must try if you like lots of cheese. The restaurant itself was nice and worthy of 5 stars. The service was not, hence the compromise on 4 stars. I would recommend giving it a try.

They did not feel that my 3-star review of the service was indicative of their typical dining experience. I obliged to give them a second chance and I am glad that I did. The poor service we received must have been a fluke event as our second experience was great. This time we opted to sit inside rather than out on the patio. I would highly recommend taking this approach. Their interior is decorated well and the sounds of Sinatra playing sound much better than the traffic. The interior tables also come stocked with parmesan cheese to mix with the olive oil (for bread dipping) while their patio tables just have olive oil. To start, we got the bruschetta which was one of the better ones we've tried. Although it had too many tomatoes for my liking, the fresh mozzarella and slight char-broiled taste of the toasted bread delighted the taste buds. For our entr\u00e9es, we ordered the pasta carbonara and chicken Marsala. Both were delicious and were more food than we could eat in one sitting. Although we were getting full, Amy, our friendly and attentive waitress, suggested we try the chocolate mousse cake. It was very good and would be a good choice for any chocolate lover. When we received the invitation to return to the restaurant, I refrained from informing them on when I would be back as to not skew our experience. Without knowing I was a returning, underwhelmed customer, the wait staff provided us a superb dining experience. I'm glad we came back.

What we found was great ziti but mediocre service. The busser, who moderately reminded me of Lloyd from Entourage, was great. He was friendly and hard working. Our waiter, however, was not. While the busser ran around filling water glasses, the waiter avoided our table as much as he could. When he took our order, I asked for some butter for the bread. It wasn't until he brought our food out and I asked again about the butter that he finally brought. This wouldn't be an issue had they been busy. However, this was 3PM and there were only 3 tables needing service. The bread was good and definitely worth the wait. Likewise, the ziti was fantastic. \u00a0A must try if you like lots of cheese. The restaurant itself was nice and worthy of 5 stars. The service was not, hence the compromise on 4 stars. I would recommend giving it a try.

When it comes down to it, good quality work is more important then the actual customer service you get, but I prefer both to be above par.I decided to take advantage of their Tuesday \"name day\" special. Meaning, that instead of overpaying (as you do at most Chicago tattoo shops) for some simple script, I only had to pay twenty bucks (normally this amount of cash would get you a black dot, tip not included). So that's a pretty hot deal, even though it does not come without cost. Even though it doesn't say it on the shop's website, there are a number of restrictions as to where you can get the tattoo for the \"special price.\" We're not talking extra for your forehead or palm of hand, but pretty common tattoo spots, such as rib, stomach, chest, back of neck. Luckily for me, these exceptions did not apply, but I would have been irritated if I came all the way down expecting it.Next came the LOOOOOOOOONG wait. I understand that I am not the only cheap ass in Chicago, but seriously the place was tiny, has seating for about four, and was completely packed. Good for the owner/artists that they are popular, but I know for a FACT that someone (if not more than one) came in asking for a tattoo w/ no appointment after me and was brought in back about five or six people before me. Not. Cool. I also understand that there were a lot of fools wanting to come in and get any old thing permanently needled into their skin just because it was a deal (dude who got the \"Mr. 4.0 G.P.A\" tattoo and then yelled out \"see y'all again next Tuesday!\" made my day- and the wait almost worth it!), HOWEVER it wasn't my suggestion for the shop to do monotonous tattoos all day for cheap, so I did not appreciate the snottiness of at least three of the artists working there, just because they were busy and their artistic abilities weren't challenged. They didn't make any effort to chat or be friendly during the process. Really now, the mightier than thou tattoos artist act has been done to death. Other not good things:-It is so small in back that friends are not allowed to come with you. I don't need anybody to hold my hand, but when I get something that I can only see by looking behind me in a mirror, I want a friend to reassure me that it's straight.

I basically had to walk to the front room full of people with my shirt half off to get it checked.- They don't have professional chairs like most shops, so you are forced to either stand or sit in uncomfortable ways while getting your tattoo. This would not be good if it was a large piece.- After we waited forever, they rushed us and seemed annoyed when we asked for any tweaks/suggestions.Anyway, I like my tattoo, it was well done. My roommate got a colorful sparrow, which also looks very nice. The artists also became friendlier after we tipped (it didn't seem like many there were doing so, which would piss me off too).

From here on out, it'll be Jeff, my husband:Taylor Street Tattoo is where you go to get tattooed. I know how simple that sounds. How elementary. But that's all that really needs to be said. If you want some bullcrap fake garbage go somewhere else. If you want a tattoo by people who know how to do it right and have no problems being honest, go here. I've only had 1 tattoo done here, about a year ago by \"Turbo\" (Chris.) I've been too busy/broke to get another one. The pricing is dead on, in the city (where taxes/insurance/rent is much higher) the prices do not get better unless you know some schmuck doing them in his bathroom at home. You get what you pay for. I've seen more expensive shops that have had way worse work rolling out. You will not get better work in this city, especially for the prices.Again, it's a tattoo shop. No glitz, no bullcrap, real honest people, be respectful and they'll respect you. If they're busy tattooing someone, wait, would you want your artist to stop mid work to go talk to someone else? Just wait or comeback or make an appointment. Not a big stink. It has the atmosphere a tattoo shop should have. Honesty and hard work.I've only decided to write this review because I feel there are too many negative reviews for this place and unjustly so (in my opinion.) I'll be going back soon. I'll upload a pic of what I had done too. Turbo had very little to work with source wise (black and white blurry line drawing) and made it come to life. If I had the cash and time I'd have returned a million times by now. But I do try to push everyone this way.OH, also I noticed yelp says they take credit cards. When I went, cash only.

First I would like to say that it's a really cute shop nice seating area nice and quiet. Also, I love the concept of build your own cupcake. Now to talk about what I came for, I went to the Skinny Piggy for cupcakes because they had such good reviews. First off the cashier wasn't even present when I walked in, when she did come out she didn't acknowledge me. Then I walked toward the register and said hello, she said I'm finishing off a order I will be right with you. The cupcakes on display didn't look appetizing they weren't decorated because of the build your own purpose I guess. The cupcakes themselves were really one noted. I ordered a strawberry cupcake and a salted Carmel cupcake I didn't like the fact that the cupcakes were not filled the only thing salted Carmel on the cupcake was the little Carmel they put on the top the rest of the cupcake was plain had absolutely no flavor and then the strawberry cupcake I ate it and asked myself what flavor was that supposed to be. All the icings was the same texture and flavor who ever does that baking here needs to go back to the drawing board. I would not go back to this place nor do I recommend this place.

In my opinion, the true element which separates The Skinny Piggy from all of the alternatives is the level of customer service provided by Monica, the owner. \u00a0First Encounter: I stopped by one day to sample the goods, in anticipation of placing a larger order for my girlfriend's birthday party. Upon entering, I was drawn to the display of various cupcakes with frosting and topping options as I tried to figure out how this all worked. I was greeted by Monica and she explained the concept. After an awkward silence, I decided to go with the salted caramel and the lemon drop. I had the option to pick any frosting and topping, but I went with the standard and the frosting was applied right before my eyes. The Cupcakes: The cupcakes were very moist and the frosting was a perfect compliment. The salted caramel even had some type of caramel center that was a great bonus of added flavor. The lemon drop was also exactly how I imagined a perfect lemon cupcake to be; moist and lemony, without being overly sweet. No compaints at all. And with all this in mind, I decided to place a large order for the party. The Crisis: \u00a0 \u00a0 So, I returned the following week to pick up an order of 1 dozen cupcakes, 4 different flavors: Red Velvet, Lemon, Salted Caramel and The Evil Twin (chocolate filled with cheesecake - my new favorite). The order was ready to go as promised, and I was off to drop the cakes off at the party location. Upon arrival, I reached over to grab the box of deliciousness - and the box fell over and all the cupcakes toppled around until they looked like a horrible science experiment gone wrong. I made a feeble attempt to re-arrange them in the box, to no avial. They were ruined and I did not know what to do. As I stared at what I assumed to be a wasted investment (these things were not cheap), I decided to try my luck and call Monica and explain what happened. To my surprise, she recommended that I bring them back and she would see what she could do. To make a long story a little shorter, she fixed them. She literally repaired and replaced each cupcake. I tried to give her more money to show my appreciation, but she would not accept. And this is what I mean by excellent customer service. Would the same thing happen if I had gone to a different bakery? Who knows, but I am glad I decided to go to the Skinny Piggy. The Aftermath:The party was a hit and the cupcakes were the star of the show. A few friends asked where I got them and informed me that they would be sure to stop by the next time they plan an event or when they are in the area. I would highly recommend it. Not only are the cupcakes delicious and the options almost endless, but you are guaranteed to receive exemplary service.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 9, 17]}, "27": {"description": "Monica, the owner was very welcoming and friendly and waited on us personally.

Luckily, visiing this particular location of Mattress Firm is actually much better than finding the world's largest emerald; it's more rewarding, more refreshing, more exhilarating and way more life changing--way more. Buying a Mattress from the men who work here is likened to when a man puts on the Three Wolf Moon t-shirt: everything just gets better and you instantly become more attractive to the opposite sex. Overall, you just start winning at life.On the rainy Monday morning that I decided to make my visit to Mattress Firm, I had no idea that my life would be forever changed. When I walked in with my Chicago Bulls tank top on, I was greeted with a \"BULLS!\" Initially, I thought this young, spirited man was yelling \"BALLS!\" at me (which I would have equally enjoyed, if not more) but then I remembered my shirt and realized this man was simply excited about the sport of basketball. His name was Joe and he quickly became the missing link in my life. Joe not only knows more about mattresses then the inventor of the mattress, he also knows a great deal about thread count in sheets. You'd be surprised how useful all of the knowledge Joe retains is. I actually felt my IQ go up 30 points after our first conversation. Additionally, Joe has swagger and was wearing his suit and tie like he was doing it a favor. Although Joe was not my main contact for my mattress sale, he was just as helpful, humorous and overall a joy to be around. Did I mention I got smarter from just standing next to him? Because yeah, I definitely did. (Most of the big words I am using in this review were taught to me by Joe).For as many great things as I have to say about Joe, I can say just as many incredibly wonderful things about Antonio. As you can see from reading other reviews, Antonio is the PROM KING of this Mattress Firm. He is the guy in high school whose locker you REALLY WANTED to be next to yours; and when you found it was, you basically died, then came back to life because you couldn't possibly have daily locker conversations with Antonio from the grave. Antonio is fit, strong like bull and very charming. I imagine he sells mattresses just by staring at humans; his charisma is similar to that of the love child of Harrison Ford circa 1982 and a panther. My experience at this location would not have been the same had it not been for Antonio; he is the part of your life that you never knew was missing. You can only know this by going to meet Antonio and I instruct you to run, not walk, to do so.As wonderful as both Joe and Anotnio were, my Mattress Firm trip was pushed over the edge of \"this is the greatest day of my life\" by Justin. Justin exceeded every single expectation I had for buying a mattress. I thought I was going to walk in and hear about springs, and coils and good night sleeps but Justin wasn't having this. He not only applauded my goal of wanting to lie down on every single mattress in the store, he encouraged it and cheered me on as I did so. He made sure I was comfortable & carefully and meticulously guided me through the difference between each type of mattress and demonstrated sleeping positions that were so graceful and amazing, I would have thought he was a modern dancer at Joffrey. This guy possesses the sense of humor of every best Match.com date you've ever been on; this allows you to make your mattress selection while simultaneously burning calories via laughter. He also wears a ring that has powers like the Schwartz ring on Spaceballs, only better. He uses this ring for good and not for evil. Justin will not only inform you about what he believes will ultimately the best choice for you sleep wise, but he will also help you through the financial aspects of purchasing the mattress as well. In my case, Justin actually made it RAIN money inside the mattress store; this was partially due to his dance moves and also due to the moment where he took a blade to one pillow and ripped out a wad of one hundred dollar bills. He gave them to me with a hug then asked if he could brush my hair; naturally I said yes. It was through this, along with his ability to give me the absolute BEST possible price he was able to give, that I could afford my amazing new mattress. Where as Antonio is the Prom King of this Mattress Firm, Justin is the Barack Obama. He doesn't need to be Prom King; he is leader of the free world and he will give you the best night's sleep you've ever had to prove it.Truly, these guys are top notch; if you want a good time, don't call someone's Mom--go to this Mattress Firm. You'll not only get a better deal than you imagined, you'll get smarter, lose weight, suddenly become irresistible to the opposite-and same-sex, and have a memory you can tell your great grandchildren about.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 28]}, "47": {"description": "We had a really great experience at Back to Bed!

Luckily, visiing this particular location of Mattress Firm is actually much better than finding the world's largest emerald; it's more rewarding, more refreshing, more exhilarating and way more life changing--way more. Buying a Mattress from the men who work here is likened to when a man puts on the Three Wolf Moon t-shirt: everything just gets better and you instantly become more attractive to the opposite sex. Overall, you just start winning at life.On the rainy Monday morning that I decided to make my visit to Mattress Firm, I had no idea that my life would be forever changed. When I walked in with my Chicago Bulls tank top on, I was greeted with a \"BULLS!\" Initially, I thought this young, spirited man was yelling \"BALLS!\" at me (which I would have equally enjoyed, if not more) but then I remembered my shirt and realized this man was simply excited about the sport of basketball. His name was Joe and he quickly became the missing link in my life. Joe not only knows more about mattresses then the inventor of the mattress, he also knows a great deal about thread count in sheets. You'd be surprised how useful all of the knowledge Joe retains is. I actually felt my IQ go up 30 points after our first conversation. Additionally, Joe has swagger and was wearing his suit and tie like he was doing it a favor. Although Joe was not my main contact for my mattress sale, he was just as helpful, humorous and overall a joy to be around. Did I mention I got smarter from just standing next to him? Because yeah, I definitely did. (Most of the big words I am using in this review were taught to me by Joe).For as many great things as I have to say about Joe, I can say just as many incredibly wonderful things about Antonio. As you can see from reading other reviews, Antonio is the PROM KING of this Mattress Firm. He is the guy in high school whose locker you REALLY WANTED to be next to yours; and when you found it was, you basically died, then came back to life because you couldn't possibly have daily locker conversations with Antonio from the grave. Antonio is fit, strong like bull and very charming. I imagine he sells mattresses just by staring at humans; his charisma is similar to that of the love child of Harrison Ford circa 1982 and a panther. My experience at this location would not have been the same had it not been for Antonio; he is the part of your life that you never knew was missing. You can only know this by going to meet Antonio and I instruct you to run, not walk, to do so.As wonderful as both Joe and Anotnio were, my Mattress Firm trip was pushed over the edge of \"this is the greatest day of my life\" by Justin. Justin exceeded every single expectation I had for buying a mattress. I thought I was going to walk in and hear about springs, and coils and good night sleeps but Justin wasn't having this. He not only applauded my goal of wanting to lie down on every single mattress in the store, he encouraged it and cheered me on as I did so. He made sure I was comfortable & carefully and meticulously guided me through the difference between each type of mattress and demonstrated sleeping positions that were so graceful and amazing, I would have thought he was a modern dancer at Joffrey. This guy possesses the sense of humor of every best Match.com date you've ever been on; this allows you to make your mattress selection while simultaneously burning calories via laughter. He also wears a ring that has powers like the Schwartz ring on Spaceballs, only better. He uses this ring for good and not for evil. Justin will not only inform you about what he believes will ultimately the best choice for you sleep wise, but he will also help you through the financial aspects of purchasing the mattress as well. In my case, Justin actually made it RAIN money inside the mattress store; this was partially due to his dance moves and also due to the moment where he took a blade to one pillow and ripped out a wad of one hundred dollar bills. He gave them to me with a hug then asked if he could brush my hair; naturally I said yes. It was through this, along with his ability to give me the absolute BEST possible price he was able to give, that I could afford my amazing new mattress. Where as Antonio is the Prom King of this Mattress Firm, Justin is the Barack Obama. He doesn't need to be Prom King; he is leader of the free world and he will give you the best night's sleep you've ever had to prove it.Truly, these guys are top notch; if you want a good time, don't call someone's Mom--go to this Mattress Firm. You'll not only get a better deal than you imagined, you'll get smarter, lose weight, suddenly become irresistible to the opposite-and same-sex, and have a memory you can tell your great grandchildren about.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 28]}, "10": {"description": "First time buying a bed.

LuLu's has been around a long time. How can an 'insider' tell? Its street address is on Leavitt St. But Leavitt St. doesn't run by it any more. It was cul-de-sac'd a half-block north. LuLu's is now on the southwest corner of Ogden Ave. & Taylor St. Another way you can tell it has been around a long time is go inside and notice a reproduction of a Chicago Sun-Times readers' responses to one of Pat Bruno's fast-service-restaurant articles. It dates from 1983. You should recognize a familiar name represented thereupon.Was it a good hot dog? Yes, it was. The size here has always been the 'tens'. It was the best hot dog value in the city. Back in 1983, _not many people_ knew about it. Back then, the standard was a branded David Berg hot dog. David Berg ultimately was bought out by Vienna Sausage Mfg. Co., and whatever brand hot dog is being served here now is unknown to me. (It may even be not strictly kosher.)Is it still the best hot dog in the city? Sorry, no. But the bar has been raised considerably in the subsequent years. Lulu's is _still_ one of the best hot dog _values_ in the city. Two hot dogs will now cost you $3.25. The french fries are still institutional, but they're well prepared, and you get a reasonable quantity of them. (I won't spoil this review by otherwise mentioning other hot dog stands where it seems the amount of french fries you get with the \"special\" are strictly rationed to try and compel you to buy an additional order.)There are now a number of other entrees, including hamburgers, shrimp, catfish, perch, and chicken offered in a combination special. Amazingly for the neighborhood, there is a free parking lot aside. It is open until 11:00 pm on Monday - Thursday, 1:00 am on Friday & Saturday, and 10:00 pm on Sunday. Another aspect which has changed over the past quarter-century is that in 1983, I would not have attempted to walk the four blocks from the Blue Line \"L\"'s Illinois Medical District station [Damen exit].

The owner is mostly at the register (old lady) and she always recognizes me even though I don't come as often anymore. There were a couple times I didn't have cash (they are CASH ONLY), and she gave me the food and said pay her later. Now, I always get the Fish sandwich (with giardiniera) and it tastes really good! I love it. I don't get anything else besides that, but my UIC buddies never complained about their other food. However, I gave a minus one star because the fries aren't that great. They don't taste horrible, but you have to dip it in ketchup to eat it (like I can eat McDonalds fries without Ketchup but not these). Also, I don't think this place is really made for others besides UIC students, you can't park outside the restaurant because it's all zone parking (you need a residential sticker). So you would have to park on Taylor street and walk here. Also, this place is surrounded by Apartments, so it stands alone (I guess they were trying to be as close as possible to UIC).

This made me believe that I wouldn't like the Nutella version. I was totally wrong. The Nutella was the bomb! So truly delicious! I could have eaten more of them.

We have problems whenever we order from them. Despite being literally a block and a half or so away from us, they always take more than 45 minutes to deliver, completely ignoring their 30 minute rule, and many times our pizza is lukewarm, and once in a while it's cold. We don't really hold that against them though because it is the city and we're used to having to wait that long for food (though not from places that close to us). I guess as far as that goes we're just jealous of our friends in Naperville who get apologies and vouchers anytime they're late in delivering.Anyway, our main problem really is that they're not good workers. They forget our coke (and sometimes other things) about 98% of the time and have only offered to take it off of our bill once, though nicely one delivery guy brought it back to us, which we appreciated(not that they're far). Now, I love greek salads. I tried to order them twice because it appears on the menu. Makes sense, no? No. It actually doesn't make sense. You see, as the last delivery guy informed us, they don't actually have the ingredients for Greek or Caesar salad at their location. Do you think the woman answering the phone could have told us that? Of course not. Because she deemed it totally acceptable to just send the only salad they do have (it's not, I would've have preferred she just be upfront and say they don't have Greek salads). So I sent it back because I did not order it. And then not only was it the poor delivery guy who had to tell us that, but then he told us that WE THE CUSTOMER had to report it to Domino's corporate. It took me forever to locate a place to report it, but I did. As part of the Domino's corporation, that is something that they should have done themselves ages ago, and I still have no recognition from corporate that they know or are dealing with that issue. I can't be the only one ordering Greek Salads. I almost called back after the last time to find out from the lady why she didn't bother to tell me they didn't have the ingredients, but I knew it wouldn't do me any good. This is a simple thing to do I would think.Unfortunately, this is the closest Domino's to us, so if we want it again, we'll have to order from there.

We stumbled upon this gem and I couldn't figure out how this place had almost 5 stars - that's unheard of. I guess we had to come see for ourselves.The first night we were greeted by Mike who kept us company and kept great conversation with us. He offered a LOT of advice on places to go, things to see and do in the area. I was stunned by how impressive their beer list was, not only cans and bottles but also amazing beer on tap.The second night was even more fun than the first. We walked in and noticed a different bartender at the front.... Mike came out of nowhere to welcome us back and make us feel at home with an intro to our bartender that night, Ryan over a round of shots. Wow, where else do you get treated like a regular on your second visit?! This night was also sick. Ryan did an awesome job of getting our drinks, making recommendations and helping us navigate what we were doing in Chicago.The last night we met yet another new bartender, Ben. We asked about Ryan and were told he was on his way. Ryan later joined us and he and Ben did a great job of service and keeping us company - they have a great sense of humor and play subtle tricks on regulars there which is hilarious to watch play out. In true PhD form, we ended the night with a round of shots on the house (I was getting used to this - really miss my nightly free shot =/)We were really impressed by the atmosphere, drink list, lounge in the back of the bar and the outdoor patio (which I never spent any time on and somewhat regret it.) \u00a0The one thing that makes this place absolutely incredible is the bar staff who I can't wait to come back to visit.

Skedaddle. Buh-bye.First, April, yeah. You WERE trying to be rude.Second. Trying to rush us out proves you're inexperienced, classless and tactless.Third, being that rude and bitchy was a guarantee that you killed your tip AND just for that, how about we're gonna stay an extra half-hour and make you serve us coffee the whole time, because you know what? We're.Not.Done.Yet.The owner (who DID recognize me) came over and apologized and told us to stay as long as we wanted. Even he was like, \"Hello?

Each sandwich costs around $7 and comes with a variety of ingredients that will make you reconsider the peanut butter and jelly sandwich you brought to work.I've ordered the Honey Grilled Pork for my first sandwich, and that was classic! The bun was nicely toasted and portions were great. Ask for extra cilantro on your sandwich! The second time I got the fried tofu banh mi, and that one was just as amazing. Large pieces of tofu with thin sweet potato fries tucked inside. I loved both of them.They also serve up some fantastic vermicelli bowls. You select your type of noodle, sauce, meat, and condiments to create your own bowl. I must say that the chicken here is on point.Let's not forget the quality of their boba too. Chicago seems to love fruit smoothie boba, and the ones at Lotus are all made from fresh fruit! For less than $4, I got myself a mango-avocado smoothie with boba, and I couldn't be happier! The drink was damn refreshing, and the flavors blended so well together. As for the boba pearls themselves, they weren't stale or rubbery, making it easy to drink.So while it's not the most classic style banh mi with the pate, meats, cilantro, and veggies, it still offers a fantastic new American take on one of my favorite kinds of sandwiches out there.

We had a taste for some Vietnamese sandwiches and planned on doing carry out. When I went to drop my wife off in front, I noticed a sign that said \"Free Parking\". I was so excited about this offer that I told my wife we were dinning in today. The free parking is a nice feature and it will hopefully help all of the businesses around this area by bringing in customers. The sandwich shop is small on the inside but very clean. I noticed some of those college students hanging around using the wifi. This isn't a Starbucks. As a business owner, it would drive me crazy with one person taking up two table spots. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with such problems. We almost fell victim to not getting a seat because there were many solo eaters surfing the internet at two top tables. While we were waiting for our food, a table in the back opened up and we jumped on it. We almost had to go back to our original plan of going with carry out sandwiches because of the lack of seats. Prior to arriving here we made a plan. We were going to order two sandwiches and then split them. We went with the Honey Grilled Pork Banh Mi with Pork shoulder, lemongrass, honey, garlic, scallions, pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro & jalapenos. Our second sandwich was the Sunny-Side Beef Banh Mi with Saut\u00e9ed beef, caramelized onion, sunny-side up egg, and crispy sweet potato fries. Both sandwiches were really good and full of flavor. If I had the choice I would definitely order the Honey Grilled Pork Banh Mi again. The sandwich had the perfect mix of savory, sweet & spicy. I loved every single bite. I was also glad that I chose to eat this sandwich second because it was amazing. My other half sandwich was the Sunny-Side Beef Banh Mi and it was good. I wish that the beef quality was a little better. There is nothing worse then pulling out inedible fat chunks from your mouth full of food. It just makes eating a sandwich an unpleasant experience. Every sandwich bite becomes a challenge because I'm not sure what I will find in there. It's like eating a fish with bones in it. The fish is good but you eat with caution. Would we come back here? Probably because of the close location and the free parking. If I was a college student I would definitely be in here a lot using the wifi and eating sandwiches. My only suggestion to the solo flying college students is to sit in the window counter. This way you're not taking up two seats.

Each sandwich costs around $7 and comes with a variety of ingredients that will make you reconsider the peanut butter and jelly sandwich you brought to work.I've ordered the Honey Grilled Pork for my first sandwich, and that was classic! The bun was nicely toasted and portions were great. Ask for extra cilantro on your sandwich! The second time I got the fried tofu banh mi, and that one was just as amazing. Large pieces of tofu with thin sweet potato fries tucked inside. I loved both of them.They also serve up some fantastic vermicelli bowls. You select your type of noodle, sauce, meat, and condiments to create your own bowl. I must say that the chicken here is on point.Let's not forget the quality of their boba too. Chicago seems to love fruit smoothie boba, and the ones at Lotus are all made from fresh fruit! For less than $4, I got myself a mango-avocado smoothie with boba, and I couldn't be happier! The drink was damn refreshing, and the flavors blended so well together. As for the boba pearls themselves, they weren't stale or rubbery, making it easy to drink.So while it's not the most classic style banh mi with the pate, meats, cilantro, and veggies, it still offers a fantastic new American take on one of my favorite kinds of sandwiches out there.

It make me feel appreciated and comfortable. \u00a0I highly recommend this place for any occasion (first date, birthday parties or just after work to have some sangrias). \u00a0Sometimes they have live music what is a plus :).", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 5]}, "56": {"description": "We will never go back here again. \u00a0You get one chance to make a good first impression and this place definitely did not impress. \u00a0We were so angry after dinner, I had to get up this morning and write this review. \u00a0Get the scoop below.We made an 8:30 pm reservation last night for dinner for two. \u00a0We arrived early around 8:15pm and the hostess was nowhere to be found for a couple of minutes. \u00a0When she came back to the hostess station I told her that we were there for our reservation and then she walked away again to check out tables and to talk with the chef I think. \u00a0She eventually came back and did not say anything to us. \u00a0At this point I told her that we would order a drink at the bar and wait for our table to which she said \"Okay, you can go over there then.\" \u00a0I don't know if she is younger or does not work as a hostess regularly but she seemed lost. \u00a0The restaurant was busy and we made our way over \u00a0to the bar.From here it took us 10 minutes to order a drink and another 10 to have it set in front of us. \u00a0I must say that our drinks were very good and we enjoyed those. \u00a0My wife and I had some conversation and then noted that we we had been waiting 40 minutes past our scheduled reservation for a table. \u00a0By this time other folks had checked in for their reservations and came to the bar to order drinks. \u00a0I had noticed that 3-4 other tables that came in after us were seated prior to us. \u00a0The hostess I spoke about before called me by the wrong name twice when asked about \u00a0our table. \u00a0We were about to get up and leave the restaurant when our table was finally given to us.From there the hostess came to seat us and upon us sitting down she asked if we knew what we wanted to order. \u00a0 We were so ticked off at this point that we just ordered some things (Mind you not as much as we were originally going to order as we had lost our appetite with the bad service). \u00a0We asked the hostess if we could order drinks as well and she told us our waitress would be by. \u00a0The minutes ticked by and our waitress arrived to take our drink orders. \u00a0She didn't introduce herself or tell us anything about the restaurant or specials.We both sat and waited trying to maintain composure as our date night was already ruined. \u00a0Our food started to come out and after we started to eat, our drinks came out. \u00a0Bear in mind that I ordered a beer and the wife a sangria. \u00a0These should have come out quickly. \u00a0Now onto the review of the food dish by dish. \u00a0I can't remember the proper names for the dishes, nor will I waste anymore time trying to find the names.Curry Chicken - Not bad but curry was not pronounced. \u00a0It was a yellow curry and decent to eat with bread. \u00a0The chicken was not spectacular but was cooked fine.Eggplant Stack - INEDIBLE. \u00a0Came out cold and way undercooked. \u00a0This is a sin when you are Italian. \u00a0It's unacceptable. \u00a0My wife and I couldn't eat it.Bacon Wrapped Dates - Decent but I've had the same thing a million times before and there was nothing notable about these.Pork Belly - The fat was not rendered down enough and was chewy. \u00a0Nuff said. \u00a0There are 10,000 more places to get pork belly in this city. \u00a0Go to Takashi and have it and then try it here. \u00a0You'll weep, and not in a good way.Beef Tip Skewers - Flavor was decent but they weren't very hot. \u00a0Seemed like our food was an afterthought and being rushed to the table without being completed. \u00a0Our server never asked us how the food was or really seemed to care that much. \u00a0This place was busy and I'm not sure they have the skilled employees to handle a rush without crashing and burning. \u00a0The wife and I go out quite a bit to eat so we know what to expect. \u00a0My wife also runs a high volume food & drink service establishment and knows how to treat customers. \u00a0Even though I can normally overlook some things she tends to notice, I could not here. \u00a0It was just \u00a0BAD.The cherry on top of the evening was that the best and fastest service we received is when we asked for the check. \u00a0Our waitress was right there ready to put it on the table so they could turn it for other customers. \u00a0There were dirty dishes all over the table and she didn't even think to clear them when she brought the check. \u00a0With our date night ruined, I forked over a 10% tip and I'm not even sure that was deserved.Again, you have one chance to gain a new repeat customer or to turn them off and have them tell all their friends about it. \u00a0Too bad for this place that the situation was the latter. \u00a0We spend A LOT of money going out to eat and bringing our friends with us. \u00a0This place won't be seeing us again. \u00a0We'll stick with the places we know are good in that area. \u00a0Three Aces, County BBQ, Dusek's/Punch House, etc. \u00a0Those folks know how to treat a customer and offer a great product.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 3, 23]}, "29": {"description": "I came here with my mom while visiting and we had a pretty good time.

I love it when places actually put liquor into the Sangria in addition to the wine that's already in there. I had the empanadas de picadillo which were so delicious. They were so small and cute. There were about four empandas on my plate. They were very flavorful and I loved the savory with a little bit of sweet since the empanadas had raisins inside. We also had the albondigas which were two meatballs in a plate of tomato soup with two pieces of bread. The tomato soup and bread was awesome! The meatballs were kind of chewy and had these little white pieces that I had to spit out. My husband also ordered the patatas bravas and chorizo and camarron pinchos. Both of those were excellent and the shrimp had a nice grilled smokiness to it. The potatoes were just the right amount of spicy and were delicious. I had a lamb dish on skewers that I cant remember the name of. The lamb meat was a little tough but very flavorful. Overall I love the ambiance of this place and they have great service.

The food was delicious, though the caipirinha I ordered wasn't prepared properly (they did not muddle the lime, but instead threw whole lime chunks in the drink and there was no mint to speak of--yeah, that's not how this works).Our waiter (initials VM) apparently had better things to do last night and couldn't wait for us to leave. Out celebrating a friend's birthday, we both arrived by 9:15 pm. From the moment I sat down, I felt rushed to leave, though their website states they don't close until 11 pm on Thursday nights. By 9:30 pm he told us the kitchen was being shut down. Really? The place was empty, so, yes, I can understand getting a move on with cleaning up early, etc. I don't begrudge the efficiency, but not at the expense of rushing paying customers out the door. It's a tapas bar. You are supposed to order small plates throughout the evening, not all at once. We could have easily spent more than $100, but he capped us at less than half that because he wanted to go home.And speaking of the door, as soon as we stepped across the threshold onto the sidewalk, he unceremoniously locked the door behind us immediately (it made a really loud clicking sound). Mind you, by this time it was 10:30 pm, a full half hour before closing time.As a restaurant review is as much about the food as the service, I will not be back. The only reason why it is a 2-star review is because I liked the food. If based on service alone it would be zero. (And yes, I did still tip 15%. He's lucky he got that.

The tabbouleh was almost an olive oil soup. Seriously, there must have been at least a cup of olive oil in this small tabbouleh salad. I ate the non-soupy parts which were fine but it was so gross having gotten oil everywhere and the rest of it was non-edible. The lentil soup was odd. Mostly broth and few lentils. Kind of soapy/frothy on the top. Didn't taste right. It was all really gross. I will say that they were setting up a lunch buffet when I got there that looked okay and apparently includes different items each day.

The very first time we went it was amazing and hit the spot. I ordered the lamb shank special and it was pretty good. The actual lamb shank itself was big and cooked just right. The meat fell right off the bone. They also had some big chunky cuts of vegetables that I thought went pretty well with the lamb and rice. The next half dozen or so times I've been there the lamb shank has been a hit or miss. Every time I order it, it looks different which is somewhat surprising because it's the same cook every time. The cuts of the vegies are different everytime and how the lamb is cooked is always different. Sometimes it's fall of the bone tender, very moist and juicy and other times its just plain dry. It's a hit or miss. The consistency with the place is just so off. Also, if you listen closely you can distinctly hear the microwave being used a lot for a lot of the orders. That in itself wouldn't warrant a rating of one though.This is why I rate it a one. The last time I went there, there had been a remodeling and me and the gf were eager to revisit. We were told that they were out of lamb shank. I decided to try something new and went with the stuffed cabbage. My order came out and it didn't look that bad. I'm not saying it looked good either but it looked edible. I took one bite and wanted to get up and give the cook a piece of my mind. I thought better of it and took another bite to see if it was just that one bite. It was everything, there was this distinct spoiled taste. It was very sour and acidic, I knew right away that it had gone bad. This is the only time in my life that I've committed the cardinal sin of sending back an order. I've eaten a lot of bad food in my life, from finding hairs in my food, to wrong orders, or just straight up undercooked meat but I've never sent food back ever in my life. This was the only time. The cook came out and tried to tell me that it was lemon juice. Who are you trying to kid here? If the stuffed cabbage is bad, just tell the customers that you're out of it.

The rice was average and yet basically all I could eat because the TK was so damn salty I couldn't taste any of it. Seriously I felt I was doing a great disservice health wise to myself. It was like poison by salt, of which I got a month's worth in one sitting. I ate only the rice and Jerusalem salad, which was actually decent. So I am left hungry and threw the rest out because I felt I was putting horrible quality food full of salt and oil into myself. Ugh.

Our dinner time was around 5PM on a Tuesday and were the only customers, though a man who I believe is the owner was busy peeling some vegetables at a corner table. My friend frequents this location and knew exactly what he wanted to order before our menus were delivered to us. They had a special leg of lamb as well as meat and rice stuffed eggplants. Normally I never order specials, but I was intrigued and the food sounded tasty.Both dishes were huge and meant to be shared. The leg of lamb was gigantic, almost displacing a ton of the tomato broth it came plated with when our server arrived. Flavor-wise it lacked salt, but the meat was fall off the bone tender. Our second dish, the eggplant, looked like two big logs on a plate, in again, a pretty similar broth. Within the eggplant was a meaty rice mixture that was a nice complement to the lamb. After eating all this, I had a crazy craving for some falafel and ordered a plate that came with vegetables, pita, and fried, sliced potatoes. This dish was the real winner of the night. The falafel was crispy and spiced well, and the potatoes were addictive. Overall it was a solid meal, and I found it funny that my favorite dish was the least expensive and had the most flavor.

My friend had recommended I go here and she had gotten a full acrylic nail set the previous day. So I decided to check it out. I came with my friend and sister and when we walked into the place all you could see were tons and tons of working stations and employees. The place looked mildly unsanitary and the receptionist had us take a post-it number. (yes, a post-it). The wait was about a half an hour, but I didn't mind that. The bulk of my negative experience centers around \u00a0the service. When they finally called my number, the nail technician, who might I say was very unfriendly and nonchalant, and for a full acrylic set, only somewhat prepped my nails. . When the lady applied the nail tip, she asked my how long I wanted my nails, and I showed her and informed her that I wanted an almond shape. I even showed a picture for clarification. After she cuts my nails, she switches with a man who is going to do the rest of the job. He is also very stand-offish. After he shaped my nails, he sends me to wash my hands and I see that my nails look HORRIBLE. They are completely crooked, they don't fit my finger shape, the acrylic is super thick, and the nail looks lifted near then end of the fingertip. So I politely tell him that my nails are crooked and I ask him to fix them. Instead of just fixing them and apologizing, because I AM PAYING FOR THIS, he just barely buffs them, and with a condescending tone asks where my mother is - which was extremely rude. So I tell I am paying for this and he needs to fix it. So after my nails are polished thy still look bad. I show my friends and they also agree that they look terrible. So I go to the front and I ask for the manager. Because I'm only 18, they try to brush me off and ignore me by just talking in another language to each other and rolling their eyes. When I repeatedly say I need to speak with the manager, they send the first nail technician instead. At this point I'm so over this place. When the lady comes up she is very condescending, rude, and irritating. When I show her what's wrong with my nails, she starts to blame me, telling me that its my fault my nails look wrong because I chose the length She starts arguing with me, and in my opinion, I should not have to negotiate about something that I'm paying for. If I don't like the product, they need to just fix it and apologize because the customer is always right. She then grabs my fingers and starts filing my nails. Keep in mind, I couldn't get my money back because I had to pay before they were finished. The nail technician only somewhat fixed them. After I left my mom went to the store and told them off for being disrespectful.

There is an extra charge for peppers..REALLY?! On a $10 Combo it should be built into the price. This place is not a shell of what was once a glorious spot. I don't have a problem spending money on a good meal. Don't nickel and dime your customers. Every burger place in the world has gone to value packages. Come on AL, update the menu for a value package. Remember MySpace was once on top, don't be like MySpace.

The Italian beef sandwich I expected to be dripping with juice was very dry - even when dipped. They used to really pile the meat up, but this time I had to open it up to take a picture so you could see what was actually inside. The reason I came was for those famous greasy fries! I remember Al's fries being greasy, soggy, and fresh. I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. When they came out, the fries were way overcooked to the point of crisping and they weren't even warm - suggesting that they weren't fresh. I had noticed prices had gone up since the last time I came as well. My unsatisfying meal cost me $16. The line wasn't too long, but the small restaurant was still a little crowded because of the people standing and eating. Ordering our food was fast and the wait wasn't long either. The man taking our order was neither friendly nor rude, he was simply doing his job. The place was small and kind of shabby - not somewhere I really wanted to be eating inside. If you're going to Al's Beef, you're betting off getting take-out than dining there. Seats are extremely limited. There's a counter where you can stand and eat inside but those are usually taken. There's seating outside you have to rush to, but there are only three tables. There was no place to sit so we ended up walking down the road and asking the burger place if we could sit in their outdoor seating area.

The first time was during the Pay-Per-View Manny Pacquiao fight -- when the bar was absolutely slam packed and movement was barely possible (let alone getting drinks in the desired amount of time). Last night was considerably less crowded, and a more enjoyable atmosphere.However, there were many little things that took place that could have made this experience more than barely adequate. For one, it took at least 10-15 minutes to be greeted by our server after being seated. That was a good indication of the service we'd have the rest of the night. We ordered as soon as she came over. It was $5 martini night so I asked for a manhattan. The server said it wasn't on the menu, but she could probably bring a variation of one (whiskey+grenadine) that used to be on their menu. I said sure. And off she disappeared again. We waited so long for our drinks (something she attributed to the bartenders being busy), one of the other servers checked in to see if we'd been served. The food runner brought us our food a good five minutes before the drinks came out. When does that ever happen??I had the blue collar burger and it was pretty phenomenal. Black angus, pretzel bun... really hit the spot. Just wish I'd been able to get some liquids down before the meal. When the drink did come, it was pretty heavy on the grenadine (looked like a cosmo), but not bad tasting. A second round (ordered as soon as the first came due to speed of service) came out more promptly, but at least a full drink short. After finishing the burger and drinks, we headed to the bar for one more drink. I decided to stick with the manhattan, and ended up wishing I'd never asked for one in the first place. The bartender told me I was \"really making her brush up on her bartending skills\" and that she needed me to remind her of the ingredients. I told her whiskey and sweet vermouth and she made the drink. You probably already guessed -- the drink was completely overpowered by vermouth. She must have poured it 1:1 (or worse). Noticing my reaction to the terrible taste, she asked if it was wrong. I told her there was way too much vermouth - that she should just give it a splash. She tried again but it ended up pretty much the exact same way. At the prompting of the female patron sitting next to me (who had interjected with her own instructions to the bartender about how to make it correctly), she tried a third time. Poison. Again. I really don't know what was going on. She must have had no clue how to pour count. When she rang us up, and struggled to do so -- she told us a now obvious truth; she was new.Either way, I appreciated her efforts to make something off the menu for me, and really didn't want to see all of that whiskey (bourbon actually, as she told me she used Makers Mark) go to waste, so I drank it anyway. By that point, I felt like I had no choice. I was too uncomfortable with the patron next to me instructing her on how to make it (thus complicating this issue further), and generally feeling like I was being an unappreciative pain in the ass. I felt bad - sensing that I had embarrassed and/or frustrated the bartender. But why should I have to feel that way? Why can't Vintage hire qualified bartenders? Or at least bartenders who know how to ask a more knowledgeable bartender (or a smart phone) for the recipe so the onus isn't put on the customer? Lastly, I might not have bothered to post this review if it wasn't for the questionable behavior of one of the bouncers. While we were eating, we sat behind a four-top occupied by employees and their shit (at a time when customers would have definitely benefited from it's availability). On several occasions, we watched this particularly enormous bouncer stand up and throw things at people across the bar. I'm pretty sure they were little pieces of chalkboard chalk. However juvenile this behavior appeared, I assumed he was only doing it to mess with his friends and/or co-workers. But after moving to the bar, I was hit by two thrown pieces of whatever it was he was throwing. I ignored it, not bothering to look at what was thrown and choosing to believe he'd been targeting somebody else. But seriously, bro? The poor service and rude treatment from these employees really killed what was otherwise an enjoyable atmosphere.

Oh the bad \"wings\", service, burgers, fries and tatters! Why oh why???My friend and I walked into this place around 4:30 pm and the place was deserted. I figured it was kind of a weird feeling and sign that no one was around the dine at this time. We wondered how the seating arrangement was at this restaurant as we waited to be given instructions the waitstaff were way to busy looking at their phones, not paying any attention to the real world. My friend and I decided to find our own seat then. Finally, the waitress got off her phone and asked what we wanted. We ordered some BBQ Wings with Blue Cheese dressing, two Blue Collar Burgers, and my friend ordered tatter tots and I ordered steak fries. When the out BBQ Wings came up, the food runner just plotted them on the table without any word. I realized the Blue Cheese was missing...we waited 5 minutes and saw that waitress was too busy talking and laughing and eating while on the job. I decided to go up to her and ask her for Blue Cheese. \u00a0\"Oh, you want like double dressing,\" was what she said when I asked her for dressing. I told her that the Blue Cheese never came. After 2 minutes, she brought the dressing. When I began to eat the wings...it was more like burn buns and dehydrated deep fried chicken meat, what a sad day.We decided to wait for our meal instead of wasting our energy of chewing through such a hard rubber and tough piece of fried me. When the waitress came back I had told her that the chicken wings were inedible and tough, she simply responded, \"oh, what's it tough? I never eat chicken wings.\" Oh, I'm sorry, I hope that she looks up the word in a dictionary to know the word tough'a meaning. The hamburgers were not thrilling, the fries were rubbery and unflavorful and the tots were gosh darn to salty! \u00a0I ordered a medium burger and my friend ordered well-done. The burger I had was well-done as was hers. Oh the torture of not having a good hamburger to your liking!We're certainly no coming back here ever. Cintya P.

Its just a chill bar, but their food is good so I can def see why a lot of our medical community/suits come here for a quick bite and a drink.

I think Khaosan & Taylor took over this place pretty recently.Honestly I wasn't really hungry so I only ordered 1 dish - the Thai Fried Rice with Beef. I liked how it had Kai-Lan (Chinese Kale/Broccoli) in the fried rice. It was decent, although it wasn't exceptional either.My friend ordered the Khao-Moo-Dang (Thai-style BBQ Pork) and told me that the BBQ Pork was pretty good. Although he was a bit disappointed because the menu clearly says that it comes with Hainanese Rice but instead he only got regular white rice. And the rice was kinda cold as well. Another friend ordered the Penang Curry and he seemed to enjoy it.This is not a comprehensive review in any way and I will update it again once I give this place another shot and try their other more authentic/unique dishes. The place has a cute patio with hanging light bulbs and pretty flowers by the windows.I've tried so many Thai Restaurants in Chicago and so I know which ones are good and which ones are okay.

I ate more like thick pieces of cod rather than tilapia. The sauce made with garlic, roasted peppers, red onions and white wine complimented the dish with flavorful bust of citrus. \u00a0The finish it off we (my wife and I) shared the Pasta Aglio e Olio....

I've been to Francesca's at the Promenade and it was subpar although the interior was much more upscale and \"Fancy\" If you will as apposed to this one on Taylor being much more cozy which I'm not such a fan of. I like open space and I don't like touching backs with strangers while I'm eating or being constantly interrupted by finicky children. They should either find a different way to have the floor plan or take out a table or two. I've worked at a Spanish restaurant in the past and no way in hell did our manager let us stand in one corner and do nothing. Well that's what these servers and bussers do. I was there for a good 2 hours the few times I've gone at different times throughout the day/night and it's always the same. I know. It sounds like if I hate this place. But in all honesty I think that if they step their game up here and there they will be an outstanding place to dine at. The food is amazing. Just the atmosphere is a bit of a drag, not a lot of movement. I will say that all the servers I've had, had been nice to me and all had knowledge of the menu and I always like making them choose any plate of their choice and they haven't let me down. They know what people like and they nail it. The Pesto linguini with scallops and shrimp is to die for as well as their risotto which is so rich and savory. Their salads are pretty amazing as well. Their lunch menu is mainly what I go for and I don't remember what I've had in the evenings. But I'm sure it wasn't bad. Everything I've had is great. But like I said.

\u00a0Sure. \u00a0But given the perfect storm that is sometimes Marshalls (particularly after a holiday), can I blame the ladies there for being surly? \u00a0Absolutely not. \u00a0I do need to point out that a bilingual man, who had some semblance of being a store manager, was quite efficient at helping a Spanish speaking family with their purchase. \u00a0Overall: 3 out of 5 (germane to men's clothing)The monetary value of Marshalls can't be beat, but take into account the legwork and physical labor of going through shirts or pants one by one before nonchalantly committing to efficiently and quickly make all of your purchases here. \u00a0Still A-OK, with a few minor caveats.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 12, 28]}, "17": {"description": "The store is very well kept, lots of friendly staff, but this location does not contain as many designers as their downtown's counterparts.

What sets these tacos apart as number one apart from other taco restaurants is how the meat is prepared and served. The meats are well-seasoned, not overpowering or not bland. The meats are chopped coarsely for bigger chunks, locking the juices within the meat as well as preserving the natural chewiness and resiliency you find in each bite of well-grilled meat. Tacos from other restaurants lack this because the meats are chopped finely. I rarely add any salsa onto these tacos because I like them as they are.

They've always been very accommodating.Anyone who bothers to read anything I write knows that I was raised with a grandmother that taught me that garlic is a bulb from the onion family. \u00a0She taught me that it should be used sparingly - as in, heat the olive oil in an iron pan and rub the raw garlic across the oil - then toss out the garlic. \u00a0She also said that tomato paste was an American invention (Ref: Chef Boyardee) and that if you wanted your sauce thick, you cook it all day. You don't add paste as a thickener. Restaurants that add paste are cheating their customers. You also notice that most of those customers end up eating Zantac and Tums as dessert due to the fact that the sauce was undercooked and has about a thousand times more acid than non-paste sauces that are cooked properly.I note these things as a public service and to their credit, Tuscany understands fresh ingredients. \u00a0That said, If you've read other reviews here and the writer raves about the toasted garlic, smashed and served in olive oil, I would suggest that they have (to say the least) an uneducated palate. If you want to eat raw or toasted garlic before your meal, you might as well lick a brine block as you'll actually taste nothing that's served after the fact.Does Tuscany serve garlic as an appetizer? Yes! \u00a0If you don't like it then don't eat it... easy. \u00a0Do they pay attention to detail and help the customer enjoy the experience? Most of the time - yes.The problem is that on our last two visits we've been served portions that are extraordinarily small.We start with the brick oven pizza. It's always good and there's no need to special order anything about it. \u00a0Obviously we need modify the pasta (sans garlic) and do so.The last time we ordered the Penne E Capesante ($22) and this time the Ravioli Della Casa ($18). On both occasions the pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. The serving size was amazing small. In the case of the ravioli, four squares for $18. Why? \u00a0When they place the food in front of you, you stare at it as if it were a joke. \u00a0Four pieces of pasta on this big, white plate!Then I realized - it's the menu! \u00a0There's been a shift in the way they're doing business. Somehow, someone has decided that Northern Italian cuisine has to be \"small plates\" and multiple courses. This is why you only get a few bites in each course and why, not coincidentally, the overall bill is higher than usual.This is not the way it used to be at Tuscany nor is it the way true Italians serve in Northern Italy. \u00a0I know because I have family who own a restaurant in Florence. I've eaten there and you're lucky to walk out with any measure of an \"American\" calorie count. \u00a0As the comedian John Pinette said, \"they kept bringing us food to try. \u00a0After we'd eaten several dishes they said \"okay - now you order!\" \u00a0That's an accurate account of the generous nature of food as a presentation of life. \u00a0Italian food is not tapas and never has been.For many years we've enjoyed Tuscany. Now it's degraded due to economic revisions. \"Oh, they won't notice!\" \u00a0Believe me, we noticed. \u00a0Now off our list of excellent food at a good value.", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 2, 3]}, "18": {"description": "Need to explore this area more!

Two friends of mine from Chicago Lyric Opera were working as singing waiters at the original Stefani's restaurant on Fullerton. I used to show up to sing with them, and I quickly became hooked on the amazing Italian cuisine that this place served up. When they closed several years later, I was heartbroken. I feared I would never taste these dishes again.A couple of years ago, a family member moved to the Taylor Street area, causing me to drop in to Tuscany. O my God, there they were!! The same Stefani family recipes that I had despaired of ever tasting again!When you are first seated, you are presented with a rosted bulb of garlic which the waiter mixes tableside with oil and a bit of salt, to be eaten with a basket of warm breads. For me, that garlic spread and a martini would be enough!One thing you should know is that the menu contains many delightful dishes, but you needn't confine yourself. You will not see many classic Italian staples on the menu. That is because the kitchen will prepare any classic dish if you simply ask.My favorite appetizer is large, tender, alabaster-white grilled calamari, served over arugula salad. It's been off the menu for months now, but I ask and they make it. Last night, I tried a special appetizer of prosciutto, a white creamy cheese, and fig jam, served with pizzettas (little warm, airy popovers). Amazing!The two entrees I had dreamed abut since Stefani's closed were veal marsala and linguini with white clam sauce. They were both exactly as I remembered them! The veal scaloppini was tender and flavorful, topped in a savory marsala sauce with dozens of little button mushrooms. It comes with a side of rotini in a tasty red sauce. The linguine features tender clams in the shell. I think what I like most about this dish is that is rather dry - not at all oily or saucy. Flavors are robust. My wife is partial to the veal chop, which is pounded thin to a size that overlaps the plate, and covered with gorgonzola.The restaurant is conveniently located about 3 blocks west of the Taylor Street exit on the Ryan. The valet is only $6, and they park the car in a small lot right beside the restaurant, so you never have to wonder what became of your car. This is a popular spot for sports fans, so it can be crowded in the early evening before games at the United Center or the UIC. The room is open and attractive, but it can be very noisy when there is a crowd. Bartenders and waitstaff are colorful characters, but very professional and efficient.A tip: Some Costco stores in the Chicago area sell gift cards to all Phil Stefani restaurants. $100 in gift cards for $80. I pick these up when I'm anticipating a trip there.Another tip: Tuscany has another location in Oakbrook. I've been there twice and I don't hate it, but it's not the same.

I called a few weeks ago and asked if they took reservations for large groups, to which they said yes but suggested we go with a pre-set menu for our group of 12. I worried that this might not sit well with the rest of my group, since it was also a set price, and that the quality of the food might be jeopardized, but I could not have been more wrong. BEST suggestion ever. And here's why: 1)We went with their cheapest per person menu and were given SO much food, even the guys in our group were happily stuffed by the end of the meal. 2) The food was ready as soon as we sat down at our table. I'm not kidding--as soon as we sat down, they brought out the appetizers. And each course after that was ready to go as soon as we were ready for it, too.3) EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. From the starters to the dessert, everything was absolutely incredible. We started with bruschetta, which was made with seasonal vegetables instead of your generic tomato mix, and it was so good. We also had the mason jar of ricotta with honey--YUM. \u00a0For the second course, I chose the prosciutto pizza and it was absolutely lovely. And for our entrees, I chose the spaghetti carbonara, rigatoni wth Italian sausage, and pork shoulder polenta. OMG THE PORK SHOULDER POLENTA!!! I will remember it forever. And last but not least, a plate of their reputable Blondie bars--to die for. 4) From our wonderful waitress, to the very nice and considerate gentlemen who helped her, and last but not least Dina, everyone who worked with us at Davanti Enoteca was kind and so considerate. After sitting and enjoying our meal for 2.5 hours (maybe more), Dina came over and asked if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. She felt SO bad about having to move us (there were other people waiting for our table) that she sent us off with a free bottle of wine.

When we got there, parking seemed to be way easier and generally the area wasn't as busy, which was good. Atmosphere: This place had a real rustic feel to it. It seemed cozier than some of the trendier Italian spots in the city and had kind of a wooden decor theme going on. I liked it. \u00a0Food: I've never been to any of their locations before, so I just let her take the lead on the ordering.Polenta / ragu of the day - This dish was pretty cool because they assemble it in front of you at the table. Our server brought out a wooden board and then spread the polenta on it. Then he layered the ragu on top of it. The ragu of the day when we went was veal meatball. I thought it was pretty good. The polenta added a nice creamy texture and served as good base for each bite. The ragu had plenty of meat but I couldn't really taste a huge difference with veal meatballs over regular beef ones. I heard the pork shoulder ragu was even better. Crispy pork belly - Basically massive strips of gourmet bacon. These were thick cut and had an awesome crispy outside. Every bite started with a nice crunch and then you just hit a layer of melt in your mouth fattiness. I just wished it was a bigger serving. I could've eaten plates and plates of that stuff. Uni pasta - Apparently this is main reason she even chose this place for dinner...it's pretty much her go to dish. I was a little skeptical since I'm honestly not even a huge fan of seafood to begin with but damn it was pretty delicious. It's actually a really simple dish. It just looked like a plate of noodles at first, but once I took a bite I was surprised at the flavors that jumped out at me. The noodles were very al dente and from a texture standpoint it wasn't very saucy at all. But that sea urchin sauce that cooked into the noodles was both rich and bold, without having an overwhelming fishy taste. I'd definitely order this again. Overall, I enjoyed the dinner at Davanti.

A shared order of pasta with sausage that was also flavorful. Also a side of corn with mushrooms, which I thought the corn on its own would be better, and I like mushrooms.

The first uncomfortable thing that should be noted is the small pathway near the bar. The tables are too close to the bar and it gets even more packed with everyone just standing around. My sister, her gf and I finally saw an open spot at the bar; there were two empty seats. The bartender, Jose, came up to my sister and her gf and said that the seats were taken. My sister said okay, that's fine. So they got off the seats and just stood up while looking at the menu. About 2 minutes later, the bartender comes up to them again and says, \"There are people sitting there already.\" My sister told him we'd all move out of the way once they got back to their seats (whoever they were, they never came back). Jose comes back a third time, looking ready to take our order. My sister lets out about two words before he says \"Oh I'm leaving right now. I'm off the clock.\"So he tells the other bartender to take our order. Jose then stays at the bar for another hour or so, taking other people's drink orders. So rude, and so unprofessional! Despite the shitty service, the drinks weren't good either. I ordered a Pineapple Express, and I didn't drink it. It was ridiculously sweet. So I gave it to my sister in law and she managed to drink 1/4 of it. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, and it was disgusting. Again, too sweet. It was not refreshing at all. A friend nearby came over to the bar and told us her Mojito was too strong. These bartenders need to get it together. The only good thing about Bar Louie is their music, the DJ was great.

We were seated immediately at the bar and asked asked for our order. The bartender was very courteous and prompt in taking our orders. I had the Effin' Good, my friend had the S'mores martini along with the spinach and artichoke dip. My drink was refreshing with a kick, and her drink tasted like a dessert, which I really liked. \u00a0The food was very forgettable, and overpriced for the portion it had. The service, however was very sporadic. The bartender checked on us once maybe after our food arrived, and took a while to get our check. Which is fine. It was a busy night. On this experience alone, I would've given this a 4 stars. Second visit: I went there today with another friend for their Happy Hour and Tuesday Burger special. Everything was good as usual. The server seated us promptly, the waitress, Liz, introduced herself and told her The Diva was her favorite martini. She came back maybe after 10 minutes to get our order. I had the mango martini (90 miles to FL), and my friend had the Diva. Both drinks were delicious. For the burger, I ordered the Blue Louie, and my friend the Fried Louie. Liz double-checked to see if I got the Blue Louie. Food came, and I had the \"Louie\" with giardiniera, not \"Blue Louie\" blue cheese and bacon. It looked good, and I didn't wanna send food back, so I happily ate my burger without any complaints. Giardiniera is not the best topping for the burger I learned, as it overpowers the whole flavor of the patty. So I'll avoid that when I come here. In the middle of my meal, I spill my drink while trying to grab my napkin (talk about greasy food and glasses not mixing), and was trying to clean it up when Liz comes. I told her I had a little accident with my drink, and she flat out, with a straight face, asks me: \"Are you drunk?\" That ticked me off a bit more than it should've. I could understand if she was joking, but she wasn't laughing, and neither was I. I said no, very politely. I mean I'm sure she dealt with accidents, and the table next to mine had 4 rounds of martinis while I was still on one cocktail. But she walks away, and that's that.And that just left a sour note on my whole evening here.

My fiance and I were welcomed and told to sit anywhere, and chose a couple of spots at the bar. It was pretty empty around quarter to 5, but we were very happy to discover Happy Hour is weekdays from 4-7, with some great deals: $3.25 for a 14oz draft, $4 wine, and $5.25 signature martinis, plus several 1/2 price appetizers including flatbreads, calamari, spinach dip, and wings. They have a decent draft list with a few craft options; hubs had a Matilda this evening. I like ciders, but your choices here are Woodchuck and Angry Orchard, nothing special, so I went with a S'mores martini for the extra $2. The martini tasted just like a dessert and even had mini marshmallows; I enjoyed it. We also split the spinach and artichoke dip served with crunchy tortilla chips; it was tasty enough for us to eat it all. With the HH pricing, our 2 drinks and app came to less than $15; it's hard to beat that deal in Chicago, and that's worth a 4th star. Outside of HH prices, I can't say I'd be drawn here for the regular burger/bar food or drinks specifically and it would probably be 3-star, but 3 hours a day, 5 days a week Happy Hour is a pretty big range to grab an affordable snack and a few drinks.

All in all, I have mixed feelings. It is a new addition to University Village and has replaced Maxwell's.First visit: \u00a0I went there last Friday to grab a drink with a friend. We were seated immediately at the bar and asked asked for our order. The bartender was very courteous and prompt in taking our orders. I had the Effin' Good, my friend had the S'mores martini along with the spinach and artichoke dip. My drink was refreshing with a kick, and her drink tasted like a dessert, which I really liked. \u00a0The food was very forgettable, and overpriced for the portion it had. The service, however was very sporadic. The bartender checked on us once maybe after our food arrived, and took a while to get our check. Which is fine. It was a busy night. On this experience alone, I would've given this a 4 stars. Second visit: I went there today with another friend for their Happy Hour and Tuesday Burger special. Everything was good as usual. The server seated us promptly, the waitress, Liz, introduced herself and told her The Diva was her favorite martini. She came back maybe after 10 minutes to get our order. I had the mango martini (90 miles to FL), and my friend had the Diva. Both drinks were delicious. For the burger, I ordered the Blue Louie, and my friend the Fried Louie. Liz double-checked to see if I got the Blue Louie. Food came, and I had the \"Louie\" with giardiniera, not \"Blue Louie\" blue cheese and bacon. It looked good, and I didn't wanna send food back, so I happily ate my burger without any complaints. Giardiniera is not the best topping for the burger I learned, as it overpowers the whole flavor of the patty. So I'll avoid that when I come here. In the middle of my meal, I spill my drink while trying to grab my napkin (talk about greasy food and glasses not mixing), and was trying to clean it up when Liz comes. I told her I had a little accident with my drink, and she flat out, with a straight face, asks me: \"Are you drunk?\" That ticked me off a bit more than it should've. I could understand if she was joking, but she wasn't laughing, and neither was I. I said no, very politely. I mean I'm sure she dealt with accidents, and the table next to mine had 4 rounds of martinis while I was still on one cocktail. But she walks away, and that's that.And that just left a sour note on my whole evening here.

This was my first time at any Bar Louie, and when this one opened up in University Village, I was initially excited to try it! My friend and I went for happy hour ($5 burgers on Tuesdays and $5 martinis every day from 4-7 pm!). Upon walking in, we were greeted with enthusiasm from a group of hostesses. The restaurant itself was moderately busy. Liz promptly sat us at a high top table by the front doors...little did we know she would be the problem. After briefly looking over a menu that reminded me of a glorified TGI Fridays, my friend and I ordered martinis (Diva, as per Liz's suggestion, and 90 miles to Florida). Both were delicious! However, the table was so small that I spilled some of my martini by accident, but my poor friend spilled almost half of hers. Upon encouraging her to request a new one and motioning to Liz, we explained the situation (and ended up ONLY asked for napkins). The idiot had the audacity to ask us, \"So...Are you guys drunk?\" Not jokingly either. Serious. With a look of disdain. We stared back at her dumbfounded. HOW. DARE. SHE? We were not falling over or sloppy in the least bit. We had ordered ONE DRINK. WE WERE NOT DRUNK. Never before have I encountered such rude service.We ordered the Blue Louie and the Fried Louie. (Saint Liz messed up our order and gave her the Louie instead, after asking her explicitly if she wanted the Blue Louie. Smart girl, right? HA!) The Fried Louie was absolutely delicious: bacon, cheddar cheese, and fried egg perfection. The meat patty was well-done, but not charred. For anyone who dislikes onion on their burger, this one doesn't come with any! I was so pleased.When we asked for separate checks, I wanted to pay with cash and Liz oddly waited as I counted it and obviously eyed me for a decent tip. I tipped a standard 20% because I'm not inhuman, but I was less than impressed with the service.

Our food arrived within 15 minutes (we barely noticed the time as we were having good conversation). I got the BLTT sandwich and he got the Southwest Burger, both were very tasty and served as we ordered. After we received our food, Malessa gave us some time to eat and checked in on us 3 times afterwards between checking out. Never had an empty glass of water and was pleased with the service.

The Strawberry Bellini seemed to be a hit amongst the sweet tooth's out there.Food wise- the bruschetta was definitely high up on the list. Laid out on some large, fancy cocktail glasses, you get plenty of fresh tomatoes and lettuce to top off your garlic bread. The buffalo wings here were decent as well.

Yep, that is what you will hear from Mr. Rubi calling out to summon customers to Rubi's at the market while simultaneously sharpening the knives to cut the al pastor meat to perfection. And that is the same thing I left thinking when I finished my early lunch at Rubi's this past Sunday.Open from 7am-3pm every Sunday, Rubi's has some of the tastiest tacos and quesadillas I have ever tasted. I am really picky when it comes to Mexican food and even my mom that is an amazing cook was impressed. Where to begin?There is a vast selection of taco and quesadilla choices; certainly goes beyond your usual al pastor and steak. Options include mushroom, huitlacoche (corn fungus), rajas (sliced grilled jalapenos), mole and many many more. All are served in a big, fresh and tasty homemade tortilla that is made right before your eyes. I opted for a carne asada taco with cactus and a quesadilla con rajas (grilled peppers). Both were topped with onion and cilantro and with the green and red salsa on the tables, I was in heaven.The tacos and quesadilla were not greasy, huge portions, and tasted extremely fresh. I loved that the tacos were topped off with a grilled cebollitas. I cannot wait to go back and try the al pastor, and the tacos with huitlacoche, as well as the mole rojo taco. You can only eat so many tacos - believe me, picking out what to order was the hardest decision I made all day.I also noticed that this was one of the cleanest places to eat at the entire market. I also liked that unlike some of the other stands, they have one person that focuses specifically on taking your order and handling the money. I really appreciate that they have hand sanitizer available too & the utensils and napkins were well-stocked.The woman working there (maybe she was Rubi herself?) told my mom that when they don't sell out (which is rare) they eat the food themselves or give it away; never freezing it using it the next week. We believe her - everything was so fresh and tasty. No mysterious vats of ingredients; you can see everything being made and grilled right in front of you.Rubi's has just vaulted up to my #1 favorite taco place in the city and is the sole reason I will be making the trek out to Maxwell Street Market (well them and for the churros). Maybe it is not so bad that they do not have a restaurant and we have to wait to partake in deliciousness only once a week on Sundays at the New Maxwell Street Market, otherwise I'm thinking my waistline would be vastly expanded.Do yourself a favor and head to Rubi's on Sundays - but get there early, they close at 3PM but often sell out before that!", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 8, 8]}, "53": {"description": "The listing is incorrect on Yelp.

In fact, I've actually followed this Sunday market as it's been displaced by the city to three different locations over the years. The original location was located actually on Maxwell Street and Halsted. Starting around the 1880's, Eastern Europeans became the dominant ethnicity in the hood here. During this same time the open-air pushcart market appeared, which eventually made this neighborhood famous for deals, shopping & goods from around the world. Over this long history the neighborhood has changed along with the different ethnicities that have called it home but one thing remained. This market was a place where everyone in the city could come together and shop. There were no ethnic lines or judgements. Everyone was bonded by one common goal...to get a good deal. When I was a little a trip to this iconic street was not complete without a visit to Jim's for a Maxwell Street polish. I believe this is the birth place of the Chicago style polish. As you walked up to Maxwell Street, all you could smell were onions grilling. In fact, if I close my eyes I can still smell them now. Yum!I was really mad at the University of Illinois at Chicago for stepping in and ruining this Chicago tradition. In 1994 they slapped an eminent domaine on Maxwell Street Market, in order to take there property for themselves. Some things were not meant to be torn down and thanks to UiC we lost a piece of Chicago tradition because of greed. Luckily the city recognized the rich tradition the market played in our history and relocated it a few blocks east to Canal Street. It was also renamed the \"New Maxwell Street Market\". Unfortunately the market was no longer in Maxwell Street. Also the delicious smell of Jim's onions were also forced to move. Thanks UIC...NOT...as I'm shaking my head. Jim's Maxwell Street Polish is actually closer to his original location then the market is. He was moved over to Roosevelt Rd and the frontage road of the expressway. There's nothing like a polish with onions over there. A visit to Jim's reminds me of being a child visiting the original Maxwell Street on a Sunday. The new location was okay but lacked any feel of tradition that the old Maxwell Street contained. Then in 2008, Maxwell was forced to relocate again to Des Plaines Avenue. I blame Dominick's for this. They complained that the Sunday market was ruining there business. Let's recap...Dominick's said it was ruining there business...where is Dominick's now? Gone! If anything ruined Dominick's it was Safeway. Again another Chicago tradition that will be gone forever. RIP Dominick's. My point is we need to stop messing with a Chicago tradition or it will just disappear. I hope that this will be the final home for the famous open air market. The city has even erected medal structures on each corner to signify the markets existence. The market has changed over time but you never know what you are going to find. Also come hungry because the Jim's Polish dogs have been replaced with steak tacos. Yeah there is still the smell of onions in the air but its a different smell. Shopping and food go hand in hand. My brother taught me a valuable lesson about Maxwell street. Get there as it opens, in fact, if the vendors are still setting up their tables that's even better. They are eager to make their first sale, so you have the negotiating power to getting a good deal. Also, don't take the first price. You are suppose to haggle that's how people shopped before price tags. I also want to share a piece of market etiquette that you should use while shopping. Please do not walk up in the middle of my price negotiation with a vendor and then try to out bid me. This is not an auction. I was here first...walk away and find your own deal. This is the most annoying thing ever. It happens more when it's crowded and is really uncool. So have some respect to the process and negotiate your own deal. Maxwell Street has been around for a long time. It is part of our history and I hope it has a long run at the new location. Everyone loves a market. I am glad that Chicago has a place where all ethnicities can join together in a common bond of shopping for great deals.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 30]}, "26": {"description": "Wow!!

My personal favourite and I could seriously eat 1,000 of these are the Oaxacan tamales. These tamales are huuuugge! Don't confuse these with your average tamales. These Oaxacan tamales are wrapped in banana leafs and filled with salsa verde, chicken and cheese. These tamales are \u00a0soft, buttery, and rich in flavor. These bad boys can feed two people for the price of three bucks. Then there is Rubi's, which is everybody's favorite. They are good and well worth the wait. Remember to get the grilled onions. Then there are several stands that sell goat tacos,soup and tortas. YUMMMM!! Goat can taste quite gamey. However, if cooked right, it will leave you wanting more.

I didn't do A-B comparisons on those items though the same day. \u00a0I also believe it does *not* apply to any non-refrigerated food items, but that's just my impression. \u00a0But I do believe that grape juice that is in the aisles has the same price at all the Costco stores in the area.I know this does not affect the price of things like electronics since for one they frequently publish those prices in their coupon books.One further location detail, if I recall correctly the north side location also had lower pricing! \u00a0And that north side location has no Sam's Club near it, so not sure what's up there. \u00a0If anything you would think the north side location would have the high prices since it's in a much better area.So again I want to repeat that it's no fault of anyone who works here, and I've had very positive experiences at this location as far as customer service, but I think Costco should change their policy about this kind of pricing. \u00a0A Costco should be a Costco and that means being able to rely on pricing. \u00a0And I shouldn't have to investigate and compare prices with another Costco that is 5 miles away. \u00a0And also I'd like to know exactly how extensive these price differences store to store are.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 11, 10]}, "54": {"description": "I was the last hold out in my family to join Costco. \u00a0That was until I learned there was one near the South Loop with a gas station!!! \u00a0Awesome location, staff are both helpful and friendly. \u00a0After a recent purchase at Costco Optical for a second pair of glasses, I couldn't be happier. \u00a0They are actually better than the ones I purchased at a nearby vision center for a fraction of the price.

If you're a first-timer, here's how it works: Manny's is really 3 restaurants in one plus a bakery, set up cafeteria style. First, stop on your way in to read the sign showing the day's specials, then pick up tray and utensils and join the line. The first station is a steam table with entrees and sides. Beyond that is the deli--so if you're hankering for a foot-tall sandwich, skip the front and move half-way down to the deli station. Your sandwich will be hand made, and adorned with pickle or potato pancake if you wish. In between, you can pick up soup--from matzoh ball (highly recommended) to borscht (ditto) to navy bean, they are all delicious. Beyond the deli is the never busy salad section (too healthy for most), where someone will make your salad, or you can pick up sides like cole slaw or bean salad. Want a scoop of chopped liver (and who doesn't?), get it here. At the very end of the line, beverages, and after the 90 degree left turn, desserts. Don't reach for your wallet now--the mock cashier will give you a check, but you don't pay until you are ready to leave, in front. There you will find packaged baked goods to take home and continue noshing. Got all that? What could be simpler. The food can be pretty good. To eat well, order smart.

First, stop on your way in to read the sign showing the day's specials, then pick up tray and utensils and join the line. The first station is a steam table with entrees and sides. Beyond that is the deli--so if you're hankering for a foot-tall sandwich, skip the front and move half-way down to the deli station. Your sandwich will be hand made, and adorned with pickle or potato pancake if you wish. In between, you can pick up soup--from matzoh ball (highly recommended) to borscht (ditto) to navy bean, they are all delicious. Beyond the deli is the never busy salad section (too healthy for most), where someone will make your salad, or you can pick up sides like cole slaw or bean salad. Want a scoop of chopped liver (and who doesn't?), get it here. At the very end of the line, beverages, and after the 90 degree left turn, desserts. Don't reach for your wallet now--the mock cashier will give you a check, but you don't pay until you are ready to leave, in front.

He attentively made 6 keys for me which I came home to test. The price was also very reasonable - cheaper than Home Depot. Because of my Home Depot experiences, I expected some to not work - what a relief that 100% of my keys worked flawlessly! Maybe even better than the mediocre key they were made from! Wow. I've got more keys to make (my partner habitually loses keys - arg!) and I'm definitely coming back to Chiarugi to get them made. While waiting for the keys, I browsed around. Everything was very neat. Turns out they have wine and beer making equipment so if I ever take the plunge to brew my own beer, I'll be coming to Paul to get started with expert guidance.

I passed this place on Saturday, on my way to pick up art supplies. I'm a bit overdue to update my prescription as I never seem to find the time. I had a bit of time, so I figured I would pop in and see if they accepted walk-ins. They did, and they had frames I liked, so I agreed to wait until the doctor was finished with the previous appointment. I went into the waiting area, which is really more of a hallway with some chairs. It was a bit dingy and uncomfortable, and there were some rambunctious teenagers sitting right next to me, so I was eager to walk back to the main area to turn in my preliminary forms. The retail clerk ordered me to sit back in the waiting room and that someone would collect my forms, so I did. I had a woman take me for the two preliminary exams. I made a bit of a joke, which she promptly ignored. She then informed me she would be giving me a glaucoma test. I didn't want the puffs in my eyes, and I told her that I thought I had opted out (there were a number of tests to opt out of). She told me, \"You CAN'T opt out of it.\" I explained that, if that was the case, that I didn't want the test, since I didn't want any tests that would put anything into my eyes. So, she wrote a note on her sheet, and made me sign that I was opting out. Then, Dr. Patel saw me. I found her to not only be standoffish, but downright rude. First, she tested my peripheral vision. She took off my glasses and told me to look at her nose and not her fingers, as she ran her fingers in front of my eyes from side to side. I've worn glasses for over thirty years, and my vision is terrible, so unfortunately, her nose was quite blurry. No matter how hard I tried, I would accidentally focus on her fingers, since it was the most prominent object in front of me. Every time, she'd snap, \"look at my nose and not my fingers.\" I attempted, in a humorous and light-hearted way, to explain that I was doing my best, but that her fingers were \"a rapidly moving object in a sea of blurriness.\" She decided not to test my peripheral vision after that. She did a variety of tests with the machine, asking me to pick which lens was better. She went very quickly and so I had to keep asking her to show me the lenses again. She seemed very annoyed and impatient, but while she would agree to show them to me, at no point did she take the hint and slow down the pacing. Afterwards, she pointed out that I had declined the glaucoma test. When I explained I didn't want it that day, she gave me a long speech about it, saying, \"you're in your forties now, you aren't in your twenties anymore\" in a rather chastising tone more suitable to an older relative than a professional. \u00a0(This was especially odd coming from someone who looked and behaved as if she had only been out of school for a few years herself.) However, at no point, did she provide me with any factual information whatsoever, but rather just preached a bit. When I went home, I was curious, so I looked up information online and found that 40 is the age after which you become at risk. I just turned 40 this year. Had she provided even that much information, she would have been considerably more persuasive. After reprimanding me for not taking the test, she made me sign in two additional places (besides the one place I had already signed with the previous woman). I then selected my glasses. The retail sales clerk looked at the glasses I had chosen and then said, \"I see you've chosen these frames. I know you want to be fashionable, but your vision is really bad, may I suggest these instead?\" and pulled out a pair of wire frames. I dislike wire frames and the frames I picked are actually quite similar to the frames I have now. My husband and I both tried to explain that to him. He kept trying to sell me on the wire frames until I had to very firmly explain that the frames I picked are the frames I wanted to buy.Today, I went to pick up my frames. Aesthetically, they looked just fine, but when I put them on, I instantly became aware that they were the wrong prescription. I compared them to my other frames several times to make sure it wasn't just an issue of adjusting to a new prescription. I then noticed a sign hanging from the store ceiling, so I read it with both glasses. I could actually read the sign better with my old prescription! So, I insisted that I get my money back, under their 30-day money-back guarantee. First, I was told that I had to wait for the manager to get back from lunch.

I currently go to UIC and I've never really been to many of the restaurant in the Maxwell Market, there is a variety of places to go in the area this possible seemed like the most breakfast place to go. They have really strict hours only open from 7-3 you have free parking for 2 1/2 if you can find a park. Let's get to the actual restaurant... The staff was very friendly and attentive, they have someone walking around with water for anyone who's cup is low which is really good because most places you go you have to ask for more water. This place is great for a fast breakfast it's no fine dining but they definitely put care and pride into the food they put out on your plate. I didn't really care for the style of the menu the different names they had for omelettes was really cute. This place has a rustic cultural community feel to it draws to a variety of consumers. It was actually quite busy when we went but we did not have to wait to be seated the food came out pretty fast. I got the COCO which was like a chocolate bacon Belgium waffle and it came with two sauces a raspberry(didn't like) and an amazing vanilla sauce topped with more bacon chocolate chips and whip cream. If you use the sauce they give you, you don't even need syrup it is a very sweet breakfast however it is very light. The waffle was light and fluffy not heavy or oily like any other breakfast places I've been to. My boyfriend got sweet potato and signature hash browns turkey sausage and over medium eggs nothing a breakfast spot should mess up. I was underwhelmed by the sweet potato hash brows they didn't taste great but mixed with the classic ones they were a good pairing.

As many parties waited for a table outside, we observed at least 3 tables waiting to be cleaned up. It took at least another 10 minutes for a table to be cleaned. When we were finally seated, about 30 min later, our table was very wet, DISGUSTING!!!!! The busboy wiped our table with a sopping wet towel and it would not dry. I had to take our napkins and wipe the table. THE FOOD: Our server came 5 minutes later and took our order. My husband ordered a burger and asked to substitute the sweet potato fries with sweet potato Hashbrowns. I ordered pancakes and coffee. Our waiter said he would be \"right back\" with our coffee. He apparently forgot so I had to flag down a busboy convince a busboy to bring me coffee 15 minutes after our order was taken. Another server brought our food and my husband pointed out that his fries were not substituted with sweet potato Hashbrowns. Instead offering to bring us Hashbrowns as he ordered, she told him \"try the fries anyway, they are good.\" I asked her to let our server know and he did bring us a bowl of mushy, cold, Hashbrowns. My order was equally disappointing. My chocolate chip pancakes were dry and only had chocolate chips in the very center of the pancake. Your server never comes back to check on you after your food is served. THE CHECK: When I could not stand another bite, I had to flag down our server for a box and the check. It took another 10 minutes for him to return with this. On the way out, I observed many parties waiting to sit down. If this place was more efficiently run, there wouldn't be such long delays.

The face was on fire a bit and I like to pride myself as someone that can handle a decent amount of heat. The garlic parmesan barely tasted like garlic or parmesan.

I thought that was silly; the wings would get cold! It was snowing out too so that wouldn't help. My order came and I told the waitress \"hey I don't want my wings to get cold, just confirm my order is correct\" so she did and off I go. When I get home, I noticed I was missing 10 out of 40 wings. I called immediately, spoke to a manager whose immediate reaction was so backwards, I was in disbelief. Here's how the conversation went down:Manager: \"Did our staff show you your order so you knew it was correct?\"Me: \"No, I didn't want my food to get cold.\"Manager: \"Well that's why we ask them to do that, so these kinds of situations won't happen.\"Me: \"............. are you kidding?

She dismissed me again, saying I could come right away to pick up the missing wings but I wasn't going out in the wet, snowy conditions after getting home already. I asked for an IOU like most places would do. She said they don't do that but she could send me a gift certificate for the amount of food I was missing (10 wings). I agreed, gave her my information.

The boneless wing itself was fine. Nothing spectacular but definitely met expectations. The sauces though ... wtf? The medium sauce was definitely at least a hot on every other wing scale I've had. It had a good taste but was way hotter than advertised. I normally get \"hot\" other places but went for medium to please the hubs who I was sharing with. The face was on fire a bit and I like to pride myself as someone that can handle a decent amount of heat. The garlic parmesan barely tasted like garlic or parmesan. What it tasted like was butter and TONS \u00a0of oregano. Why so much oregano? In general the flavors were just confusing. I do not get it.Mini corn dogs were just ok but the order literally had 10 tiny little corn dogs in it. It was served in a basket that dwarfed the serving size and just made it look even more depressing. To be fair, the dipping sauce was super good. Not your typical honey mustard that you'd expect but very good. Fries. Meh. Boring. The cheese sauce was pretty good but it also was not as advertised. It was more of a chili cheese sauce than anything. It was decent actually but also pretty confusing.

I personally really like the curry, parmesan garlic, and buffalo. 4 stars for food because they are tasty and not too pricey.One star for poor service. I've dined in before and gotten take out as well. My one dine-in experience, our waitress disappeared for over 30 minutes. We postulated that she went on break with no one to cover her. Poor management of the staff.On to my take-out experience. Waiting for my food, I noticed that they would open each and every box of wings to show the customers the order. I thought that was silly; the wings would get cold! It was snowing out too so that wouldn't help. My order came and I told the waitress \"hey I don't want my wings to get cold, just confirm my order is correct\" so she did and off I go. When I get home, I noticed I was missing 10 out of 40 wings. I called immediately, spoke to a manager whose immediate reaction was so backwards, I was in disbelief. Here's how the conversation went down:Manager: \"Did our staff show you your order so you knew it was correct?\"Me: \"No, I didn't want my food to get cold.\"Manager: \"Well that's why we ask them to do that, so these kinds of situations won't happen.\"Me: \"............. are you kidding? The problem is that your kitchen and staff didn't get the order right.\"She said she understood but then made a snide remark about how it still saves everyone the hassle of an angry call like this. What in the world... WHOOSH, completely missed my point. It is NOT my responsibility to make sure the restaurant I am paying money to for food is doing THEIR job. She dismissed me again, saying I could come right away to pick up the missing wings but I wasn't going out in the wet, snowy conditions after getting home already. I asked for an IOU like most places would do. She said they don't do that but she could send me a gift certificate for the amount of food I was missing (10 wings). I agreed, gave her my information. She said it would take about 2 weeks to process and get it out to me. It's been a month now.

Another 15 minutes go by, and we finally get greeted (hi, what you want) and put in our drink orders.

After waiting all this time, it shocked us when our food came out in mere minutes and was piping hot. The person bringing the food sat it down and immediately walked away without asking if we needed anything. We both ordered chicken type dishes and with one bite, it was clear that our food had been microwaved based on the rubbery chicken, unnaturally hot food, and the quickness that the food came out. I eat Asian food multiple times per week, and this was clearly not fresh in any way and impossible to cook these dishes that fast. One of the dishes had an odd taste so my wife had literally one bite and stopped eating. The chicken in my meal was so rubbery that I decided to just pick through the noodles because I was quite hungry at this point. Twenty or so minutes past and someone walks over, sees that my wife is clearly not eating, and takes her plate. How do you see a plate of food that hasn't been touched and not ask if something was wrong? These people clearly do not care.

Most of it would be Chinese American, but if you're feeling Thai, Viet, or Singaporean, there is likely to be some rendition of their national dish here for you to eat. However, with so many options, you know Joy Yee probably won't be specializing in anything particularly amazing.First experience, I ordered some brisket noodle soup for lunch. The brisket was awfully chewy, hard, and overall not good. The soup came with thick rice noodles instead of thin egg noodles, which was disappointing. Plus a lack of vegetables in the soup made it nearly inedible.Second time, I just got a $4.50 boba, a strawberry-mint concoction. Given it was a hot day and it's large portion, I was extremely satisfied with the drink. Chock full of sugar, yes. But it was still a treat and decent quality boba in the UIC area.Third time, I was craving for some calamari so I ordered their Thai Fried rendition off the seafood menu. At $15, it was rather steep, but the take out included a very large helping of squid. However, it was pretty bland, with little to no real salt-pepper seasoning that I expected. I also ordered a small Wonton Chicken Soup, which I have to say was probably the best thing I've gotten from Joy Yee.So I've had some terrible experiences, and some decent ones.

I don't get to frequent it much since I'm currently in school in Southwest Michigan, but I thoroughly enjoy it when I do get the chance. I particularly enjoy their large menu, but the best part of the Joy Yee's experience has to be their bubble tea!Atmosphere & Comfort:Probably the biggest knock about this place is the atmosphere. Although plenty spacious, the restaurant is often crowded and loud. Moreover, their chairs are terribly uncomfortable. They're literally pieces of scrap metal from the junkyard welded together in vague resemblance of a chair. What makes it even worse is that it's sometimes cold inside the restaurant so I can imagine how cold the chairs must be to the skin. Overall, not the most comfortable spot to eat at.Food:My personal favorite is the Beef Cubes! Perfectly sized cubes of cooked steak over delicious tomato rice in a HUGE bowl! A very rich, savory, and filling meal much thanks to the incredible portion size. I'm craving some now just writing about it haha.Bubble Tea:My two favorite are the Mango Lychee and Thai Iced Tea. When it comes to fruit smoothie bubble tea, this place is the best I've ever had! The fruit is always fresh and the boba doesn't taste funky or old like some other places might serve them. Super refreshing and a great if you just want to pop in to grab a bubble tea!Service:The service here isn't spectacular. I've had some so-so experiences where the waitress was rude, but with a lot of Asian workers, it's not about being the most polite--it's about getting the job done and they definitely meet my expectations when it comes to timeliness and attention. That isn't to say that they are outright terrible, they just do their job.Overall:In retrospect, I almost always leave Joy Yee's with a good to great restaurant experience.

Most of it would be Chinese American, but if you're feeling Thai, Viet, or Singaporean, there is likely to be some rendition of their national dish here for you to eat. However, with so many options, you know Joy Yee probably won't be specializing in anything particularly amazing.First experience, I ordered some brisket noodle soup for lunch. The brisket was awfully chewy, hard, and overall not good. The soup came with thick rice noodles instead of thin egg noodles, which was disappointing. Plus a lack of vegetables in the soup made it nearly inedible.Second time, I just got a $4.50 boba, a strawberry-mint concoction. Given it was a hot day and it's large portion, I was extremely satisfied with the drink. Chock full of sugar, yes. But it was still a treat and decent quality boba in the UIC area.Third time, I was craving for some calamari so I ordered their Thai Fried rendition off the seafood menu. At $15, it was rather steep, but the take out included a very large helping of squid. However, it was pretty bland, with little to no real salt-pepper seasoning that I expected. I also ordered a small Wonton Chicken Soup, which I have to say was probably the best thing I've gotten from Joy Yee.So I've had some terrible experiences, and some decent ones. Overall, I think my love for Asian food helped push Joy Yee over to the 3 star side, but rest assure, a lot of their food is pretty unimaginative and lacks flavor.

However, another suggestion of mine is the Pork and Sugar Cane Shrimp. It comes with noodles, pork, sauce, and a shrimp patty skewered by a real sugar cane. The shrimp is P-A-C-K-E-D with flavor, and the whole symphony of flavors come together when you pour the sauce over it.Also, if you came and didn't get the bubble tea (or any other kind of specialty drink), I'm sorry, but turn around and go back because you didn't actually get a Joy Yee's experience.

I recently moved back to Chicago after having (among other things) spent the past four years in Milwaukee for graduate school. After settling in, I decided to check this one out. I was really impressed by the selection. At the store in Milwaukee, I typically had to shop at two different places for my puppetry supplies and my painting supplies. I'd go to Michael's for puppetry stuff and Utrecht for my painting supplies. Not only could I get both at this particular Michael's store, but I was able to find puppet supplies that I couldn't find at the Michael's back in Milwaukee. I actually was so amazed by the selection that I spent a lot more than I originally intended. In terms of staff, they seemed fine to me. Pleasant, but no hard hustle and not overbearingly social. At the same time, when I checked out, the cashier was friendly and amiable. Honestly, when you're shopping somewhere that pays maybe $8/hr with (I'm assuming) no chance for commission, that's probably the most you should be expecting. As far as the parking goes, it is a little bit of a maze, but since Michael's is part of a rather extensive shopping plaza, that's probably more the fault of the people who designed the plaza than the people that run Michael's (who likely have no say over it).

They had nice invitation kits, but nothing to my liking. The kits ranged from too busy to too cheestastic.

I had hoped for something a little better. The scrapbooking aisle seemed like the biggest in the store laid out in the middle. I checked out the rubber stamps in hopes of finding a cute one for the escort cards. I managed to find something handmade/knitting related, but otherwise the selection was okay.

Much of what's on the menu appears to be adapted to the American palate, and particularly that of the young college student variety. There is lots of sugar, in everything. The first time I went, I ordered the samgyupsal bokkeum dosirak. It was not what I was used to. It was ruined by the sugary gochujang-based sauce which drowned the flavors of the kimchi and the pork belly. There was so much sloppy sauce on the plate that you could slurp it. Today I ordered kimchi jigae, figuring it was safe. Like the bokkeum, it was sugary sweet. I tasted no garlic, no dashida, and no kimchi. It tasted like the cook just chopped up some raw napa and threw it into the soup. It didn't taste like any jigae I've ever had in my life (and I'm in my 40s). My friend ordered Jap Chae and it was fine. The banchan has been so-so. I will still give it another try.

The color selection of nailpolishes was excellent, and then the tools they used were impeccably clean: sterile packed tools that are opened fresh for each client. I would say it is always important though to express the types of things you want/don't want in your manicure: nail cutting or filing only, what shape, and any other issues you have with your nails. I did not say anything and one of the cuticles was cut off to far and the nailpolish painting job was only average - there were sides of the nails missing polish and that was annoying because that is the final and most important part of the whole experience.

Pro: 1. The nail tech (her name was Ivana) was really nice2. They take walk-in, which is really convenient. 3. The monthly specials are great deals.Cons. 1. There was no soaking prior to trimming. I've never had a $35 manicure with no soaking. It was just straight up filing, cutting the cuticles (read more below), roughing up nail plates, polishing, and a 10 sec lotion massage.2. Two of my fingers bled during cuticle trimming. The nail tech said it's because my cuticles are too dry and \"very long\". You can see from the picture that there was a cut wound beyond my cuticle. She put anti-septic on the wounds, but she keeps rubbing against the wound with her fingers like she wants to smear them off. I am really worried about getting infections.3. Granted i have short nails, so it's probably difficult to do a great manicure job. However, when the manicure session was done, I saw that the gel nail polish doesn't cover all the way to several nail tips. The nail tech said this is due to the shrinking of gel polish, and because my nails are short so there's not too much nail for the polish to \"grab on\". However, I've never experienced this before when I got gel polish in other places. The nail tech tried to fix the nail tip for me, and I really appreciated her effort, but the end result is a nail with super-thick top coat overflowing to the flesh area. 4. One thing I cannot stand is that when there is excess polish getting beyond the nail boundary due to over-painting, the nail tech keeps using a USED wooden stick/pick to scrap it off. I can tell the wooden stick has been used because it already has nail polish stains (same color as the nail tech's polish), probably from scraping off excess polish from her own fingers. All the other nail places I've been to use acetone/polish remover on a cotton ball to remove the excessive polish.

I've been frequenting more often due to the uptick in friends tying the knot. I've been in for a rental and a custom suit on two occasions. There might be validated parking but I resorted to the meters in front of the store. Usually no problem getting a spot. Hard to estimate how long you'll actually be in the store. They have helpful associates, some of which are very new, and a couple others there are there to get the new location up and running. They have a ton of formal threads in stock in addition to casual attire.Never seems to fail that rental suits don't fit quite right. They are actually pretty horrible fitting to begin with (e.g. very wide pant legs). I had to come in, try on the suit, and ultimately get a size adjustment to come pick up later. The original measurements were right but whatever they shipped to the store was very far off. If they could just get it right the first time I would be impressed.The custom suit was tailored to my needs. If it's not in stock, they order, and you come in for a fitting. Measurements taken, they tailor the garments in-house, and you arrive for pick-up. I have to say the price for the tailoring was pretty decent at $47 to alter the pants and jacket. Not bad. When I picked up post-alterations it was fine but the waist was a bit snug even after letting it out and the legs were too long. I brought them back in and they made adjustments free of charge.This location is pretty nice and a good location if you live near the Loop. A Nordstrom Rack just opened up next door too.

I had such an easy-breezy experience here and I am excited to share how happy it made me to rent my fiance's tuxes for our wedding here. We are new to Chicago, but are familiar enough with the area, and since this store was open the latest, we decided it was our best bet to make an appointment at this location due to their later hours.Immediately, we were greeted by Rohan (I really hope that's how you spell it - sorry if it's not!). He recognized that he had an appointment and greeted us and got right to business and asked us both what we wanted (so as not to assume that my fiance wasn't really in charge - haha). This made me feel very comfortable and respected. Once I told him that I was actually going to be the final decision-maker, he asked me what I wanted to see and he knew EXACTLY what I was asking to see. You know how difficult it is when you're planning a wedding to describe something to someone and get exactly what you described? Next to impossible. I was so grateful to have someone working with us who knew exactly what we wanted.These types of processes can be overwhelming, but Rohan made us feel like we were on top of things and we had it together - it made me feel like wedding planning was a breeze. I'm not joking here - what I anticipated would be a difficult process was the easiest (and one of the most fun) aspect of wedding planning. We enjoyed our time and we also (this is important) greatly appreciated not being taken advantage of with our price point. Rohan didn't show us things that were outrageous and not possible for us. My point here is that the customer service was at the supreme level of paying attention and not making assumptions.

I live in the medical district \u00a0and I usually order food three times a week from Taj Mahal. The first time I was there the interior design was very beautiful, it had lot of Indian artifact and paintings. Although I wasn't good at ordering Indian food the staff was kind enough to help me with my order. I ordered a medium heat butter chicken with butter naan, Vegetarian Samosa, and a Vegetable Biryani.  The food was very good. The butter chicken was finger-licking good, It had a mild heat and it was full of flavor that complements the chicken, the sauce was perfect creamy, the consistency was not too thick or too thin and it was perfectly salted. The Vegetable Biryani was colorful dish with an amazing cocked vegetable aroma and the rice was perfect not too soft or hard, it was delicious. The butter naan was good with a strong butter flavor, however, I didn't like the Vegetarian Samosa, it had a very weak taste of potato with no salt, it was like tasteless mush. Although the food was good the prices were a bit high for the portions that they gave. For our meal we paid about 40 dealers. \u00a0Unfortunately the past week or so the quality of Taj Mahal food and serves was drastically decreased due to the management and staff change. The last time I was in there, I barely recognize the restaurant. The restaurant had a new look, the entire artifacts and the paintings were removed, it looked like a cheap restaurant not like the Family restaurant Taj Mahal That I knew, and maybe they didn't finish their design when I was there but it looked way worse than before We waited for our order about thirty minutes, and when they eventually came they gave us the wrong order, and they insisted that our butter chicken that we ordered was actually Lamb Curry, after a long argument, we had to wait another thirty minutes so they can figure out what went wrong.When they gave us the correct order we were very disappointed with the quality of food that they gave. The food was cold, the chicken was dry and the souse was week and full of oil. However, the manger apologizes for their mistake and they explained that the staff was new and with fifty present off from our order we forgave them.I really hope that Taj Mahal will get better, and get his old glory back.

The fact that he even had a space heater immediately available indicates that it is cold in there all the time. The space heater measured the inside temperature of the restaurant as being 50 degrees! When it's freezing cold in Chicago, as it was yesterday, you don't want to freeze inside as well!

We ordered a dal, which was a mushy tasteless glop of stuff. We also ordered a spinach mushroom masala thing, which actually had a fairly nice taste to it, but was so spicy I couldn't eat it at all (we did ask for mild, so either the waiter forgot to tell the cook, or else that WAS mild for their palate).

Plus there are some other great restaurants in this area now (literally go across the street, great BBQ food).Getting back to food and drinks, both are delicious. I really like the margarita's here and they have Milagro tequila, which is a favorite for me. Their mojitos are just as good and perfect on a Summer day/night The fajitas are a good size portion and juicy meats plus some great veggies. I am never disappointed with a selection here. They also have catering and I have used this numerous times (birthday parties, family events, large party) and again never been disappointed. Any and all guests rave about the food and love love love the salsa. I usually have either just the right amount of food or a small amount of left overs, in which everyone wants to take some home. :) Overall, double check the night you go for what is going on and plan accordingly.

Well okay, there was an incident on that Friday I went that disrupted my dinner time at Lalo's. It seems like there's a lot of large group parties at Lalo's (bachelorette, birthdays, etc). As the mariachi band was playing, there was a lady who was \"turnt up\" was yelling, shrieking, dancing, and screaming of joy and fun the ENTIRE time. I thought I was in a jungle. I don't usually converse with other customers at a restaurant but the tables around us all felt the same way and was just shocked at the annoying noise produced by this woman.

I told him if he had mentioned that at the beginning when I made the reservation I would have understood And NOT waited for that long but neither the hostess ever mentioned that to me at all!

I had two of the strawberry lavender lemonade (spiked with vodka), which was really refreshing and tasted dangerously absent of alcohol. The best part, though, was that Three Aces was playing a DVD of the best of WWF wrestling; we were in the midst of 1993-1994 while I was there, and the group next to us also enjoyed cheering for The Macho Man, (SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM, O YEAA), catching a glimpse of the late Owen Hart (RIP!), and admiring the many fantastical mullets of early 90's pro wrestling; (Best:see Shawn Michaels).

It's rock and roll, meets metal, meets foodie heaven. We were seated promptly at the bar and were lucky to have come in when we did because the joint quickly started to fill up at about 7. Our server, albeit very hip and dressed in all black like Johnny Cash, was very friendly and eager to help us. Drinks were first, as always...me, A Little Crazy (Revolution)..and the beau, a classic old fashioned. The beer list is quite robust and actually has, on average, three beers each from many local (and surrounding state) breweries. Getting back to my beer... my bf said he didn't need to order 'a little crazy' because he gets that everyday with me. *sigh*not funny*Anyhoo on to the food. We ordered the special of the night, which was a house made sausage pizza with giardiniera, mozz and sauce. I was a little skeptical because I'm not the biggest giard fan...but being the good gf I am, I said let's order it because the beau is nuts over the stuff. Well, I'm sure glad we went with it because it was bomb! The sausage was awesome and you could tell definitely homemade. We also ordered the chicken thigh sausage which was served on a bed of polenta and other fanciness. This was equally as good! The polenta was so creamy and a good nod to farina back in the day...I may be dating myself here but it really brought me back.In short, Three Aces offers a solid, quality product from their food and drinks to their cool ambiance.

It is hard to evaluate a bar on their specialty drinks when the bar is hopping; just order some simple stuff and move quickly. The outdoor patio was crowded but much quieter. We settled on a bench watching drunk people play a very good game of bocce and chatted about our evening before heading out.Three Aces fits the bill as a nice watering hole with plenty of good people and cold drinks.

As usual when everything looks good and I get nervously indecisive, my fiance and I opted to order one sweet and one savory breakfast and share. I hemmed and hawed over whether to order the mixed berry crepes or the butter pecan waffles, but decided on the crepe, you know, to be \"healthy.\" By crepe, they meant three crepes stuffed with and topped with strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, with a raspberry and cream coulis and whipped cream. No skimping on any ingredients here! Once I thought I had decided, I pulled out my phone to check in on Yelp, and was delighted to find a check-in would get you a free order of mini-waffles, and yes, these mini-waffles COULD be butter pecan. You can have it ALL at Stax! The waffles were hot, fluffy, crisp, sweet, and had whole pecans IN and ON the waffles, lots of waffle-y goodness, with whipped cream. My fiance went with the tender beef brisket hash with potatoes and an egg, which also came with mini pancakes. Well seasoned, well cooked. SO MUCH FOOD! Add a hot chocolate with whipped cream and a coffee and we still hadn't even spent $30. Our server was also great \u00a0- Merissa, genuine smile, appeared to offer a coffee refill without being flagged down and to check in at the right times, efficient; joked about my whipped cream overdosing, definitely the person you want to deal with before 9 a.m. \u00a0We packed up at least half of our meal to go and got Sunday breakfast out of it too, supplemented with an egg or two of our own.

After calling several places for delivery only to find out they were all open but no longer delivering, my boyfriend found this place online. We called to ask if they would deliver to our hotel and the man on the phone nicely said he would check and call us back, which he did, and said that they do not normally service our hotel a couple miles away by Michigan Ave, but they would still come anyways. Awesome! We ended up ordering the B(e)LT Meal with fries, the small order of buffalo wings, and some customized fries (philly cheesesteak, Nacho cheese chili , and bacon). After completing our order, we were told that they usually do cash only but they accepted our card over the phone because we were a little short on physical money (who carries that now a days anyways?) lol. We were so happy that we found this place. The service was so awesome from being so patient and making an exception for two hungry visitors from California. The man was very nice to us over the phone so I thank him for extreme great customer service.wait time for delivery was 40 minutes. When we received our food it was actually past closing time, at 2:15am. Once again I thank this place for servicing us even though it was actually past their operating hours. Moving on to the FOOD the bacon egg lettuce tomato was hearty and they did not skimp on the bacon or give us a puny egg. It was packed, although on mine it didn't include any actual lettuce. They might have left it out to make sure it didn't wilt from the heat in the box though, no biggie. The fries- I was a little disappointed because they were a bit soggy, but once again, there was so much condensation in the box from enclosing a freshly cooked food item it was understandable. However, I think everyone should request crispy fries, just in case. The buffalo wings were yummy with delicious tasty sauce and ranch on the side. We didn't know if they were boneless or not, but that was our fault we didn't clarify that they were not boneless. The customized fries were very good, tasteful meat and a good amount of toppings. The bacon is REAL and not McDonald's fake so that's awesome. Once again fries could have been way crispier. Overall we were very pleased with this place for going out of the way for us! Be made clear, this is in no way a 5 star restaurant, it is a pub, and it serves yummy late night finger licking good food for people who are either drunk or late night munchers like we are.

Volcano attracted my friends and I on the way to Ichiban because it looked like another standard AYCE joint on Taylor. After walking in and getting seated, we realized that this is essentially Ichiban 2.0, but without the claim to being \"number one.\"Volcano was definitely a... dare I say it, even more basic version of Ichiban. At a $15 AYCE price for lunch, I shouldn't expect top quality sushi. However, there were some things that made me really unsettling while eating here:1. Service was hella slow. We were the only group inside and we had to wait a good while for our food to come out. Towards the end, when we all paid for our checks, we waited nearly 10+ minutes for the server to bring back our tabs.2. The food here was not even up to par with Ichiban. The rice was hard and it made it a complete chore to finish. My Ichiban roll's piece of tempura was terrible. Stale, limp, and NOT what you'd want out of fried seafood. I wasn't even able to finish all the rice from my sad nigiri. I also tried my friend's yakiudon, and it did not have that stir-fried taste that tells you it was made with care.3. My friend and I both agreed that we kept getting stares from the sushi chefs as we were eating. I'm not sure why, but every time I turned my head towards the direction of the chefs, they would give us these cold stares which made me feel uncomfortable eating. I felt like we were being judged, especially when I wasn't putting the entire piece in my mouth and scrapping for the ingredients. Seriously, the rice was not good here, and that's nearly half of the piece of sushi.I won't give this place just 1-star because some of the appetizers were decent, the fish quality wasn't terrible, and they didn't charge us extra even when some of us had extra food lying around. However, unless they kick it up by a few notches, I definitely don't think this is worth it.

Because of the 'Great Recession' I have been using box products. I get it - it is not ideal. Because of my inexperience my hair kept getting darker and darker brown, which is not flattering to my light complexion. I decided to go to Paul Mitchell for two reasons: 1. Price and 2. a professional consultations.The woman assigned to me a, a Phase II student, didn't have great listening skills and didn't seem to have a passion for hair at all. I was told Phase II students have tested in and been accepted by Paul Mitchell. I was very disappointed. My goal was to lighten my overall look. Daisy suggested highlights. We looked at light blonde/brown and red and Daisy had no firm recommendation either way. I went with red thinking the look would be more subtle.The price factor: the advertised price was $32.00, I walked out paying $98.00. Guess what? Highlights are extra and I needed 3 extra bowls of color, which I signed off for each time. Since my lawyer wasn't with me, I just took the plunge and initialed and signed. My hair is cut in a bob - just one inch below my ear, it does not hang to my waist, FYI. I can just imagine how many bowls of color people with waist length hair require. When the instructor asked how I liked my color, I explained it was too dark and the highlights looked like red stripes on my head. My hair is the darkest its ever been. My friends are teasingly calling me \"Morticia\".The instructor asked how I would like to fix it? \"highlights? an over all color?\" I explained, again, I don't know their business. I was looking for a consultation and a recommendation. I was looking to lighten the look - not darken it. The school did offer to do a color correction for free.

I really don't consider this a school because I get better quality service here than I do at normal hair places. I have been coming here more than a year and never had bad hair cuts. They have two phases. Phase II students are picked by careful selection and audition whereas as any student can give you a haircut in Phase I. Phase II services are more expensive. Normally I use Phase II but recently, I tried Phase I for the first time.It is as good as- maybe even better than Phase II. I have to share my positive experience. I went in for a shampoo and blow dry. The Phase I student hair stylist was confident and tackled my really long hair without any complaints. I have hair until my mid back and other hair salons (not Paul Mitchell) usually make comments on how hard it will be or how long it will take. I don't need to hear comments such as that especially because I usually end up tipping them double the cost of the blow dry service. However, the student stylist at Paul Mitchell never complained and did my hair by herself. It was only when I nicely told her I was in a hurry that she asked one of the other girls to help her. Even by herself, the student assigned to me was very quick and would have finished my hair in less time than I normally spend at Phase II. She did an awesome job- even added curls with the blow dryer to the ends of my hair. I also noticed that she didn't skimp on the products she put in my hair. My blow dried hair stayed beautiful for 4 days. Later on I found out that she was a novice but honestly if she hadn't told me that, I would have gone on thinking that she was close to graduation (she was that good!). Bottom Line: Try out Paul Mitchell. Based on my recent experience at Paul Mitchell, I feel that Phase I and Phase II students are equally as good but Phase I might be a little better because it is cheaper. The students really listen to your requests and do their absolute best to follow through. They all have an instructor with whom they discuss the plan of action as well as an evaluation when the hair service is finished. At the end of the day, both Phases have a great knowledge of hair and each phase have students with varying degrees of experiences doing hair. \u00a0TIP: Everyone must try Paul Mitchell for cheap but 5 star salon worthy hair services.

I signed up to take the 3 day mens course at their academy. the cost is $860.00. I signed up months before the class, went to the school the week before to clarify and ask questions about the tools needed. got all ready and excited. I came prepared and ready to boost my hair skills.okay, heres what happened!I followed the instructions very specifically arriving to the school 30 minutes early. but when I got to the school the door was locked. I was baffled why the door would be locked when people are expected to show up. I noticed only by observing from affare a side door, apparently they have a side door for professionals, so I went in by following another attendee. the second and third day, they kept the professional entrance locked and both times I had to knock hard for their assistants to hear me and let me in. I found it \"not smart\" to ask people to attend and keep the door locked on the attendants. well that was a small issue.During the morning of the 1st day of this hair class, I got a bad impression. I did not personally like the teachers' manner and style of teaching but I took that as a personal opinion and decided whether or not I like him personally does not reflect his knowledge, ability to teach or the content and value of the class. so my gut was telling me something was up, but I made excuse's to myself because I really wanted to like this class.one of the major parts of hair classes and this class is doing technical practice on mannequin heads. during the same morning the teacher asked the assistants to find the male mannequin heads. they looked in boxes and all around. then we went to break. well it turns out, I know this from over hearing the teacher in the hall yell at his assistant and question on of the co workers, the school did not order or have mannequin heads for the class. this is a major aspect of the class the school was supposed to provide for and the completely flopped on it. the first day we used women heads, the 2nd and 3rd day we head male heads.another feature of the class was supposed to be working on models. I was promised by an email from a representative for the advance academy that I would do at least one model, one real person to do hair on and I did. one of their students. infact, the whole class got hair school students for the models, which really means no people from outside came in and they rushed to the class rooms and grabbed all the males they could find to provide us. the teacher expected us to work on models the next day but on the 3rd day during the morning he announced we wouldn't be working on models because no one came in.thats the whole point of my dissatisfaction. they had months to prepare for the class, just as I did preparing. I checked my tool list a week before the class. they never checked if they had the mannequin heads, they didn't even know until the actual class. and they had weeks to book men to come in for that monday and tuesday, to get a free cut by licensed professionals polishing their skills. but with all those weeks and day, they never booked models for the class. and how could they possibly believe that by chance over 11 or 12 men would randomly walk in, exactly ar 10:00am on the monday and tuesday and magically by chance, the models would provide themselves? thats impossible to assume. you need to book people to ensure there men for the hair class! how else and where else will they come from!?!? and I can make this criticism because I have taken courses at other academies and other hair academies manage to prebook all their models for every day of their course for every student. every student is ensured they will work on a model and the school gets peoples names down who agree to come in at their appointed time for their free haircut. so its not impossible, other schools are doing it, why cant Paul Mitchell???and in my personal opinion and professional one as a working hairdresser, the content of the course was hair school basics. I already work on mens hair. this is an advance course to up-notch my skills, not give me basic skills like im a newbie.compared to other hair courses I have taken on cutting mens hair, this did not match the quality and professionalism other academies are preforming at.

However, my last visit was very unfortunate. I had not cut my hair in two years, it's pretty damn long. All I wanted was layers (I even showed some pictures) I thought it would be pretty simple... THINK AGAIN...THREE hours later, all that basically happened to my hair was an inch cut from the bottom. I left with absolutely NO layers at all. I felt really stupid afterward when I attended a party and was literally told, \" your hair is so long girl, time for a cut!\" This was not even an hour after I left Paul Mitchell. I'm giving one star because I expect more from this school. These instructors are teaching their students how to style and cut hair for a powerful name. If these student graduate without being able to cut layers, that scares me for the future of the industry.

The first time was a few years ago. I got a few highlights. My hair looked okay. I decided to go back this month to get my hair lightened and trimmed. I figured that these students are watched very closely so there is no way they could ruin your hair too badly... LOL.Before I went to this salon I had long, beautiful hair. Everyone would compliment me and people thought I had hair extensions because my hair was so long and beautiful. My hair fell down to my butt cheeks. Took me several years to get it that way. For some reason I felt really adventurous and decided it would be cool to lighten my hair. When I went in I asked if it would be possible to lighten my hair and if it would be extremely damaging. The stylists told me I would need to get a couple inches trimmed off after the lightening process but that I would still have incredibly long hair, so I went for it.The first session I had a few weeks ago went so poorly that they ended up giving me a free redo session and they overcharged me. My bill was $178 total. I was in shock. They billed me for ELEVEN bowls of extra color even though I only signed off on six... each extra bowl costs $8 on top of the base fee of $32. AND my hair was yellow because they took so long doing a 'double process' (a process the students wanted to try because they had never tried it on a human head before...honestly, who would say that to a customer?) that the salon closed before the toner could sit on my head long enough. My hair was yellow. The next day I complained and they gave me my next service complimentary. I should have cancelled my appointment or demanded my money back but I went in again. Before they started the color they offered a complimentary hair cut because they did not do this last time even though I was billed for it. The learning leader advised me to cut about 3-4 inches from the bottom to get rid of any damage. I agreed. My hair was so long that 3-4 inches really was nothing. I would have still had waist length hair. The learning leader advised the student whose name was Moriah to do the cut and left. Well, Moriah must be really bad at math because she ended up cutting TWELVE INCHES off. I didn't realize what was happening until she swung my chair around and started on the front. I was in shock. I had heard of stories like this where you go in for a trim and they cut a ton off... but a whole FOOT of hair? Moriah stopped in the middle of my cut and ran off and then her learning leader came over and told me she had gotten ill and had to be sent home. Someone else took over, did a terrible job finishing the hack job and I left.I seriously cried for hours when I got home. My hair now barely falls past my shoulders. That still sounds long, but it used to be down to my ass. And the haircut they gave me is terrible. They cut straight across... no face framing, layers. My hair is one length and falls very awkwardly. I had to fix a few strands once I got home. There where random pieces that were two inches longer than the rest. Just awful. I need to go somewhere else now and get a real hair cut, which means my hair will have to be even shorter. Do not go here. Really terrible and the prices that are listed are base prices. You will end up paying almost $200 for some shit student to chop your hair off. :( The students who did my hair (there were at least 3 working on me) seemed really nice, but then after the first 30 minutes started to talk crap about everyone in the salon including other clients... as they were doing my hair. So professional.OOPS! I forgot one more detail, the cherry on top: not only did I leave here crying, but I also left looking like a total idiot because they did not wash or wipe all of the dye they got on my face off.

On a whim this past Saturday I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. When you walk in the place is very clean and there is a great vibe. The front desk staff could not have been better; offering me water, letting me know where the restroom is locating and offering me a magazine to read while I waited. Kelly gets an A+ for professionalism and kindness. I wish I remember the woman's name at the front desk as she was also kind and and professional. The front desk staff gets 5 stars.

While I was under the dryer she just stood there looking at me, which was a bit nerve racking.Once the Keriplex treatment was complete and I was back for another wash, same experience as the first.I explained to her what I was looking for, a trim (no more than 1/4 of an inch) for my layers and my bangs. I also asked for my part to be down the middle. After two attempts I had to part my own hair as she was not able to determine where the middle of my head is. While this was going on the leader/teacher stood and watched me part my own hair.Nearly 2 hours later she was still attempting to cut my hair. Once the cut was completed she would take a section of hair and apply 5 products then attempt to use a round brush to complete the blowout. I know that she used mousse but not clear what else she was putting on my hair.When I reached the 3 hour and 15 minute point, I flat out told her to just rough dry my hair, cut my bangs and get me out of there. She continued to take a section, apply way too much product and attempt to dry my hair. A second time I asked her to just stop what she is doing as I do not need my hair dried. Keep in mind my hair is chin length - not long by any means. At this point she told me that I need to realize she is not a professional, only a student. Yes, I realize this, but it seemed as if she never held a dryer, brush or pair of scissors in her hand prior to this encounter.Eventually the leader/teacher looked at my hair, and the student explained that I needed to leave. I asked again to have my bangs trimmed as they still were not done. At least three times I was told by the leader/teacher she would get to my \"fringe\" in a moment. All in all the haircut was just okay, I am finding uneven layers, but my bangs, aka \"fringe\" are way too short. I did tip the student because I felt bad for her, she was obviously in over her head (no pun intended). When I was checking out and was asked about the experience I was honest and they did not charge me for the haircut, which was a nice gesture.Would I go back, not certain.

From start to finish, I would say I spent about 3 to 3 1/2 hours at the school for updo and makeup, and was charged $37, minus tip. Can't beat that bargain!

I would never recommend this place to anyone to receive services or someone looking to become a successful hair stylist! Not only do they get over on the guest that come to receive services based on the prices that they hike up and give the most incompetent students there the most technical tasks that they know these students are not prepared to execute on a guest. But the sad part is how they treat the students there I read all these post and 75% negative. Please understand it is not the students fault but the schools, who policy is to put a student on the salon floor taking guest after only being in a class setting for 8 weeks learning the basics. And yes there are learning leaders on the floor to assist a student that needs help but how much help can they be when it is 12+ to one learning leader. someone suffers and unfortunately it is the guest that is there giving their time and money for a service to be completed in a timely manner that they will be satisfied with. And the students who's spirits have been broken because they know they have did a effed up job! But Paul Mitchell the School Chicago benefits because they are still paid at the end of the day. That is there main focus make money no matter what! Give u an example they have this educational experience called \"CAPER\" that they hype up dedicate a full school day to pump up this event that takes place in Vegas. Now to qualify to go to caper you have to sell 45 \u00a0\"product bags\" \u00a0that start at 29.95 and go all the way up to 160.00! someone sold 40 bags and jus couldn't get those last 5 off and one of their fellow classmates were willing to give them the five bags they had sold so that at least one of them could experience \"CAPER\" the school said no. Now how fair it that basically Paul Mitchell just pocketed over $1000 from product sales and neither one of the students benefit anything. They have absolutely horrid policy's that makes it much harder on the student to complete their education properly. If you're late to class by one minute you must clock out and go home for the day. How fair is that to the people that travel hours just to make it to school and have to turn back around and go home. its just not a good choice and I hope this will help you make a decision if your are interested in coming to Paul Mitchell the School for services or school", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 1, 15]}, "14": {"description": "I gave this place 2 shots and needless to say, I'll never be back.Both times were for color. I have grays that need covering, the ONLY reason I dye my hair. I stress that every time I sit in a stylist's chair. For some reason, none of the students can grasp how to cover grays on a brunette's head. Both times, I left with an OK color, but you can still see my grays (they're more highlighted - happened both times). Not only that, but my hair is SO dry from having dye in it for nearly 2 hours, I'm forced to see my real stylist for a $60 cut. The time it takes to get your hair done is seriously not worth saving the extra $35 you'd have to pay to get it done by professionals - especially when the finished product isn't the best. I expected a little more from the Paul Mitchell School, but you live and you learn. They are students, which I understand, but they shouldn't have free range to ruin your hair.

I only ever get on my yelp soapbox where I feel I would be able to help others avoid a truly horrific experience.That is exactly what I have just had.We placed an order with De Pasada (through Grubhub) at around 7:30 this evening. All seemed well, we received our order confirmations and Grubhub app was tracking our order. All was well and we were expecting our food by 8:30 - 8:40 pm, per our updated tracking information.Come 8:57pm, we decide to give Grubhub a call; they're always really helpful. Grubhub calls the restaurant, and texts us back that they spoke with the restaurant and De Pasada promises our order would be delivered by 9:06pm; a total of 96 minutes after our order was placed. Fine. At 9:17pm, our food still had not arrived. Again, we call Grubhub who then calls the restaurant. Grubhub calls us back to let us know that De Pasada would be giving us a call to give us a discount and (presumably) to apologize for our food disappearance. We get the call from the restaurant who asks us what was wrong with our order. You know, the order we still had not received. Anyway, after letting them know we still had not received our food, De Pasada tells us that they will have to call us back.It is now, 9:55pm, no food. We did get a call back from De Pasada. They made sure to tell us that their cooks remember making the food. The driver remembers taking our food somewhere. But the manager doesn't know where our food went. No apologies. No discounts. No offers of remaking our food on the house. No nothing.Save yourself. No one deserves to starve.Plus, let's all face it, their food is mediocre at best.
