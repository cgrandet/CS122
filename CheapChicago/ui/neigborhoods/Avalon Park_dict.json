Each and every occasion I would plunk down my money for overpriced flowers for just about every occasion. In all fairness, many of the arrangements were beautiful and the delivery most of the time was when requested (I can think of only one instance out of many orders when delivery was not made). \u00a0I can not think of many times when I did not spend under $200.00 several times a year on different occasions. At any rate, I'd been telling all my friends and family to take their business there . . . that is until now.My daughter asked me to place a Mother's Day order for sunflowers as a special tribute to her mother, my wife, from her and her two siblings. My immediate thought was to place the order through Flowers Unlimited. She suggested that I place an order on line. I over-ruled her and went to the store in person to place the order. I placed three different orders, one of which was the sunflowers for my wife, the others to my mother-in-law and a special order from me of roses. They assured me that they would be delivered as requested, the arrangements I chose and on time (the day before Mother's Day). The children were excited and expecting their mother to get real enjoyment out of this arrangement. But, on Saturday morning I got a call on my cell from Flowers Unlimited at which time they informed me that they could not fill my order because they didn't actually have any sunflowers. I asked why they waited until the day before to let me know, and especially since I placed the order over a week prior. They had no answer or logical response.I drove to the store, expecting to either be reimbursed for the full charge of the sunflowers, or given some discount or consideration on another arrangement. Instead, they were less than apologetic and were seemingly reluctant to even provide me a refund. I decided to consider a different arrangement since time was running out and I saw another type that might be nice. The price they quoted (a half dozen roses) was even more expensive than the sunflowers. When I balked, they simply maintained they would remain at that price without any other consideration. I told them to process the refund.Meanwhile, my daughter who still wanted to try and buy the sunflowers for her mother, placed an order online. This order was as much as 20% more than the one I placed with Flowers Unlimited in person, but we just wanted to be sure we were able to get them. My daughter placed the on-line order and called the number offered, spoke with a representative - TWICE - who assured her that sunflowers were available from the store that they work with and that they would be delivered - same day.Well, they were delivered after a few hours. But the order delivered were NOT sunflowers. The delivering store: Flowers Unlimited. When I pointed this out to the delivery person they told me to call the store and speak to \"Tony\". Apparently they close down their \"customer service\" on certain days because the call was taken by a call-taker not at the store. I explained my problem to this individual who said no one could be contacted - at 4:00 pm on a Saturday - and I would have to wait until Sunday - Mother's Day. They claimed that it was essentially my fault because they didn't have any sunflowers and they substituted what they had, yet I PAID a premium price for an article I never received - even though I was assured - both in person and on the telephone. What's more, I paid more for a delivery I should have gotten in the first place at a much cheaper price.These people simply don't have a clue. It would make sense to check your inventory before you tell a customer that you have an item in stock. As soon as you discover a shortage, it should be incumbent upon the business to contact the customer so other arrangements could be made. The same goes for telephone/online transactions. In both cases it's like it was a \"bait and switch.\" I would never do business with these people again. Even their attitude toward the customer was essentially \"take it or leave it.\" There was no indication or concern about how this might affect the plans of the customers or the person for whom the flowers were intended. I'd rather go to the local Jewel's or some other established florist instead of these folks.Business people should be truthful with the customer - anything less is a business killer. Trust is an essential when it comes to something like this. I will now be about the business of warning my friends and family to NOT do business here again.

The people who run it are nice but this is about their business.I have only been to Glo On Braids twice and unfortunately I won't be returning because they are getting too expensive. Don't get me wrong, they do a good job on the hair but I am not made of money and at some point you have to question what you are really getting for your money. The first time I went the cost for mid back Senegalese twists was $200 in September or October of 2013. The cost for the same hair-do in February 2014 is $250 which is now really out of my price range. I understand that prices have to increase for inflation but a $50 increase is ridiculous. Now I don't have a lot of experience with getting my hair braided/twisted \u00a0and so I went with Glo On because they had really good reviews. Everyone seems to have an opinion of what makes a hair braider good and all I knew was that this place had good reviews and they weren't too difficult to get to. Something else that bugged me besides the price was willing to write off is the experience. When you have someone sitting in a chair for up to 6 hours and the client is paying you a lot of money I think it is courteous to offer them refreshments such as water and it also can't hurt to apologize if you are delayed by something.The last time I went I think that my spot was overbooked because at one point there were 3 people at once waiting to have there hair done including myself (though she did have an assistant). At some times I was left sitting waiting for long periods of time because she was working on other people. Shavon started doing my hair at 9:30 but I didn't get out of her office until 6pm. It is in the south loop off of Wabash and Roosevelt Road.I don't have a lot of experience with hair braiders so I thought I had found a winner that I would return to for years to come.

So when I decided it was time to get some new ink in this area, I asked some good friends where they acquired their fantastic ink. \"Deluxe Tattoo\" they said, and pointed me in the direction of the great Ben Wahhh. Ben was great to work with, from start to finish. Actually, I can't say that, because we're not finished, but... from start to mid point. =) I'll be coming back for more, don't worry. Anyway, we set up the initial consultation and I gave him my ideas, and we set a date some time in the future so I could save my pretty pennies for this piece. I am a woman with a budget, after all. Then, disaster struck, winter arrived and the annual furnace breakdown occurred. Ben was super understanding for my need to reschedule for, yet again, a date pretty far off in the future. By the time May rolled around, we had another consultation. For a minute I thought it had been so long that he had forgotten who I was and what I even wanted, but he had not! He even had my original pictures I had brought him 8 months earlier! We hammered out the details and I (impatiently) waited one week for the big day. \u00a0When I walked in the door, a walk in was going just ahead of me. Worry not, ladies and gents, because it was the fastest tattoo I've ever seen done, (and I assume it looked nice because the girl looked quite happy) and I was back in the chair in mere minutes. He showed me the amazing art he had drawn for my piece and I was blown away. Simply amazing. I'd show you a picture of it, but it's currently in that \"peely\" stage and I'm not going to let my skin healing mar Ben's reputation. Even in the state that it's in currently, (and also unfinished) I have gotten so many compliments on it. I know when it's completely colored in that I am going to have a piece that I will treasure always. You know because it's on my body permanently, but more importantly because it's fucking amazing. I had the chance to \"people watch\" the other artists and customers for the 3.5 hours I was in the chair, and all the artists seemed like cool people who would be able to give you a piece you're proud of. I watched one guy, whose name I didn't catch, pretty much freehand the most realistic elephant I have ever seen in my life. \u00a0This isn't to say Ben's not much for conversation, but I'm a socially awkward gal and totally suck at small talk, so I chose to spend my time checking out the art that covers the walls and \u00a0taking a peek at what other people were getting done. I guess I'm saying, unless you have any skills at running a conversation you're golden, but if you're a shy person like me, maybe it would behoove you to bring a book or something.I ramble.

I'd been thinking about getting this tattoo for a couple of years. When I decided to pull the trigger I did research and chose Stephanie based on the praise for her script work.

I emailed back-and-forth with her for quite some time and finally chose a date. She was courtious the entire time and super responsive. She even emailed me when she had a cancellation so I could come in early. When the date came I was pretty nervous, even thought about turning around and going home.

There were quite a few customers already waiting at noon (always a good sign) but even so, I was greeted immediately and never left waiting. My tattoo itself is small and only took about 5-10 minutes to complete. Stephanie took nearly an hour with me though to get the font, placement and overall aesthetic correct. She worked on it until the font was as I'd hoped, then let me bounce back-and-forth between the mirror, the bathroom and my friend. She never acted impatient; on the contrary, she encouraged me to take a multitude of looks at different angles. Once I was committed to placement she got to work. She made conversation almost the whole time and I was super comfortable with her. She even started tattooing for just a few seconds to show me how it would feel (just like a lot of little pinches, as others have said). I smiled ear to ear when I saw the finished product. All said and done, I love what she designed, how she worked and how everyone else in the studio treated me.

Today is Sunday 11-29-2015, my morning started off well, I was able to schedule my daughter Dj for a hair appointment today which is a day the Salon Oury isn't open. So I dropped her off at 12:30 today on 81st Stony Island for hair appointment. I saw a Beggars pizza shop a few stores down, so I decided to walk in. The young lady said hello, and I asked did they have slices. She replied yes, so I ordered a thin sausage and a thin pepperoni, and she asked for a name with the order, I said Carmah'. I got 2 slices in 2 separate boxes and a plastic bag. I love love hot food and to say the least Pizza is my favorite food, so I took a bite in the car as I was driving, and I took a 2nd bite, that's when something stuck me in my tongue, it was so hard my tongue started to bleed, then I spit it out in my hand. I was chewing on Packing Staples, it was at least 5 that landed in my hand. So I placed the pizza and the staples in a napkin. I drove back to Beggars on 81st and Stony Island, told the front cashier what happened and I asked for a manager, she called Demetrius and he came up and said I can give you another slice. I said no thank you I would just like my money back & what if that slice has staples in it, so you'll just keep giving me another slice Mr? Demetrius the acting manager on duty said, it says it on the receipt that we don't do refunds. I asked is it policy that if a customer has something in their food like staples or hair you tell them you don't do refunds? I reply who's over you? Demetrius said I'm the only one here with an attitude, acting like he was deaf, asking me the same thing (what you say, what you say?) I said I'm sure they have phones (& you can call them), I have to come back later so I can leave my number on the receipt for you to call me. I'am very upset that you wouldn't give me back my money when your company is at fault and my damn tongue is bleeding. He walked out of my sight, and a young guy walks in and ask for change for a $20, the young lady cashier said I can't give you change and then Demetrius said hold on I got you. Wait wait wait, I'm a customer with an issue that your policy will push to the side, but you can assists a non paying customer with change. Are you serious demetrius? I said excuse me I want my money back now, he said ok here is your $7 and some odd change (he kinda threw it at me). I have never been to an establishment and felt this way. I honestly can't believe that I was eating packing staples in a slice of Beggars Pizza and the manager refused to issue me a refund for one of the cooks baking a sausage pizza with packing staples. I'm not certain if I even ate them as when I noticed the staples it was my second bite. I would NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS BUSINESS. If you ask me Demetrius needs to be fired for his lack of professionalism and disrespect of a customers issued caused by the business. They also need better policies!!!

The hoagie can be a mess, but if you are prepared and stacked with napkins, you'll be fine. Of course, the best thing to drink with such a hoagie is a brightly-colored HFCS soda with a fruity name.

Salon provides a large and comfy waiting area. Beautifully decorated with an open floor plan. My only con is that on line booking is available and credit cards are accepted, but you have to double check with each stylist first. There is a beautiful front desk area, but no one is there to greet you or check u in.Overall, this a diamond in the rough! A modern, professional salon that's probably overlooked because of it's area.

Let me start off by saying that the inside of this place is great! Beautiful soft seats, a lovely bar as you walk in, a very upscale looking bathroom and beautiful murals of movie icons on the walls. The owners of the theater definitely took time to make this place look like a five-star establishment. However, appearances can be deceiving. First off, ordering works on a paging system. You hit a little button on the front of your table and it is supposed to signal a server to come to your table. I thought that was pretty neat and would be useful in the dark! We arrived in the middle of the previews and met our group, and a server came to take our drink orders. I had a Poolside Lemonade, and my partner had the Castaway. We also ordered the Texas-style potato skins with no onions. Our drinks did not come until 15 minutes into the movie, about half an hour after we ordered, and the potato skins came with onions on them. We sent them back and waited some more. Our drinks had absolutely no alcohol in them, mine was essentially juice. I tasted my partner's and it was just lime juice and ginger beer. A different server brought us our potato skins again with no onions, and we asked to exchange the Castaway for an Anti-Hero (beer). The server responded, \"You need to push your button.\" Rude! He couldn't even say, \"Let me get your server,\" or \"Sure, let me inform your server.\" I thought that was rude. Any other restaurant would have just taken the order. My partner ordered his entree with his drink and our appetizer, and I ordered mine a little bit later, but they both came out at the same time, about halfway through the movie. What took so long? I ordered the Chicken Run sandwich, grilled chicken with provolone cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. It came with seasoned fries. Fries were pretty standard fries. This sandwich tasted exactly like the chicken club sandwich from McDonald's, including rubbery chicken and rubbery bacon, but I was pretty hungry and was not going to wait until the movie was over to get another entree. My partner had the Porky's burger, he said it was good. We only saw our server when he took our appetizer/drink order and when he was giving us the check. I was incredibly disappointed in the food and experience at this theater. I am even more disappointed knowing that they are taking over the Hollywood Palms. Hollywood Palms has an amazing system, where orders are taken almost as soon as you sit down and the food comes out as it is ready and it is always hot and delicious. The drinks definitely have alcohol in them, the servers will get you whatever you need, no matter if they are your server or not, and there is always a server in the theater! You don't need to press a stupid button to page someone who may or may not come. I pressed the button once or twice and each time it took about 10/15 minutes for someone to get there. High volume is not really an excuse either, as HP has about the same volume of customers and gets the food and orders out quickly and correctly. I will not be returning to Star Cinema Grill, and if they implement the same policies and procedures at the Hollywood Palms in Naperville, they will lose my business as well.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 5, 30]}, "11": {"description": "This movie theater was the best experience I ever had at any theater!

We watched as other fans brought up the temperature to staff and one male associate loudly told the customer they were wrong and the air conditioning was on (well it might be on but it definitely was not working). We pay our tabs and leave from our drenched seats. The next day I check my bank statements and I was overcharged 60 dollars by the theatre. I stop by the theatre that day and speak to a manager (after asking an associate for the manager the first response was, \"actually we are looking for him and can't seem to find him\"). After explaining the situation about my account and receipt from the night before in hand, I'm told by the manager that I have to wait for the entire transaction to go thru and only after it has been completed can they give me credit. He then offers to handle the situation with better customer service and gives me an envelope, I look in it outside and was given one free movie pass.

I also plan on sending this review to Star Cinema via email. It's the holidays right? We're all busy, and trying to make time for family & friends. That's exactly what I was doing on 12/29 when I took my 15 year old sister (who lives in MI) to see Sisters. This theater is super close to my house so we opted to go here. We get to the ticket line and the girl warns us that the theater we're in is sans-heat. Has been for a few hours. Doesn't apologize, she's basically just warning us. My sister insists she'll be fine so we go for it. When I ask about the Tuesday $7 special the girl says (even though the heat is out and it's \"really cold in there\") that they don't offer it during the holiday season. Um...ok. Kinda lame but fine. Then we \u00a0get into the theater and it is FRIGID! Ice cold! My husband even had to drive a sweatshirt to us for my sister. Then I see the wait staff coming in with hot beverages. I think \"oh, maybe they're handing out complimentary cocoa for all their patrons willing to pay full price to sit through this\". WRONG AGAIN! They offered ZERO compensation! I'm not looking for anything for free here, really, but no one even apologized! No vouchers for a discount in the future, nothing! Not even small popcorn- and you KNOW they up charge like crazy for movie theater popcorn! They weren't going to lose money on us. At the very least honor your daily special admission price. It was really disappointing as far as customer service goes. Personally, if I'm a manager there and I know this heat has been off for HOURS, I'm running to Wal-mart for blankets (which I can expense) or at least offering people something hot to drink.

Let me start off by saying that the inside of this place is great! Beautiful soft seats, a lovely bar as you walk in, a very upscale looking bathroom and beautiful murals of movie icons on the walls. The owners of the theater definitely took time to make this place look like a five-star establishment. However, appearances can be deceiving. First off, ordering works on a paging system. You hit a little button on the front of your table and it is supposed to signal a server to come to your table. I thought that was pretty neat and would be useful in the dark! We arrived in the middle of the previews and met our group, and a server came to take our drink orders. I had a Poolside Lemonade, and my partner had the Castaway. We also ordered the Texas-style potato skins with no onions. Our drinks did not come until 15 minutes into the movie, about half an hour after we ordered, and the potato skins came with onions on them. We sent them back and waited some more. Our drinks had absolutely no alcohol in them, mine was essentially juice. I tasted my partner's and it was just lime juice and ginger beer. A different server brought us our potato skins again with no onions, and we asked to exchange the Castaway for an Anti-Hero (beer). The server responded, \"You need to push your button.\" Rude! He couldn't even say, \"Let me get your server,\" or \"Sure, let me inform your server.\" I thought that was rude. Any other restaurant would have just taken the order. My partner ordered his entree with his drink and our appetizer, and I ordered mine a little bit later, but they both came out at the same time, about halfway through the movie. What took so long? I ordered the Chicken Run sandwich, grilled chicken with provolone cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. It came with seasoned fries. Fries were pretty standard fries. This sandwich tasted exactly like the chicken club sandwich from McDonald's, including rubbery chicken and rubbery bacon, but I was pretty hungry and was not going to wait until the movie was over to get another entree. My partner had the Porky's burger, he said it was good. We only saw our server when he took our appetizer/drink order and when he was giving us the check. I was incredibly disappointed in the food and experience at this theater. I am even more disappointed knowing that they are taking over the Hollywood Palms. Hollywood Palms has an amazing system, where orders are taken almost as soon as you sit down and the food comes out as it is ready and it is always hot and delicious. The drinks definitely have alcohol in them, the servers will get you whatever you need, no matter if they are your server or not, and there is always a server in the theater! You don't need to press a stupid button to page someone who may or may not come. I pressed the button once or twice and each time it took about 10/15 minutes for someone to get there. High volume is not really an excuse either, as HP has about the same volume of customers and gets the food and orders out quickly and correctly. I will not be returning to Star Cinema Grill, and if they implement the same policies and procedures at the Hollywood Palms in Naperville, they will lose my business as well.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 5, 30]}, "15": {"description": "There's not many places where you can go in and dine while watching your movie.

After that all that publicity it was actually not the easiest to find. The signage isn't highly visible. It's on a corner of a tightly packed strip mall. On to the gumbo.. It was salty and overall just okay. My major issue was with the process at Anita's.-First the staff was not very accommodating: I requested to have rice and gumbo separated because I was counting carbs. I was told that this is not an option with the lunch special and they try to avoid customizations. The cashier. then added that they used to serve separately but customers reported that this was too cumbersome. Hmmm, Okay while I can appreciate that... This customer is requesting rice on the side. Oh well says Anita's, no can do, you have to order the 1/2. This essentially means no lunch special for me because I want rice &gumbo separate ... This is clearly because they want to give you a smaller portion and fill the container with mostly rice. Thats understandable because lunch options are generally smaller, so putting my rice and gumbo in 2 separate small containers seemed likes the obvious solution, but not to Anita's.
