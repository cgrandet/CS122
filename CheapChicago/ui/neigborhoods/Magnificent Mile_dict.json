Really, in the middle of Chicago with it's wondrous food options, I can't imagine many people would go out of their way to come here. The prices were what you would expect for a hotel food establishment, that is to say, on the expensive side for what you're getting. Still, on my last day leaving the hotel, might as well give it a try right? I ordered the salmon and bagel breakfast and it wasn't bad. Heaping pile of salmon, onions, capers, tomatoes, cream cheese. Pretty basic, near impossible to mess up. It hit the spot. There was only one other group there for breakfast that day so service was attentive of course, but make no mistake, they were very polite. \u00a0I was pretty happy and considered myself well fed as I said goodbye to Chicago!", "rating": "3", "date": [2016, 2, 11]}, "9": {"description": "Went here last night with a travel zoo voucher...as did every other person in the restaurant since it was expiring today. we were told it would be a 30-45min wait, which we were fine with.

I spoke with a manager and told him I understood they were in over their heads, people who were sitting weren't even being served and maybe they should honor the travelzoo voucher past tomorrow to clear some people waiting out (there was a line wrapped around and there wasn't even a hostess or anyone to take names). His response was \"no. After tomorrow your voucher is worth the value you paid\". No apologies or cares in the world, even with other people overhearing me and chiming in to agree.

When the waitress or hostess stopped by it was to ask us to remove ourselves from dining and move over to the bar. \u00a0The other tables were told the same but they like us were stranded because there weren't other seats or tables available. \u00a0So we decided to leave and found better accommodations down the street.My next visit was a few days later. \u00a0A weekday afternoon joined by another Yelper, just in time for happy hour. \u00a0Drinks are poured with a heavy hand which is usually a good thing but when the taste is so harsh you breathe fire, that's a whole other part to drinking. \u00a0It's called alcoholism. \u00a0LoL. \u00a0We started with the specialty drinks menu \"Silky margaritas. \u00a0Wow they were strong and poured into large wine glasses. \u00a0Followed by the Garden gin martini which was all gin. \u00a0For decoration a long sliver of cucumber is added. \u00a0With each sip we took, a grimace, ghastly lip curl was made. \u00a0That face one makes when they experience harsh flavor. \u00a0My buddy drank a quarter of it and told me he would not drink any more. \u00a0Specialty drinks are $12 each and the average drinker would have a decent buzz starting with the first. \u00a0I would recommend a basic cocktail and avoid specialty drinks of any nature. \u00a0We put in an order for a few appetizers which somehow got jacked up in the ordering process. \u00a0Although we pointed out the error to different parts of the wait staff the problem was never corrected until the very end when paying. \u00a0Service was negligent and people often waited over twenty plus minutes before someone was available for refills or etc's. \u00a0I feel that with the gross amount of business recently with the current offer they weren't prepared. \u00a0Instead of trying to capture new business via deal sites, management should approach nearby companies or websites which host for networking or happy hour gatherings. \u00a0Per their online menu with daily booze specials listed, I know that some of the happy hour groups I participate in would be interested.The food wasn't awesome, it was average stuff. \u00a0My buddy has worked a kitchen and felt the meat in their sliders were probably microwaved just before serving. \u00a0Of the appetizers ordered, none memorable. \u00a0The couple seated next to us enjoyed the buffalo wings and the Cajun shrimp.

She told me exactly what she would be doing and my brows looked amazing. \u00a0I was very pleased with her work and would recommend her to anyone who is going for a full, classic arch. \u00a0I will definitely be making a trip back to see her again! \u00a0A great brow expert can be hard to find!I went back to see Maggie again in July 2012 and she's just as fabulous as I remember! \u00a0So pleased with her work and she's so sweet, too. \u00a0I'll return again next time I'm in Chicago!EDIT: I understand Maggie is no longer here.

You can tell from the word go that she could care less if I were purple and eating pine cones. She's too chill to care. She asked me about my friend's birthday dinner party and if I like my brows. I've met this chick ONCE, for five minutes over 2 days before. After I picked my (hairless) chin off the floor I nearly high-fived her for her memory, and realized I owe her a review: Two days earlier I'd marched up to the brow bar to get practically my whole face waxed. I told her to thin out my brows and give me an arch. She said no - she'd never thin me out. Maggie 1: Emily 0. I took it on the chin, literally. Everything looked great after (no strays!) and I wasn't red or itchy after (I'm usually red and itchy). Will go back. Thanks, Maggie!

I walked into Macy's just to look around and spotted the Benefit Brow Bar. I knew I needed a fix up, and I saw that they offered waxing for $20 or tweeting for $25. Now I typically do threading but I figured hey, why not go for the wax? I saw Jerri finishing up a customer and she looked amazing, so I was pleased when I was told that I would be getting her. Jerri was very nice and informative, showed me my arch and the beginnings and ends of my brows, and explained that she was going to trim and shape my brows. She did an awesome job! They have an excellent staff here at Benefit, very kind and attentive. Also, the wax was really gentle, which I liked. I'm very fair and my skin is pretty sensitive (i.e. red hot after waxing for hours on end) but this wax session only left me red for 30 minutes! My brows look fabulous and I think she changed me from threading to waxing. If you get a chance to go here, definitely ask for Jerri.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 8, 4]}}, "latitude": 41.8982525914907, "neighborhoods": ["Streeterville", "Magnificent Mile", "Near North Side"], "categories": [["Eyelash Service", "eyelashservice"]], "address": ["Sephora Watertower Place", "845 N Michigan Ave, Ste 219"], "attributes": {"By Appointment Only": "No", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes"}, "longitude": -87.62401945889, "category": "Beauty", "rating": "4.5", "price": "$$", "number_of_reviews": "8"}}
