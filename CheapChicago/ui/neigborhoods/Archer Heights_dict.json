The food has always been delicious and better than home-made. Check Elizabeth P.'s profile and you will see she is a very negative person. I find it completely unfair and wrong to rate this restaurant one star because she is only getting takeout. Elizabeth should try sitting down to eat for a change and then maybe she will get the customer service that she rarely encounters (per her other reviews).The food has always tasted perfectly cooked and fresh. Complimentary tortilla chips with red and green sauce are a great start to your meal. The \"carne asada\" and the \"steak fajitas\" are my favorite but I have tried many other items from their menu and I have never been disappointed. Hand made corn tortilla's are a great treat with your meal. This is also a good place to bring your kids if they are picky eaters because of some of the good kids choices on the menu.The beer is less expensive than many other restaurants and the price difference from domestic to imported beer is also less than other places.

We had paid for a party of 100 people and about 40 showed up. Yet apparently by the end of the 3 hours NO FOOD WAS LEFT! \u00a0They even told some of our guests that they ran out of tortillas!! When they were packing up their thing we asked to see what was in the sealed aluminum trays under their grill. The servers told us it was just trays of grilled onions. We asked them to show us. So the tray was flung on the table and when we opened it we saw that it was a full tray of chicken there was another full tray of rice!

Unfortunately we we didn't catch the servers from the last party but numerous guests told us that they had seen them put the extra food in their vehicle when they packed up at the end of the party. After the party on 7/19 some of more of our guests told us that they had gone up to ask for more food and the servers had told them that they were out of tortillas!!!!! Yet at the end of the night when we asked them to leave us everything that we PAID for they took out about 15 dozen tortilla packets from under the grill that they lug around to all the parties they cater. We called the owner to inform him about what his employees had done in TWO of our parties. He seemed very shocked but he did say that the only food the servers are asked to bring back are the tortillas?!? So do we get a refund for that??? Because according to their contract we paid for them! Let me tell you having them come out and serve at your party is not cheap, we paid $700 for 100 people 3 years ago we paid $480 for the same amount. So you know that these businesses are making a huge profit especially if they are keeping the extra food you paid for. \u00a0So taco lovers beware if you want to have happy guests and get your money's worth then keep an eye on the servers or you will be ripped off and have hungry guests!

This place does get crowded on game days and on weekend nights as they close late. I do recommend trying one of these BIG delicious burgers for yourself.

I just recently turned 21 on the 11th and I decided to go get a beer and a burger and what's convinient is that it's two blocks away from my house. So upon arriving, I scanned the place and it was cozy. I sat on the wooden booths that are located immediately on the left upon entering the establishment. I waited roughly 5 minutes if not a little bit less and got greeted by a fairly young looking lady. She was very friendly, so I asked for a menu and got it. The menu seems a bit different than the one that's available online. So around 5 minutes into looking at the menu she came back and asked if I was ready. And I got their famous Chicago burger or whatever it's called with bacon and a side of fries and a corona. I got the corona right away and it was nice and cold with a lime wedge. It did take quite a bit to get my order but there was a lot of people who ordered prior to my arrival. It took around 15-20 minutes but it's no biggie. I really don't care as long as I get my order correct. So once I got it, my jaw dropped. It was humongous! And the fries looked delicious. Now, at the time I got my order one really polite chick came to give me my order. She was also fairly polite and amicable. This was literally one of the best burgers I've had. The fries are good. But the burger. Wow. My end total was roughly $20.80 and I gave 15% tip. So it wasn't that bad. 4$ per corona. The only thing that I didnt find attractive which is why I didn't give it full stars is the fact that small children are around an adult environment and the fact that neither one of the servers/bartenders asked for an ID when I requested liquor. They can have that establishment closed if they continue to do that regardless how old someone looks and that would be a huge disappointment to have it closed because of something like that.

Their dark chocolate is a lot less bitter than normal dark chocolate which gives it a nice flavor for people who aren't a fan of dark chocolate in general. They also have an amazing chocolate meltaway, chocolate coconut and chocolate with carmel with a couple other little guys. I'd say they'd make a great holiday gift, or something to munch on at home on a regular basis. Secondly is their factory. I visited recently with a group of people and the management staff was incredibly friendly, generous, and knowledgeable not only about chocolate but about their process too. The factory is laid out fairly simply. You start where they break down cocoa beans into a chocolate liqueur at one end and you end up with finished products that are wrapped, boxed, and ready to ship on the other. I have to give this place a great review, as well as their products.", "rating": "4", "date": [2008, 11, 6]}, "16": {"description": "The Groovy Gummies Suck, they were so tasty last year...What happened???

This is my experience and only my experienceMy wife, my daughter and I decided to visit Machetes on a Saturday afternoon. They have parking at the bank, but we found street parking very easy. The place was full but found a table. Walking inside the restaurant you can smell the fresh made corn tortillas, the wonderful aroma, and imagine the toothsome texture of nixtamalized corn. After looking at the menu and discussing who was ordering what (we wanted to try all of them), we ordered 3 quesadillas. Mushrooms, half rajas and cactus, and half huitlacoche and zucchini flower, also 2 coffees and water.While authentic quesadillas are greatly different than your typical Mexican grub (Tacos de Asada) that most Americans are use to, I grew up eating Mole, Nopales, Huitlacoche, Flor de Calabaza, etc... As Mi Abuelita and my mom where culinary gurus, this better be an \"A\" Game!My wife had rajas and cactus and she swears that it was the cherry on top... My daughter ordered the mushrooms quesadilla and she really cleaned her plate... I had the squash blossoms with a nice sweet flavor. \u00a0The huitlacoche was as expected with a funky fungi/mushroom flavor with a hint of smoke and corn.Quesadillas were tasty and good size. Not the type you get from Mexican taco places with good quality cheese and not the greasy giant oozy cheese kind that lead to obesity, more the kind that makes you happy eating it because it hits the spot without making you feel like crap later. I have seen other quesadilla places make them with cheap cheese like Food, Nuestro Queso, and El Mexicano which are low quality and too greasy to use in quesadillas. Also, there's a condiments bar with salsas, chopped onions, etc. that we really enjoyed. Some of the salsa are very very spicy... But we went for more.Vegetarians, have no fear, there are good vegetarian options as well as cheese-less to take the full flavor of the fresh made tortilla with your favorite filling... All are VERY good. I've tried various spots in Chicago area including Little Village, Pilsen, Cicero, etc... and this one did not disappoint us. The prices are competitive, employees are ok, but need to work with their people skills, the place needs more decor, and bathrooms in the front. But I'm there to share good food with my family and not to have a conversation with the employees or admire art on the walls.

I would not call it all style, it is americanized chinese food and sushi buffet.They still have a fairly big customers for lunch due to their less than 10 bucks menu after tax.", "rating": "3", "date": [2010, 9, 24]}, "2": {"description": "I have to say that this was not our first choice of buffet to go too but our regular buffet was closed and we were all hungry and ready to get our grub on but at an inexpensive price.We didn't make the lunch buffet which is 7.99 but we made it for the dinner buffet which is 11.19 starting at 3pm.I hate to say immediately I wished this wasn't our second choice but I was with friends and family to celebrate a birthday and at the end of the day that is what was most important but I can't tell you how I wished we had got there earlier to save some money on this mediocre food.Now, I know some say what do you expect when you aren't paying that much for the food; Well I will tell you this, I may not be expecting lobster and filet mignons but I sure do expect the food to be flavorful, eatable, replenished when the food trays are emptied and most importantly digestible.I will give you a quick scenario and I don't blame the restaurant for this but I am saying we should have to pay the price for other customers acting like they are the only ones in the restaurant. \u00a0They had some Pepper Shrimp with the heads on but they tasted so good(I can give them an A plus on this selection) Anyway, people were taking mounds of it, matter a fact one table had three people come up and just about empty the pan. \u00a0We(the other customers) stood around like a pack of hungry animals waiting for them to bring more for almost 15 minutes and they still didn't add more shrimp to the pan. \u00a0I went to sit down because the food I did have on my plate was getting cold. \u00a0My girl's mom went back up and just as the vultures were about to attack the pan again she got me some and that was the only way I was able to taste them.The grill was just disgusting the beef was a greyish type of brown, the chicken was slimy and old looking and I couldn't believe they had it siting out or that people were getting it as a part of their stir-fry...Yeah, I skipped that experience. \u00a0I am a sushi eater and it is one of my favorite foods. I'm trying not to sound like a big baby but yuck yuck pooie and yes I did say that without hesitation. \u00a0It was just not fresh and it didn't really look appetizing but I thought I would give it a try. \u00a0Now, don't get me wrong they had a few items that were tasty and flavorful but they had so many other ones that weren't that it overshadowed the so few dishes that were worth putting on your plate.The bathrooms weren't that clean and if I didn't have to go I wouldn't have went and I will leave it at that.I have to say the staff except for a couple were very friendly and nice but it wouldn't make me want to come back but I do thank them for being observant and helpful.They don't have a wide selection of desserts which was disappointing for our birthday boy.They did have a soft serve ice cream which did taste good but you can't really mess up ice cream, can you?I have to say at the end of the day we had fun not because the food was exceptional, or the place was uber clean(cuz it wasn't) but because the 7 of us enjoyed each others company and laughed so hard together that the food and this place played in the background of our family time. \u00a0All in All I can't say I won't be back because you just never know but if I had a list of buffets because my favorite buffet is closed this one won't be my second choice.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 5, 1]}, "18": {"description": "I'm writing this review after just walking inside my home after spending approximately 15 minutes at this place. What led me to this place was a coupon I printed off the Valpak.com site to get a $5.99 lunch buffet. When I went to the counter and asked the clerk if they are still accepting this coupon, she told me yes, but I had to pay $7.99 for the regular buffet to get the $5.99 buffet. As soon as she explained this to me, I looked down and on the counter, I saw a sheet explaining buffet pricing. From Monday-Friday, during lunch, get a buffet to go for just $2.99 a pound, and dinner buffet Monday-Saturday for only $3.99 a pound! I've never heard of anything like this before!So I decided to get the lunch buffet to go, going around the aisles of the eatery in search of delicious things to fill my to-go container, and delicious things I would find. Stuffed mushrooms, baked flounder, BBQ pork skewers, authentic crabmeat pieces, sushi-cream cheese and California rolls and raw fish sushi-slab of raw fish over solid rice ball, cheese pizza, brownies, cupcakes, macaroni and cheese, slices of oranges, cantaloupes, melons, and a host of other delicious goodies and munchies! Total cost for the things I listed (I got every single one that I mentioned except for orange and melon slices and the raw fish sushi) was only $6.31! Yes, that's right, $6.31! Damn good deal! Oh my gosh, I have got to come back to this place, probably within the next 2.5 weeks or so, but with my severe time restrictions, there's no guarantee that I will. Nevertheless, it is worth the money. Very inexpensive, and the customer service is great! NOTICE: If you want to pay using either debit or credit, what I used today, you have to purchase a minimum of $5 in food.Something else that makes me give this place five stars is that, in between the register and the dining area, there's a mini pond, filled with beautiful orange fish, live of course.

Another thing that sets them apart from the norm are the Tamales, red, green and sweet, always fresh and plentifull on the weekends, they tend to run out on the weekdays, very rich and tender, and super cheap. \u00a0Brian said the restaurant had a comfort food quality to it and I will agree 100%, a wonderful lady usually seen on the weekends prepping or working the counter is the owners sister, she has developed the signature recipes and is one of the friendliest hosts in Chicago, the only problem is she isn't there enough. On several occasions she has brought me free samples of Chicken Croquettas, (a fried fritter like concoction) Empanadas, (the best I have ever had), and her version of Ensalata de \u00a0Nopales, (cactus salad) this is another of the weekend specials. This version of the salad features Extra virgin olive oil , aged cheese, and a lot of love. \u00a0Other highlites include tacos pastor and the steak milanesa. \u00a0 Service can be a bit stoic and impersonal, but has never prevented me from enjoying the food. \u00a0Why only 4 stars? \u00a0Because of the high quality of some of the dishes, some less popular dishes tend to suffer, Burritos are average, enchiladas lack the balance of my favorites, and if you are craving a Tamale on a weekday, you should go elsewhere. Also I have noticed, even though I am a regular of 3 years, as a gringo I will have to request hot sauce for the table, the Hispanic population gets it automatically, doesn't anger me, I actually find it humorous. \u00a0As far as the drinks go, BYOB, the Horchata is very well balanced and the Agua Frescas (fruity drinks) are consistently good. \u00a0So come in on a Saturday for lunch, order a Carnitas plate, a Tamal, and enter the wonderful world of pig, FYI when you order the Carnitas they may ask if you want Pig only? \u00a0This means meat only, if you want the full experience say \"con chicharon\" \u00a0with skin baby, crispy and fatty a perfect complement to the tender slow cooked pork.

I'm not embarrassed to admit that after my first visit I returned and brought my friends for 3 consecutive days in a row. So yes so far I've gone to this location 4 times in 1 week and have sampled every cookie on display (only in the counter- there are larger ones in the cabinet I haven't hit yet) and most of the cakes. Here is my descriptive verdict.Cakes:Best seller: Coconut Pineapple cake. I thought this cake was delicious and the fruits complimented each other wonderfully. If you only plan on coming once...try this cake cause I think it was thee best I've tasted so far and I highly doubt you will be disappointed.Strawberry Cream with Strawberries: Is a close second. One of the friends I took preferred this cake over the coconut so if you are not much of a coconut/pineapple fan then def. order the strawberry. Raspberry Chocolate: Was pretty rich but still moist and decadent. If you have a strong sweet tooth I recommend this treat.Oreo Cookies n Cream: Was probably my least favorite. Only because it tasted pretty typical. Nothing too unique about this order yet still tasty.Caramel cream and Pecan: I loved the Pecan pieces! Overall a satisfactory slice of sugar. =)I have yet to try the orange or the cheesecake. Perhaps on my next visit...now onto the cookies!Cookies:Best Seller: Pecan Bars...and for good reason. Everyone I've allowed to taste these treats agrees that these are the best they have. Perfect coffee cookies.Mexican wedding cake: Also delicious and my second favorite. Crumbly, moist, yummy.Orange cookies: A very nice hint of orange. Do recommend. Macaroons: Wonderfully bite sized. They have a crispy and fairly hard exterior but the inside is so moist and delicious. Definitely one of my favorites here. Chocolate Chip/Pecan cookies: I thought these were pretty good but a little harder to chew than I prefer. My friends noted that this was not their favorite but I liked them just fine.Lemon Balls: Pretty good but I would pass.Mocha cookies: I'm not a huge fan of \u00a0coffee flavored goodies but my friend is and she very much enjoyed. Pastitas (Shortbread cookie with raspberry or apricot center): They were okay but I wouldn't reorder. Cinnamon sugar cookies: Pretty good but again not my favorite. The prices here are very reasonable as well. A little over $2 for a slice of cake (Yelp offers a buy one get one free!...hence my indulgence) and the cookies are 0.35 cents each- or about $4 for 1/2lb...cheap! Their coffees are about $2 as well so for as little as $6 I can walk away with a very content palette.

Well, the first time I went I was told the cupcakes would be $1.25 but of course I was able to get a taste of one, which was okay (although not the caliber of the Cupcakes for Courage or the Flirty Cupcakes I am accustomed to), but why should they be, the others are over $3.25 and $3.75 respectively, but still $1.25 a cupcake here is really not bad. \u00a0Now the next day I returned and bought two more parfaits and a few other things such as lemon meringue tart and the other a fruit tart that I used my YELP check-in to get for FREE!

Pulaski, attempting to head back north during pre-rush hours. \u00a0I knew that this place wouldn't have anything vegetarian for hubby since their dishes focus on \"goat\" as the primary source of meat. \u00a0Yet he was curious and wondering whether or not goat would cause any discomfort on his stomach. \u00a0After all, he became a \"part-time\" vegetarian because he experienced ongoing stomach problems and illnesses due to the consumptions of meat and poultry. \u00a0Well, obviously his stomach could deal with goat just fine. \u00a0The owner, who shares 95% similarity with the famous George Clooney, warmly greeted us and invited us to sit down anywhere we liked. \u00a0The entire dining room was fairly small, and the wall decors had nothing fancy or special. \u00a0The young lady server quickly approached to our table with an i-pad in her hands (small businesses' favorite piece of technology). \u00a0We wanted horchata (of course) while we were perusing through the menu. \u00a0The menu is relatively simple. \u00a0In summary, there are three (3) types of entrees to choose from: tacos, quesadilla, and small/large plates. \u00a0All entrees feature goat as the sole protagonist. \u00a0We went with two (2) orders of Plate Chico (small size) and added the warm salsa served in a molcajete. \u00a0That salsa was spicy, but that spiciness was so smooth that I kept on eating it with my spoon, one scoop after another. \u00a0Their goat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. \u00a0I know it wasn't easy to cook goat meat without sacrificing one (1) criterion for another. \u00a0Nevertheless, Birrieria Zaragoza did it! \u00a0We asked for extra tortilla because that salsa was just that awesome! \u00a0By the way, the horchata was also delicious. \u00a0I liked how they used the crushed ice instead of the full-sized ice cubes. \u00a0The full-sized ice cubes tend to dilute the horchata mix. \u00a0Yes, there's always science behind food-making. \u00a0The owner (Mr. Clooney...was that you?) and all workers at the restaurant were very welcoming and beyond friendly. \u00a0I can't wait to come back!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 3, 23]}, "1": {"description": "The three star ranking is not because the birria is not delish but because of the way the owners overprice everything to the point of nickle and diming you..my husband is from Jalisco...(the primary state birria originated from and whenever we go...we always have to get us some birria) so I would classify myself as a birria specialist..and insomuch as in Jalisco as many of the other Birrerias in the city..i can tell you that the broth (consome) IS part of the birria..and here they charge you addtl if you want it with the broth...I can totally understand charging extra if we want EXTRA consome but charging it from the get-go is just crazyI will explain via analogy...It's like making chicken noodle soup and charging you extra for the broth....that is just NOT nice and a way to overcharge an already overpriced dish..(perhaps because of the label \"organic goats\" that gets tossed around and easily manipulated...but hey it's their business and they can charge \u00a0whatever they want and its up to the consumer to decide.The homemade tortillas are very good...However, their homemade molcajete salsa was NOT hot nor did it really have any outstanding flavor to it.(and again..they charge extra for that)..the salsa they do have gratuitous tasted like something store bought...They will also charge more for taking the bones out...( i hope im proving my point by this time)Which I did ask to b taken out and I still had lots of tiny fragments of bone....so it wasnt even worth paying extra for that since they didnt do a very good job...All in all..the birria is pretty good in comparison to other places we have tried but out of principle..we certainly will not be returning.One of the other reviewers..Cristaldo said it best...\"Too many hidden fees..Trying to act like they're a fancy restaurant. \"", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 12, 18]}, "55": {"description": "If you can get here, you need to come here.

If you feel full after eating here will most likely be from the tortillas not the birria. The dining space is the size of the average house dining room (not very big) and it's difficult to find seating.

In fact they plant 11 trees for every shirt sold and 3 trees for every bracelet sold to help fight against deforestation. Hemp Helps is a great company that has teamed up with another gem 'Trees for the future' who have planted over 100 million trees throughout Asia, Latin America & Africa=) I am a BIG supporter of Hemp related clothing for several reasons. To me Hemp clothing provides all the warmth, softness and durability that are seldom found in other materials. Hemp is extremely versatile and can be used for countless other products product's not to mention it is earth-friendly. I began scrolling through Hemp Helps website and found a couple of shirts I really dug. Anyone who knows me knows I am a t-shirt & jeans type of guy when away from work. So when I spotted a couple of amazing finds on Hemp Helps website I knew I had to purchase them. When it came time to check-out and pay for my items I was stoked to see that shipping within the confines of the United States is free=) After placing my order I received a confirmation email that my package was being shipped and it arrived quite quickly. When my package arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find my shirt wrapped in recyclable brown paper. Inside of the hand wrapped package my t-shirt was wrapped in a hemp bag that can be used for trips to the beach. As I explored the bag \u00a0future I found a bracelet which I gave to a friend under one condition if anyone asked where she got it she would not only tell them it is made from hemp but direct them to the Hemp Helps website. I felt like a kid walking down the stairs on Christmas morning. I found stickers in my hemp bag along with several inspirational quotes. I believe everything happens for a reason and I was meant to stumble upon this website and I am so glad that I did. I washed my hemp t-shirt as instructed and let it hang dry and it fits perfectly. I actually tried it on before I washed it and found it to be just as comfortable and it fit perfectly after it was washed. If you are looking to support a great cause and look stylish at the same time look no further than Hemp Helps. It is nice to see that local business folks Andy & Bart the co-founders of Hemp Helps are out there and being the good. They have earned a lifelong customer because of their core values, beliefs, where their money ends up and the quality of product they are producing while being eco-friendly!!!Since 1937, about half the World's forests have been cut down to make paper. If hemp had not been outlawed, most would still be standing today oxygenating the planet. I will sign this review off with a random fact. The USS Constitution 'Old Ironsides' had 60 tons of hemp.

The problem that I had was with a waitress. A cousin of mine and her finace came to visit from Michigan state. They wanted to eat pizza. What better pizza right? We were a group of 6, plus my cousin's newborn baby. First of all, the waitress that we got couldn't speak english. Most of us speak spanish, but that's not the point. The fact that we were specifically paired up with this lady annoyed me right of the bat. Why? there was a group of 5 (african americans) that got there after we did, but were seated before. Their waiter spoke english! I guess they figured they would sit the latinos and give them the waitress that can't speak english. She stood at the end of the table handing us our drinks. She gave my cousin a drink, she gave it to me, I gave it to my hubby :/ She brought the appetizers out and kept handing them to my cousins, instead of just placing them on the table. When the pizza came out, same thing. WE had to move the empty plates out of the way and make room for the pizza because she decided to put it right in front of the baby's seat. She was no where to be found for refills. When we finally got her, we had to make sure to order anything else that we wanted. I forgot to mention, she also stood by my cousin (the new mom) and was asking her personal questions. Like, is she breastfeeding. When my cousin answered yes, she then told her that she was going to give her some \"tips.\" O_o \u00a0She told her not to go out with her shoulders exposed (she was wearing a strapless shirt), because that would cause her milk \"to evaporate.\" I was annoyed and asked her if she could just please go get us our drinks (we didn't have our drinks yet, but she was giving ADVISE). I don't know. I was just annoyed at the whole situation. My cousin's and hubby were too. I was going to ask for the manager, but my husband didn't want \u00a0me too. I think I should have. She was sooo unprofessional, that it was just annoying. By the way, I did ask her at one point if she was new. She said she wasn't. I would have understood if she was.
