I felt guilty going to Starbucks, McDonalds or Cafe Bacci downtown when I can spend my dollars with a Black owned fledgling business instead.Yesterday, I was under the weather and decided to go to the restaurant for a sandwich and some soup. I walked in the restaurant 15 minutes before closing and gave the server my order. She told me that they turn off the panini press 15 minutes before closing and that the bread would not be toasted.I told her that would be fine and go ahead and prepare the sandwich. Two women were standing behind the counter with her and they were visibly upset when the server agreed to take my order. She turned and asked one of them to make the sandwich and they both looked at each other as if to say \"Huh, I know she is not talking to me!\".The older lady looked at me in such a mean way, turned around while shaking her head in disgust because my prescence made it inconvenient for her to go home on time. She walked slowly to the kitchen still shaking her head and doing this infront of their children that were in the restaurant.I told the server that I didn't want the sandwich because the lady didn't want to make it. I was so upset I turned and left while the server asked me to wait. I felt like I was asking them for a favor instead of purchasing food from a restaurant. There is never a welcoming feeling when you enter that place. You are not greeted with a smile or assisted with the menu. I would be so happy to serve my customers that i would go all out to make them feel welcomed.I would not recommend this place for lunch because you are made to feel like an outsider. The customer service is poor and I would be surprised if they were around in five years. I told other people about my experience and they vowed not to give them a chance.

I am waiting for a couple of people to get done ordering. The OWNER takes my order and I proceed to order a breakfast sandwich. She stops me and explains that it is after 10. I'm looking confused because it's like 2 minutes passed 10am and I have been waiting in line for a couple of minutes. She says again that they do not do breakfast after 10. THEN SHE LET'S ME WALK OUT THE DOOR. 3. I am using my debit card and I give her my out of state ID. She asked if I had an IL ID, I tell her no. She says, well next time you need an IL ID if you want to buy food from here. Just to name a few.

Here are brief reasons of all the things that went wrong (this is really brief there is more detail to it) :1. She canceled my appointment that I made 5 days in advance the day before. And she did not call me to tell me. I called her to confirm. She agreed I was still good for Sunday. She called me back later and said can I change for next week. So I had to were my hair out for a week. 2. She quoted me $180 for small individual braids that reach the bra strap. I was very specific with her about what I wanted because I hate surprise charges when you get there. Sure enough that's what happened.The lady said it was $200 and up for what I wanted. I told her no Eva said $180 and never have I paid more than $180 for them. I called Eva and she did not answer. To avoid the hassle, I agreed to the 200. 3. They did not have the \u00a0hair color I wanted. I asked Eva what type of hair she uses and if she had the color I wanted. If she didn't have it, it wouldn't have been a problem I would have just bought my own. She didn't know what type of hair she used but was sure she had plenty of dark brown. I get there they only had black and light brown. They lady says they never order dark brown. 4. The braids were not done correctly. the lady doing the back of my hair kept doing it wrong. She was making them big. so the braid would start off fat and then skinny on down. Also, she started the braid off in plaits, so if you wanted to do a ponytail you couldn't make one. The parts were huge, so they can rush through it. 5. They kept talking about my hair and the whole price situation in their language. since it was of french dialect I understood a lot of it. They also said to do it bigger since I was only paying $200. 6. My scalp was itching for about 2-3 weeks. I have no idea why. 7. They left small pieces of my hair out. In different areas, also. 8. After 4 weeks, my hair is untangling, frizzy at the end, and a mess. I'm trying to make it to six weeks. \u00a0Seriously, since the day I got it done I've been keeping it in french braid because it did not look good out. Positives: the place is clean.

Instead of offering to buy me new ones she hands me some black headphones that are not apple quality and do not fit in my ears. \u00a0I gave them back . I don't complain I sit back in the chair to finish my appointment The girls working on my hair complains that it is taking too long and begins cutting my hair shorter.\" HOLD ON?? YOU ARE CUTTING MY REAL HAIR!!\" I TELL HER. I tell her multiple times to stop cutting because that is where my real hair is. I even show her AND EVA a pic of my real hair before I got braids. SHE CONTINUES TO CUT ANYWAYS. \u00a0 Now I have VERY LARGE chunks of hair missing from my natural hair style. DO NOT GO HERE!!!Then after all of my hair has been taken down, Eva tells me \" You have to come back tomorrow to finish because you want small braids.\"........ We made an appointment for me to get them done today? So now I have to waist a whole day back in here tomorrow?OKAY? So I go back the next day. Eva is not there when I arrive. The ladies doing my hair do not do the first braid correctly. They argue with me about the braids I want. I'm paying them. Do not do my hair the way I don't want it. So she redoes the one braid, and then shows it to me. it is the correct width. DO YOU KNOW THAT IS THE ONLY BRAID SHE DID CORRECTLY? ALL THE OTHERS ARE THE SIZE SHE WANTED THEM TO BE.This woman tricked me by doing one braid the size I wanted so I would agree. Needless to say, my hair is not the length, width or style I want it to be. And Eva charged me \u00a0$270. I paid her because I know business. Everyone else says I shouldn't of paid her and I should've walked out. This isn't a rant, it is an awareness message for ANYONE wanting professional haircare. Eva is rude and NOT a professional.

She listened to what \u00a0I wanted and ensured I had a good experience. She engaged me in conversation and allowed me to watch TV. Eva did my braids her self, but it took much longer than I would have liked. She charged me $180 for senegalese braids, and did them long (which I liked at first). After a few weeks I thought there were a little too long for me, and especially heavy on my neck. I knew the next time I went I would get them a \"natural\" length that will make it easier for washing and general upkeep. Also, she had a credit card machine which made it much more convenient. Positives: neat, meticulous, clean shop, decent pricing, credit card machine, braids lasted for about 5monthsNegatives: took over 7 hrs, braids were too long, I had to curl the ends myself. 2nd experience: Over the phone I was told that the same braids would be $200 now since they do them long, when I asked about adding color, she said she had the color I wanted. Since I didnt want them long, I asked if it would be less, she said yes. Upon getting there, and reminding her about the color, she brought out a auburn color, and not a burgundy red like I initially asked for! I didnt even know what the color was until they started towards the front of my head (my mistake) so I went with it anyway. At the end of the day it turned out nice, but I still wished it was a little darker. This time she also called in someone to help (thank God!) so that was a plus. She asked me the length and i said (like yours) at the time her braids were shoulder length. Not paying any attention, I noticed that they kept adding hair. She also told me the price would still be $200! WHAT! ok so now you are doing them long and I asked for shoulder lenght, and you are still charging me more.. hmmm!When it was all said and done, she curled them this time. Ok cool. when it came time to pay, I handed her my check card. She looked at me like I was crazy and said \"we dont take that anymore, you can go to the atm across the street.\" Umm no, Im not paying a fee to take money out when you never told me you dont take cc until now! so I found an atm from my bank about a mile away and told her I wuold be back. She then asked me if it was ok if her helper would ride with me (ok what so now you think im not coming back, I would have left collateral). Fine! So I go to get the money and came back and gave it to the girl and dropped her off. WHAT AN INCONVENIENCE. Positives: Same service as before but faster, braids lasted about 4 months, clean shop/ bathroom. Negatives: braids were STILL too long. All and all Eva's still provides a great service, you just have to be VERY specific and VERY assuring of what you want and are getting.

She said I was early even though I was only five minutes early and she left and said shed be back because she needed to buy some hair. Ok. She didnt come back quickly and instead a coworker came and said Eva told her to come see me, this was about twenty five minutes after my scheduled appt. I was hesitant because I only knew Eva was good, which was why I made an appt to see her, but let her coworker proceed to just make things easier. The woman seemed nice but took all the twists out that she was redoing at once which meant she would have no way of comparing the size of the originals with the new ones. When Eva finally came back she first ate dinner and then joined in (but left after maybe an hour and let the other woman finish the job). I wasnt uncomfortable as they were twisting and wasnt sitting in front of a mirror so I just trusted that they were doing a good job. It also took long enough for me to assume that they werent skimping and making the twists bigger than the originals to save time. Boy was I wrong! When they were finally done and I Iooked in the mirror I saw the new twists were noticeably bigger than the old. Awesome. I was told that this was done so that my natural hair wouldnt come undone like had been happening with the old twists. Since there was nothing I could do but try to make more of the hair match I asked if I could come back and have them touch up more for a better look. I was told thatd be fine but when I called I never got a call back. Funny thing is the twists they just did are already unraveling and I also now have tiny white bumps around the front of my scalp.

They were usually late but their service made up for that and I just began to arrive later. Last year I began my journey to healthy hair after a lot of heat damage and \u00a0did twist out styles mainly. About a month ago i decided it was time for my big chop and wanted to do protective styles for a while so my hair could grow more. The day after I cut 70% of my hair off I go to Eva. When I got there, We would always discuss a little before on the length I wanted. Then some other lady, who is not as skilled as Eva, started on my hair. She didn't ask me what length I wanted (I also forgot to tell her so its a fault on both sides) so about 1/5 of the way through I remember and say that I want the braids bra length. She then had an attitude (rightfully so). My mother and I offered to help take them out so she could start again but she just kept doing the waist length and ignoring all of our requests.Finally she finished my hair and it looked awful. The ends were terrible, they had little knots on the end (which i've never seen them do before), they were still a little longer than i liked but I didn't want to complain anymore. Right when I was about to leave, Eva walks into the store and I tell her about the incident. She tells me that if they unravel I can come back and she'll redo them no cost. Of course the next day they unravel, and I have to go back two days later. When I go back they redo the front and back and did it very roughly. The hair still didn't look good when they redid it because they braided it halfway down and the other half was straight because they wanted to save time.

The person who was supposed to do my hair arrived late, which I would have been fine with if my hair had been done well. I repeatedly said that I didn't want my hair braided too tightly because I had experienced \u00a0SIGNIFICANT hair loss in the past from braids that were done too tightly. I said this repeatedly and I had indicated that I wanted the hair to go just slightly past my shoulders. None of this was heeded and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the braids aren't done evenly. They're made to be fat at the beginning and skinny towards the end. Maybe this is a style and the stylist didn't know what I meant when I said that I'd wanted box braids that were a little less then a pencil in diameter. I used to get my hair braided back in the 90s before some of the newer styles came in and I'm not familiar with all the things they do these days, so I really tried to give the hair dresser the benefit of the doubt.When I mentioned \u00a0the uneven size of the braids to the person doing my hair, the lady at first tried to deny it but then added more hair to the length as she went on. So by the end of the sitting I just wanted to be done and out. She trimmed off the stray hair (which wouldn't have been necessary if the hair length had been uniform) and she went about it very vigorously so I was terrified that she had cut some of my natural hair. At this point, I really was just tired and wanted to get out so I paid 200 even though I was quoted 180 and just got out of there.

I lived in the Bronzeville Area during the time that the store opened. Being fashion forward, i was always intrigued by the beautiful items in the window. I must admit this boutique has beautiful clothing and accessories, however the service i received, was unacceptable. When shopping at a boutique, i expect to find one of a kind clothing that will not be reordered. I purchased a jumpsuit last year for $150. The jumpsuit was absolutely beautiful and it was the last one on the mannequin. I was urged to purchase it because it was the last of its kind. Well, a month later i came into the store and there was the same jumpsuit in 3 different colors with what seemed like endless inventory. My issue with that is, when spending that kind of money on an item, I would not expect for a store to reorder the item especially at that capacity. To top things off, I found two other boutiques who were selling the exact same item for $105. I do expect for companies to make a profit.... that is completely understandable, but after doing my research, I found that the item was $42 per unit. (No wonder they decided to reorder a bus load with such a large profit margin.) I also purchased a bracelet for $60 the same day i purchase the jumpsuit. Well... I went on Clark and Wilson and purchased the same (exact) bracelet for $8. This is not being profitable, but taking advantage. The mark up is outrageous in the store, but this is not what prompted me to stop shopping there. It seemed as though every time i came into the store, It would be one extreme or the next in the way i was treated. Either i would be completely ignored (if i wasn't \"dressed\" for the day) or i was attacked and aggressively followed around the store as if i was the only customer they had that day. I explained that i wasn't big on rhinestones, however they kept trying to force the tacky rhinestoned shirts and sweaters on me. The sales people were aggressive to the point where it was a turn off. After an experience that i had about an exchange (for a larger size, after a nearly $500 purchase- story too long to tell) I vowed that i would never shop at a place who didn't appreciate my support again. I also haze my friends when they mention the store. They all know how passionate i am about business, professionalism, and customer service and i was not at all impressed. So when the email was sent to do a review on Yelp, 3 of my friends forwarded it to me, and i am gladly sharing my experience. *Disclaimer* I have not stepped foot into this store in over a year and a half, so maybe, just maybe, the service and prices have changed.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 6, 25]}, "0": {"description": "What I Love: the e-flyers and videos - the art. the fashion. the creativity. the pieces are smartly priced and the customer service is definitely above average.

All of the workers with the exception the manager looked like they had just rolled right out of bed after a long night on the town. No one wore hair nets despite the long weaves and shoulder length braids and cornrows that dangled from every waiter and waitresses head and into the plates of diners. AND then the food came! Uuuugh. Their idea of an omelet; four leaves of spinach between 2 to 3 eggs that were cooked to hell and sprinkled w/ the cheapest cheese. Well you should just forget about the seasoning.The pancakes were raw in the middle. My mom requested crisp bacon. However, when her bacon arrived it was still flopping on the plate. So when we made mention to the waitress she had my mom remove the bacon from her plate onto another plate. The waitress then whisked the bacon off to the kitchen. She then came back with the SAME pieces of bacon that had been nuked for 2 additional seconds and brought to the table, now, only half way flopping on the plate. It took us exactly 25 minutes to receive our food-- not counting the time we sat waiting to be acknowledged or given water. Ooooh, after all of this I almost forgot to mention, the food was cold. I spoke with the manager Cynthia who was nice and seemed to be receptive to feedback. She never communicated that she would be taking a portion off of our bill. She just delivered the bill and I guess we were supposed to be grateful that she took off a portion of the bill. We certainly did not expect her to comp a portion of the bill as we had fully planned on paying. We still gave our waitress a tip for okay service and bad food. I will say that Abby our initial waitress was good but 2 other random workers/waitresses actually delivered our food. Umm where did they come from???? I was excited to try this place and was looking forward to having a place to dine as it is located right in my neighborhood. I don't think I will ever be back.

However, they have to receive 1 star for the horrible experience my wife and I had today. Apparently, they were short staffed today, which is never a problem, if the establishment (I.e. Management) knows how to strategically place everyone. We should have known to turn around from the door once we entered. The wait was very short, about 5 minutes, if we wanted a table. We requested a booth but noticed that several tables and booths were available yet dirty. We inquired about the available booths and were told they would be ready soon. About 10 minutes later we were finally seated. Ok. A little rough start.Things took a turn for the worst when we sat for about 15 mins before someone came over to give us water. When the person brought the water, they did not greet us. They just sat the water down and left. We started to think: Ok, maybe this wasn't the best idea but the food is great. Let's just stay. As we sat there, we noticed that the servers were just aimlessly walking around: some going to the same tables over and over, some just gazing off and others conversing with each other. At this point, my wife and I are frustrated. We angrily stare and try to flag down several servers to come take our orders. Finally, one server (who was already carrying almost the whole restaurant) came and said I'll get your server. 5 minutes later, she came by the table again, saw we had not been served and took our orders. She was very apologetic and explained how understaffed they were today. She became our saving grace for the rest of the time there. My wife called for the manager. Christopher C., the manager at the time of our service, came over to inquire about what was happening for us. When my wife explained about the lack in service we had been receiving, he gave us this half assed excuse about how he too has been \"shocked\" at the service today. Sir, how can you be shocked at the service if you are the one coordinating it? He continued to fumble through his excuses and gave us some apologies. He then offered to give us a free drink for our Inconvenience. Yeah. That surely makes up for our inconvenience in the service you are coordinating today *sarcastic voice*. While this is happening for us, other customers around us are beginning to notice the lack in service as well. They all are being treated in the Same manner as us. Some have complained to Christopher as well or have decided to leave. After about 45 minutes from the beginning of this whole fiasco, our food finally comes. My wife's food was fine. However, my eggs were undercooked and had a weird taste. I stopped eating them and had my wife taste them. She agreed that they tasted funny. We called for Christopher again. At this point I have lost whatever appetite I had left. He comes back over and we explain to him the issue. AGAIN, he tries to explain away the situation stating \"the server should have asked you if you wanted scrambled eggs soft, hard, etc.\" He then expresses how over the last 4 years he has worked at different establishments and this is the first time this has ever happened under his watch and how shocked he was that this is happening. Good sir, my wife and I ordered the same thing and neither of us specified, beyond just wanting scrambled eggs, how we wanted them. As my wife pointed out, it's not the servers fault for not asking us, it's the cook for not being consistent and management for not properly training the servers. After we made a complaint about the food, several tables around us starting complaining very loudly. The manager is giving all of them the same excuses. We all united in a storm of complaints. He offered us 50% off of our Bill. He then tried to tend to all the other complaints. The server came back one more time to apologize. At this point, My wife and I lost our appetites and just pushed the food away. When the sever brought us our bill and Christopher (the manager) didn't do anything to the bill, we called him back over again. He again gave more excuses with apologies and then finally said he would cover the meal 100%. We gave him some insight as to how we would have liked this experience to have happened and then we left. We will give them another try as this is the first time we have received this kind of poor service, but we won't be returning for a while.

Because I try not to give up so easily on Black business, I went here on 3 different occasions. They EACH left MUCH to be desired. 1) The prices are too high. And for prices you pay, the portions are very underwhelming. Very. My \"grits\" were disgusting. Maybe it was some sort of grits soup that my uncultured ass just doesn't know about, but... No. Wasn't feeling them. The pancakes were not done in the middle. And the bacon was cold and unimpressive. When I told the manager, he was very nonchalant about it. 2) I'm a coffee drinker and if for no other reason, I would visit for the peach coffee. Absolutely amazing. I love it. 3) I had a server named Talilah who was SO awesome that it was a mild distraction from the unimpressive menu. I requested her the times I returned. There was another woman hosting who was amazing as well. Don't know her name though. All that to say... Customer service here (from the staff) is actually awesome. Overall, it's nothing to get excited about. If you live or work in the area, it's a cool lil spot to meet up for Saturday morning coffee or whatever, but other than that? Nah, bruh.

It was so great, I began to reconsider the venue for a dinner I'd host the next weekend for my grandmothers 80th birthday. Our current reservations were for an upscale restaurant in Tinley Park for a party of 15, however after my time here I felt my grandmother would appreciate the food here as a soul food connoisseur; most definitely a further drive from Three Oaks, MI but well worth it or so I thought. This place would not receive 5 stars from me with their current reservation policy. I've patronized an extensive amount of restaurants nationally and internationally as a travel agent. To be told by the restaurant mgr. that we'd have to pay everything up front for reservations without a private setting to say the least was absolutely absurd! I've managed 3 restaurants (all 3 stars and above) and what IS customary is to have the table prepped 30-45mins before group arrival and then to release the seats with group absence 30 minutes after no arrival. I neglected to inform him that I was also a restaurant manager but being argumentative wouldn't have changed either mind at this point. I will say however, to not tell a client what you believe is customary with opinions of unvalidated grandeur because \"we have to be considerate of all of our guests\", as he stated. To ask for nonrefundable money upfront sounds like the pitch at a burger joint, NOT at what I wanted to consider a 4 star place in a sketchy neighborhood; a hidden gem. I WILL be back but as a small party of 2-4. If my math serves me right, this establishment will miss out on an easy $325-350. Revisit your operations plan please.

Like eating a great home-cooked meal, which can have incredible flavor but is not \"overdone.\"Most items on the buffet were *not* spicy, which is refreshing since nowadays it seems every restaurant is trying to blow your doors off with heat too! \u00a0That's not to say there weren't any spicy items but this time I didn't try any of those and I was perfectly happy and felt I had a lot to choose from.One alert is that they have a no-waste policy, so that if you take food you are expected to eat it! \u00a0I've never heard of an all you can eat place telling you this, but I thought this was excellent, as one of the reasons *not* to go to an all you can eat place is the kind of gross, gorging on food you see, and the massive waste, and I think this policy of Pearl's helps with that, because though it was all you can eat, the environment remained decent and tasteful. \u00a0So these things are all great, but as to things that were a little off the ideal mark, I thought the sweet potatoes were just OK as they seemed to have sugar heavily added. These were like eating candy instead of food. In general I don't like a ton of sugar *in* my food. \u00a0Slightly related to sugar in food, there was one issue I had that came to light when I was getting my ribs: \u00a0they told me that when you go up to the counter to get food everything you get needs to be on one plate, and frankly that's fine but I don't like things with a strong sauce, like ribs, mixing with other food items. So the employees had to cheat to give me a small separate bowl for the ribs when I asked. Had they followed the rules, it would have made life harder for me as I would have had to make two visits to the counter to get the ribs on a separate plate. \u00a0And mind you I was only asking for a small amount of ribs. I was not trying to get massive quantities of food; I just wanted a little separation for the ribs. Note the buffet counter has servers and there was usually a small line. So this kind of thing could be annoying, and while in general I understand and even like such a rule, I would say maybe they can make a small exception for foods that involve liquids and a very distinct sauce like ribs, or maybe they just always allow you to get something in one small bowl that is placed onto the plate. \u00a0That seems still in keeping with the rule.One final mention I'd like to give was the rice, which I thought stood out and had a great and somewhat complex flavor and was really, really good. \u00a0I didn't expect the rice to be as good as it was here and this was another demonstration that someone very competent is in the kitchen.On the staff, they were all extremely considerate, and I don't think any thing more needs to be said there. \u00a0They were great.So overall I was very happy to find this gem on the south side and next time I want to see if the lunch buffet is a little better on value, so I hope to update this review soon...", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 9, 28]}, "43": {"description": "The waiter's and service staff were incredibly nice and courteous they exhibited some of the best customer service I have experienced in a long time.

My biggest criticism is the food taste and value-I'm picky about my Italian (as I am ItalIan heritage) and I was really excited to see what the interpretation of my familial cuisine would be.Unfortunately, I found the saltiness of the food offputting. But there was a zest to the diavolo which was good and familiar. The fried ravioli came just thrown on an overly large plate which presentation wise was a little sloppy. The ravioli came smooshed in a small bowl with marinara rather than the advertised vodka sauce. The ravioli were light and delicate but were a bit overwhelmed by the sauce. My companions food was similarly plated and he also noted that everything was a little too heavy on salt.The prices were quite high when you factor in that there is neither bread nor salad included with any entree which is quite unusual in the realm of a restaurant advertising itself as Italian. Nothing was awful, but nothing was memorable enough to warrant the higher end price point.Honestly I truly hate to write a negative review, and some of this may be due to a bad day in the back of the house, the front of the house did a good job and I wouldn't take that away from them.

At that point She got mad and walked away without ANY Apoligizes and then a few minutes later came back and asked us to move so that She could sit a party of 4 because she wanted them to sit together and who had just walked in, mind you we had been there a few hours still spending Money on Beverages and still no food. It was a very nice Place but the Customer service is TERRIBLE and from My understanding the Food is NOT GOOD.I wouldn't know because I never got the chance to eat.I was told that the Calamari was Good.

This establishment has been opened approximately one month. Judge Lyle served a buffet. I asked to speak to the Head Chef who willingly came out and told me that the buffet was comprised of items from the menu. This is what was served: two trays of perfectly prepared not too al dente Penne Pasta, one with Marinara Sauce, and the other with Vodka Sauce--there were also trays of their scrumptious Meatballs and Italian Sausage, enabling you to create your own pasta dish; saut\u00e9ed Tilapia prepared Lemon Piccata style with capers as I recall--fresh & flakey; and Chicken Scarpiello-- saut\u00e9ed chicken breast served in a delectable white wine sauce.

The location is awesome and so is the parking. The decor is very nice. My first visit was for drinks after work and I had a pleasant experience, so when it was suggested to go for dinner I was open to it. (I didn't eat the first time, just mingled). Tonight there was some type of event happening and the majority of the crowd was there for it. Me and my friends were there for dinner and conversation. At one point the host of the event stated speaking to the entire room, so we were not able to talk to each other. \u00a0Since I was not a participant of their program it really ruined our girls night agenda. It would have been better if we were seated off to the side or told upon entering that the party was going to be loud so we could have decided if we wanted to stay. Since I was the last of my party to arrive, everyone had their water already. I asked the server three times for water before I finally got some. I ordered the penne with Italian sausage and diavolo sauce and the zucchini appetizer. Both dishes were mediocre at best. The zucchini was lacking salt/seasoning. The breading was crispy and a little oily and BLAND. The diavolo sauce tasted like prego. It wasn't nasty, but it did not start as fresh tomatoes and garlic and basil. It started in a can/jar. The dish was super basic as well as the plating. I got my food and was done eating before the rest of the food came for the table. When I asked for a to go box, I waited so long I just left the food on the table. Our server was bad. She walked by our table numerous times and had to be asked numerous times for things. I wanted to love this place. I really did. However, I did not. I will not be returning. The food was uber basic and not seasoned and the service was awful.

Instead of giving a play-by-play of events- I'd rather list pros and cons.Pros: 1) They have very reasonable prices. This is a good option if you're on a budget but still want to dine out.2) No parking issue. You should be able to find plenty of parking without having to bend the block numerous times. There's also plenty of parking on residential streets.Cons:1) Limited menu items: Often times when I dine in restaurants with a limited menu- the food is very good and quite memorable. Unfortunately none of the food we ordered was worth a return visit. Suggestion- create a good wine listing insert for your menu. Most Italian restaurants have great wine options to complement the cuisine. I would suggest a minimum of 12-15 strong options, w/ regions ranging from Chile to of course Italy. Also- some Italian dessert options would be great (I.e. gelato, tiramisu, various pastries) and coffee (I.e. cappuccino and espresso) is strongly advised.2) No order: I was very pleased to see a full house when I visited, but was disappointed that we had to stand in the doorway and wait to spot someone to seat us. The waitress they had on duty was not good. The owner of the establishment did a great job in assisting her server. Suggestion- please hire a hostess to meet and greet patrons upon their arrival, coat check if needed, and provide seating. I think 2 servers should be on hand to provide accurate and prompt service. I'd like to see the owner suited and booted, and out on the floor mingling and thanking patrons. Although a real boss has to be ready to roll up their sleeves at any given moment- it would've been nice to see the boss looking like an owner rather than a waitress. Also- don't bother taking reservations. I made an 8:30PM reservation, but it was not referenced when we were finally greeted. I didn't even see a reservation book on hand.3) It's a sports bar: The establishment is a sports bar that features Italian cuisine. If you're looking for fine Italian dining that offers traditional restaurant decor- this is not the place for you. We counted 8 flat screens TV's (one including a 65inch). The bar occupies the bulk of this small establishment. In fact- the first thing our waitress asked was \"what would we like to drink?\" We had to request water half way through our meal.

Food: This also fell pretty flat. The calamari seemed to be the frozen kind. All rings and \"canned\" coating so to speak. Think of the chicken rings from White Castle.

Two weeks prior to see if she could accommodate a party of 30 for a birthday celebration. \u00a0 I live in the neighborhood and was happy to hear that it was a black owned restaurant in the Bronzeville area! \u00a0 Anyhow, Peyryn assured me that all 30 people could come in Friday August 28th at 7pm. \u00a0 I called her the day before to confirm again my party of 30 guest, the owner Peytyn said it was good to go. \u00a0Me and the birthday person showed about about 6:30pm on Friday and none of the staff knew anything about my party of 30. \u00a0So I called Peytyn again to ask her if it was a go and informed her that none of her staff knew of the party of 30 and her reply was that they didn't need to know that she had it all under control. \u00a0 Her manager (her daughter) started to put reserved signs on the available tables. \u00a0It's a small place and I never expected her to lose money or kick anyone out that had sat down before us because I didn't rent the place out, BUT WAS TOLD THAT WE WOULD BE ACCOMMODATED. \u00a0After the tables was set up, we were told that we wouldn't all get out food out at the same time. \u00a0I was fine with that at least some of my guest had food then it would be fine. \u00a0We ordered drinks and bread. \u00a0The bread NEVER came. \u00a0 I hour had passed....we started asking the servers and Peytyn how much longer for our food or at least the bread...we were told that the owner felt that it was more important to just fix our food and had CANCELED the bread, the bread had to be cooked and cut! \u00a0 Wow, nobody took time to inform us that we wasn't getting at least bread on the table with not ONE person had received a plate of food. \u00a0We are still buying drinks but no food. \u00a0No I think the drink tab would have been larger if people had food in their bellies but no food. \u00a0 Peytyn keep coming around asking us we're we ok and people were saying NO they wanted the food. \u00a0THE BLAME was continently shifted to us by telling us we were a party of 30; a big party and they good was coming. \u00a0 2 hours has past now, about 6 plates comes out. \u00a0 Now mind you, other tables were receiving hot food, ate and left and we are still waiting on food. \u00a0The birthday girl was the last person to receive her \u00a0plate after I was totally irritated and told the owner that this was unacceptable. \u00a0 She told me that she never knew it was her bday. \u00a0 No The owner didn't REMEMBER. \u00a0I told her day one, I told the day before when I confirmed, I told her when she arrived additional there were 5 pink happy bday balloons on the table. \u00a0The only excuse that we keep getting was that we were a party of 30. \u00a0SMH, this owner never prepared for a party of 30...the cook didn't know, the servers didn't know and she obviously DID NOT CARE THAT WE SAT FOR almost 2 1/2 hours without food in her place. \u00a0It seems that 4 people could have gotten a plate then 4 more and so on... But that didn't happen. \u00a0It was a horrible experience!! \u00a0I saw that one of my guest also wrote a comment and the owner responded summing it up saying that we should have considered catering our party which was never offered!!! \u00a0 If I was told the TRUTH that they could NOT accommodate a party of 30 we would have went somewhere else. \u00a0I guess she wanted our business but couldn't deliver a level of service that meet her decor! \u00a0 It's pretty as hell in there but that's it! \u00a0I was so out done and disappointed. \u00a0Anybody that know me, know I'm a foodie!! \u00a0This was truly not the place to be. \u00a0 I finally got the shrimp and apparatus that lack seasoning. \u00a0Yes they brought me a drink and yes the paid for the bday girls food. \u00a0But my entire party just hung in there because of the love we had for our bday party and we just wanted to support this black business. \u00a0 She gave a lot of excuses and I really don't think she got it or received anything I said because we didn't talk before I left. \u00a0 She's a sweetheart but I'm praying that she change some things up because she my friends will never be back. \u00a0I heard the salad and the eggplant was the bomb, bartender needs help, BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND LOCATION. \u00a0COME ON PEYTYN lets work on bigger and better. \u00a0 Don't let the spirit of offense offend you, just do better.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 8, 31]}, "15": {"description": "When I Say A MUST TRY .!!!!!

The decor is very nice. My first visit was for drinks after work and I had a pleasant experience, so when it was suggested to go for dinner I was open to it. (I didn't eat the first time, just mingled). Tonight there was some type of event happening and the majority of the crowd was there for it. Me and my friends were there for dinner and conversation. At one point the host of the event stated speaking to the entire room, so we were not able to talk to each other. \u00a0Since I was not a participant of their program it really ruined our girls night agenda. It would have been better if we were seated off to the side or told upon entering that the party was going to be loud so we could have decided if we wanted to stay. Since I was the last of my party to arrive, everyone had their water already. I asked the server three times for water before I finally got some. I ordered the penne with Italian sausage and diavolo sauce and the zucchini appetizer. Both dishes were mediocre at best. The zucchini was lacking salt/seasoning. The breading was crispy and a little oily and BLAND. The diavolo sauce tasted like prego. It wasn't nasty, but it did not start as fresh tomatoes and garlic and basil. It started in a can/jar. The dish was super basic as well as the plating. I got my food and was done eating before the rest of the food came for the table. When I asked for a to go box, I waited so long I just left the food on the table. Our server was bad. She walked by our table numerous times and had to be asked numerous times for things. I wanted to love this place. I really did. However, I did not. I will not be returning. The food was uber basic and not seasoned and the service was awful.

But take the recommendations of other Yelpers and order mixed, or spicy sauce with your choice of the meat. \u00a0The fries are rather generic, but the sauces make them wonderful. The meat is so soft and tender that only the seared parts of it was semi-hard. My order of rib tips had a great woody,smokey flavor and it was topped with (I dunno why, someone explain this) two pieces of white bread.

I've been patronizing Cafe Trinidad for years, since they were in their old location on 75th street, so I thought I knew what to expect from this establishment. Good Lord was I wrong!My bad experience started when I opened the container to the Mac and cheese pie, and to my surprise, there was hardly half of a scoop for the serving size. Cmon yall........you charge almost 5 bucks for a side item like Mac and cheese, and you only give the customer 50 cents worth. I guess I wouldn't have been as upset if the Mac and cheese was any good, but alas it wasn't. The top was thoroughly burnt and overall there was no flavor, let alone cheese. I'm something of an expert on such things so I would rate this Mac and cheese a 3 out of 10. Next was the shrimp roti, which I've had several times from this location, and although it has never been able to hold a candle to something like Teddy's in Washington DC, it was always pretty decent and cheaper than airfare to the nation's capital. I don't know if this place changed owners, cooks, or what... The whole thing was just really subpar. Especially the shrimp! Oh my... They tasted freezer burnt and were the size of sea monkeys. I ended up picking all the shrimp out of the roti they were so bad. I guess what sucks the most is that for the $15 I spent today there are TONS of other options here in Chicago. Even on the south side! JJ Fish would've been a better bet. Geez, probably even McDonald's and I haven't eaten there in a decade.

Sure, I could go to Chinatown, but what I really want is cheap and tasty food from a hole in the wall kind of place. The Yelp reviews I read were unsettling but my roommates had ordered from here before and their food looked good so my friend and I got their lunch specials. I got Kung Pao Chicken, an eggroll, chicken fried rice (+0.50), and a soda for $5.50He got the same order except with Sesame Chicken. We also got Chow Mein (oddly GrubHub didn't have Lo Mein) and a bag of 12 fortune cookies ($1.15). We placed the order around 11:40 on a Thursday and the food came around 12:50, which was a long time, but within the time period they predicted. The food was really f*cking delicious. There was actually a lot more food included that you usually get with lunch specials. The fried rice was really tasty and there was a lot of it. The eggrolls were also amazing. My Kung Pao chicken was packed with celery (a little too much in my opinion) but there were also tons of peanuts and baby corns. The flavor was great - enough chili peppers that my mouth and lips were tingly but not overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was also good and I didn't have the problems with gristle or toughness that other reviewers did. My friend's sesame chicken came covered in sesame seeds but the flavor was really good and there was a lot of chicken - also all well cooked. We were so full that we didn't try the Chow Mein. Basically, the delivery is a little slow but the portions are generous, the prices are really good, and the food that we got was very tasty. We're definitely ordering from there again.

However, if you do happen to stumble upon the originator, you're treated to some of the greatest fried chicken that walked the G's green earth.Chicago's finest, or at least most-well known, Harold's Chicken Shack, has been far more prolific than Frenchy's, but perhaps it falls under the same purview. I'm not even sure where the original Harold's sits, but it's most assuredly not this South Loop location (one of two in the Sloop, in fact).As such, the fried chicken at Harold's on Wabash is decidedly average. The chicken, particularly the thigh, runs on the small side, and the crisp decidedly lacks flavor. A chicken dinner comes standard with fries, seasoned decently, and a very delicious hot sauce. If taking to go, hot sauce is most definitely recommended on the side, as it quickly permeates the chicken skin and will render it soggy. A small side of cole slaw and some white bread recalls a fun visit to Raising Cane's.All in all, I just really miss Frenchy's.

It came out \u00a0to about $8.65 +\\-. I ordered the mild sauce everyone keeps posting about. People have raved about the sauce being this or that. Many have went on and on talking about \"wonder what's in that secret sauce...\" \u00a0Hey wise guy!! From what I can tell, that \"secret sauce\" was nothing more than ketchup with hot sauce in it. Wtf?! Worse: The wings were not fresh at all and were fried over and over and over again. The fries were average and nothing to get excited about.

a long morning run followed by a drive to the south side just as the sun was rising to visit a bakery, this time one called Abundance - a tiny storefront that even with my GPS I drove right past before realizing my error and a place that was surprisingly unheard of by every single one of my local epicurean friends despite its 20+ year history turning out baked goods, sandwiches, soups, and beverages six days a week.Originally pointed to Abundance by a blog while doing my research on Old Fashioned Donuts my arrival to the small shop would again find me in a less than ideal area but unlike my first destination this one was devoid of customers save for myself. \u00a0Entering the small shop to the familiar smell of baked goods a set of jingle bells on the door seemed to startle the elderly gentleman behind the counter who was arranging fresh baked donuts and with a big smile he introduced himself as Bill and welcomed me to 'his' store - something I would have figured out shortly as there we newspaper clippings featuring his face and his goods decorating the small amount of available wall space not consumed by the pastry cases. \u00a0A pleasant man who seemed quite interested in why I had a camera and more so how I'd heard about his store we spent a few minutes chatting before he asked me \"so, what can I get ya?\" and deferring to his recommendations plus a few personal favorites I emerged from the small shop with five items weighing well over a pound for less than $10.With each item save for one still hot from the oven my tasting would start with the two lightest choices in a pair of yeast raised donuts, one simply glazed and the other chocolate, and much like those from Old Fashioned these were exactly what you would expect from an old-school bakery with a good rise, sugary frosting, and yeasty notes punctuated by a bit of butter. \u00a0It isn't reinventing the when and it isn't trying to.Moving next to a dish heavily promoted by a few bloggers as well as by Bill himself, much like Old Fashioned Donuts, Abundance serves a pretty damned big Apple Fritter and while Bill wouldn't say it when I jokingly asked (\"they're different\") I'll tell you right now that I actually preferred the version at Abundance, a half-skateboard length oblong disc chock-full of soft apple chunks and teaming with cinnamon. \u00a0Served hot but with the lacquer of glaze well set over the golden pastry and heavy without being oily I'd be lying if I didn't admit that this was even a lot of sugar and fat for my gluttonous vacationing self, but with a nearly six hour drive home it was gone before I hit the Ohio border - and leading to a lovely sugar-crash induced nap perhaps thirty minutes after I walked through my door.Having mentioned five items, another warm indulgence that I ate half of while standing outside the bakery (saving the rest for a post-nap dinner) was the Walnut Apple Bread Pudding, a dense concoction that Bill told me is soaked for nearly 12 hours before being baked in the morning and falling somewhere between pound cake, bread pudding, and a sort of pull-apart quick bread I will simply note that while there was nothing 'designer' about this item it was quite perfect in a rustic way - the sort of bread pudding you could just as easily make at home but never do...and probably for the best as (if you're anything like me) you'd end up eating the whole pan within 48 hours. \u00a0With the first four selections sufficiently sweet and uniformly good-to-great, my final selection from Abundance very well may have been the most memorable take-out pastry of the trip; an item titled \"Upside down Caramel Cupcake\" that came in a plastic clamshell container with a spoon - and for good reason as this was most certainly not your average cupcake. \u00a0Beginning first with the upside down presentation, my best guess for this delivery was to prevent the cake from tipping over and to facilitate easy application of the glaze, a thick homemade melted caramel that was as buttery as it was sweet and just saline enough to keep it from being overwhelming. \u00a0Moving next to the cake itself, again atypical for a cupcake and all the better for it, imagine a dense pound cake with even more butter...or for those who've been to Maestro's Steakhouse simply imagine their buttercake served chilled with caramel instead of warm with ice cream - it was good enough that if you really wanted to call it a cupcake it would rank in my top five all time and when placed in the context of everything else at Abundance it really makes me wonder why the tiny shop doesn't get more attention because as a complete package inclusive of customer service, selection, price, and execution Abundance is an absolute diamond in the rough.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 5, 3]}, "5": {"description": "South-side bakeries know how to make an apple fritter. \u00a0What is in the water down there?? \u00a0I can't explain why Abundance Bakery takes #2 on the apple fritter list right behind Old Fashioned Donuts, but whatever they are doing, they should keep it a secret!The Abundance apple fritter boasts every quality that you could want--plus nuts! \u00a0I think pecans but I'm not sure. \u00a0Anyway, this is really close to a perfect apple fritter--slightly crispy exterior, pillowy soft interior, the perfect level of sweetness, a generous sprinkling of cinnamon, and enough apple chunks to land in every bite. \u00a0Plus the one that I got on Saturday morning was still warm! \u00a0Triphena W. is right: \"you just tear into this stuff in your car.\" \u00a0Mine was gone by the time I got home.It's a small shop, but they sell a lot of great doughnuts (in the cases) and many other baked goods (on the menu but not out for display when I was there). \u00a0Their yeast-raised glazed was wonderful, as was the chocolate-and-coconut-covered cake doughnut. \u00a0I thought that the icing on the yeast-raised chocolate-iced lacked chocolate flavor, but it was still a solid doughnut.And besides baking supremely tasty treats, the people are very nice.If you are ever making a Chicago Apple Fritter Tour (this is common, right?), Abundance absolutely MUST be a stop.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 4, 6]}, "31": {"description": "Fresh, amazing donuts with NO wait in line!

Just happened that a few other funny comedians from ha ha ladies of late night show were also in attendance at this show and did a naughtier, lewd and rude routine which was very funny. (Strange how location of a club and demographic changes the content of the comedy, a little.) I loved every part of the show except for the customer participation part of it. And they have creative ways of getting people onto their stage; you can win prizes and some have a monetary value. It's an interesting show and at the end a few of the comedy clubs' usual comedians may come on stage and do a short stand up performance. The night we checked it out we got to see at least three different guys perform, one that stood out had a name like \"Crazy Fool\" He was indeed a crazy fool, his comedy was out there and it was riotous. Can't remember the details on cost; but if you check out the website and see details on the comedians and if they have websites you may be able to score a BOGO coupon somehow. All shows have a two drink minimum which is a constant at most comedy clubs. They have nightly alcohol specials which can be seen via the website but it's better to call in (Best to call on the night of a show or at night, I've tried calling during the day and gotten no response). Street parking is available around the club, but, I would suggest valet. Wouldn't suggest taking public transportation to the club unless you are truly street savvy or it's an early show. The neighborhood surrounding is not lively or populated and you can be approached by all kinds of characters you really wouldn't want to be caught in a situation with. I don't recall seeing an ATM in the club and the nearest ones are closer to the exits off LSD. Looks as though they recently updated their website, which was a much needed upgrade. When the show ends you have the opportunity to meet and greet with any one of the comedians and most are good about talking with you or taking photos, autographs, etc. I would suggest going with a group of people which can equal a great time and save you from having to participate. Another reviewer went into detail about costs. Any person that has checked out comedy anywhere in Chicago knows that all clubs carry costs. This club is no more expensive than say the Improv Chicago where ticket cost, food and alcohol can easily run a pair close to a Benjamin. You want to save money on ticket cost? Get your ass on-line and do your homework. Avoid cocktails and stick with house wine or beer; there are always specials. Ladies use them big-ass purses for some good and smuggle in airplane bottles.

I was unaware of the automatic 18% gratuity(just read this in another review...)---had I noticed it I wouldn't have paid a cash tip in addition. I had places that force you to tip a certain amount. Here is a tip: if you provide more VALUE to your consumers you won't have to have mandatory drink minimums or automatic gratuities. If you have 2 people sitting at one table and they each get a separate check (which happened when I went and sat next to someone I didn't know)the server will get a 36% gratuity- plus the cash tips, as most people prob don't notice or read the automatic gratuity...

Now, I had read all the reviews here before going and I was perfectly okay with the 2 drink minimun and the $15/per person cover. I work and my husband work, so we can certainly \"afford\" that. BUT, if you are going with a large group, look for the coupon that is supposedly on their website. On our way in, a woman walked in with a \"coupon\" that she had gotten from the website that I certainly wasn't aware of. She said that she paid $20.00 in advance and she and nine people could get in for free - they only had to honor the two drink minimum. Whoooah. So, they each paid $2.00 to get in! Get this, most of her party did not show up. \u00a0Now, my real issue is that the drinks were served in 4oz or less martini glasses and were $7.50 - $8.00 each. Now that was certainly a slap in the face. After spending $30.00 to get in the club and then being forced to buy two drinks, you would at least think the club would make it worth your while. 4 oz glasses...!!! \u00a0We could not believe the drinks were served in MINI drink glasses and they weren't great drinks. The martini glasses were the tiniest I'd ever seen. Then to add insult to injury, the lady sitting behind me had a \"normal\" size glass, I asked what she was drinking and she said she had ordered from the menu...duhh!? How could I have known that? That just doesn't seem like a fair business practice to me. Finally, I absolutely loved the host, the big bald dude ;-). He was hilarious. The headliner went way too long, and it wasn't until late in his performance that he actually warmed up and got funny. The other comedians who were hilarious weren't given ENOUGH time. At the end of the day, I would probably not return to this venue unless I got the coupon and paid $2.00 to get in and had nothing else to do.

The jerk chicken my boyfriend had was excellent as he's a big fan. I had the curry goat and it was disappointing. This is my 2nd time ordering the curry goat and both times I got WAY more skin and bones than I actually did goat meat; literally about 3 pieces of actual meat -- no joke. \u00a0Also, all 3 times that I've been there, they're ALWAYS out of something!!! This is so aggravating when you're supposed to be a full service/dining establishment of caribbean food! Twice they didn't have beef patties -- what caribbean place doesn't have beef patties?!? Then they were either out of the certain cakes they displayed in their menus or didn't have a particular type of seafood that evening/day. Because of this, I was deterred to hold a party here although I was thinking that if planned ahead of time, it'd work out.

The consistency of the cheese was clunky and the pasta was soggy. I was left with one side to eat with my chicken. The bread that comes long with the meal was OK and very soft.

I heard a lot of about the Humboldt Park location prior to the new location opening in Bronzeville. After reading about it in the Chicago Reader recently I couldn't wait to try it. Now that I've finally eaten there I'd say it was worth the wait.My mom happened to be visiting me so I sent her to Honey 1 for us. She ordered the rib tip/hot link combo while I opted for the smaller order of the hot link sandwich. My mom said she told the gentleman that she wanted the food mild but I'm not sure that's what we got as it was VERY hot. I'm talking nose running, eyes running, guzzling down water hot. IF that's Honey 1s version of 'mild' then I shutter to even imagine what the actual 'hot' version tastes like. My mom thought her food was entirely too hot and didn't enjoy it as much as she might have had it not too be spicy. First impression, the portion I got of links and fries was small. Just one link and a very small amount of fries. I didn't see the receipt but I'm guessing I got the lunch portion of the link sandwich. The order was small but very filling. I wasn't hungry after I hate it and didn't wish I'd ordered more food. I still think they are a bit stingy on the fries though. The other thing I didn't like was that the fries were separated from the links and bbq sauce. And there wasn't enough bbq sauce to coat or dip the fries in so I had to use ketchup. I like ketchup but eating it when the fries should be smothered in bbq sauce is sinful. I saw on the menu that you have to pay extra for additional bbq sauce. That will be a must the next time around. Overall though the food was good. I enjoyed it and would definitely go back and recommend it.My mom agreed even though the food was a bit too spicy for her. Since she ordered the combo she got a much larger portion than I did and had enough leftovers to save for the next day. She liked the link as well but said she wasn't blown away by it. She said the rib tips were much better but would have like a larger portion of fries as well. There was much more bbq sauce on her order than mine. Her meal also came with two pieces of white bread.The bill came to about $15 for the two orders. My mom said the young gentleman was really nice (named Robert) and she joked that she should have asked him if he was single! LOL She went on and on about how cute he was and how he had beautiful eyes. :) \u00a0Hey, I suppose being easy on the eyes doesn't hurt a business!! Just one more reason for me to stop in and try something different the next time I'm craving bbq.IMHO, it takes courage to close a thriving business on the north side and move it south.

I just don't understand the wrinkled appearance and soggy texture, so pardon me, I'm trying to make sense of it all...H Dog- Totally my fault.

The turkey in this chilli happened to be cooked the way that I hate. The chilli itself also lacks flavor and is too watery to be placed atop of a hot dog, so the bun disintegrates into a gloppy mess. Bronzeville Belly Buster- The burger seems frozen. It seemed like a patty you could get at any Jewel or Save A Lot, which would have been fine if it had any flavor. Just an over sized unappetizing burger.Truffle fries- Despite our 30 minute wait in a completely empty restaurant on a Friday night- for hotdogs and a burger, we still managed to get cold, stale, bitter tasting fries. I live literally 1 minute away. There is no way my fries should have been ice cold. The fries tasted like they had been cooked hours before. They were so hard.

Long story short, it took a couple of huddles between the cashier, the cook, and two other people before they decided to give me another piece of chicken.

Dinner is probably the best time of day to come, as I can't imagine anyone would be able to be productive after indulging in this finger-licking experience in Hedonism.Sauce: Most all of their food comes with sauce over it, so you will have to declare your allegiance (or specify your means of death).

At worst, it can be described as a necessary trial to prove your desperation--oh the wait, the agonizing, excruciating wait! At best, it's a mundane ten-or-so minutes (YMMV, depending on how large and how strange your order is) to endure. However, there is some comic relief in the game of telephone that inevitably occurs. To elaborate: the game begins when the servicepeople behind the bullet-proof glass yell out what to me appears to be a randomly-generated IID number. Then, the customers waiting in line will begrudgingly check their own receipts (to their dismay). It proceeds as they look around and see if anyone else was lucky enough to win the jackpot (incidentally, there is a small lotto shop attached to this Harolds, but I think it's a different enterprise on its own), and if not, someone will yell out a DIFFERENT number, perhaps out of spite, genuine concern but hard of hearing, or a part of the usual necessary bedlam in the process (nobody knows). Upon hearing their number finally being called out, someone will happily rush over, only to find that it was 108 and not 92, to everyone's dismay, and the game begins again.

One boy blocked the cashier into the register area joking \"I'm not letting you out until you run this credit card.\" They laughed and horse played - all while I patiently waited for my order. To see employees joke around so blatantly when I'm still waiting for my order was frustrating.

Additionally, I will never know how good their Peach Cobbler is because they never have this item. This is my third attempt at carry out within the past 3 years.

I literally live right across the street and this time I decided to try a different approach to ordering my food. In the past, I have ordered via telephone or in person and experienced delays in receiving my order in upwards of an hour or more. With each experience I have been told that they have ran out of the requested sides. I am cracking up because I have only ordered sides, and I fail to see the difficulty in maintaining staples.This go around I ordered and paid for my 2 sides online. I purposefully waited 30 minutes before going across the street to pick up my order. When I get there I am told that there is a 2 hour wait because one of my sides is in the oven. The cashier asked me if I wanted to wait.Huh???? She then had difficulty figuring out that I had pre-paid because I placed the order online. I requested a refund due to the 2 hour delay and was initially told that they could not refund my money. As a result they asked me several time if I wanted a substitute for my order. NO. Then after some persistence I was told that my money had been refunded and that I needed to take his word because they could not issue a receipt. \u00a0A small decently dress guy then handed me the remaining sided item. When I requested a bag, his reply was that he thought I was being eco-friendly. While I presumed that he was making a joke I had failed to see the humor given they had now already sucked 35 minutes of my time for 1 side order. \u00a0I asked multiple times for the manager on duty. \u00a0Finally, I was acknowledged by the manager but \"I\" had to politely ask him to share his name. I shared with him my previous experiences, however he never asked me my name nor did he seem interested that I am a neighborhood customer After my inquiry he shared that he was the owner's cousin who is in training to manage the soon to be open restaurant in Cleveland. smh.

Super annoying.. my fault for not checking 3 times, but this place used to be so on point. Also, the last time I went there to dine in, my food was cold. No one wants to eat a cold waffle. They were super busy, so I didn't want to be difficult so I just ate it, but like really? Ok... my mac and cheese was soggy and my yams weren't mashed. So, I think I am going to take a solid break from here. I kept coming back just hoping the restaurant was having some off days, but it looks like they've gone downhill. So with that being said, I will not be bringing my guests here anymore :(", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 9, 22]}, "52": {"description": "Worst service of my life.

She gave me the total and I informed her I will come pick up at 530pm. When I arrived at 535pm my order was not ready and I had 10 hungry family member at my home waiting for food. I was furious! Not only was I angry at the point that I was told my order would be ready but I was also furious that the manger refused to come and address his customer. When he finally waddled his fat butt out of the back he began to argue with me and tell me I need to pay ahead of time and it would be an hour before he could have my order ready. Not only was he rude but when I looked in the smoker where was NO FOOD! I assume he was going to have to cook my order. Anyone who has ever bbq'd knows it will take more than an hour to do so. I stormed out and went to UNCLE JOHNS ON 83RD. When I got to 83rd I was met with a smile and with compassion when I told her my story and that I have 10 family members waiting. She simple said \"give me 15 minutes\" in around 30 minutes I walked out with tons of food and I was very happy! Uncle Johns on 83rd was glad to accept my 120.00 and I was more than delighted to give it to them. UNCLE JOHN'S ON 83RD AND COTTAGE SAVED THE DAY!I will never return to Uncle J's on 47th and will tell everyone I know NEVER to spend their money there.

She seemed very professional and genuine.When I came in for my first appointment 4 weeks later, I thought Zaki really did a fantastic job on my hair.The next time I came in, which was 8 weeks later, Zaki charged me $135 dollars. It went up to $125 for the service and $10 for the style. At no point did she contact me and tell me she went up on her prices. It is very unclear at this place if the stylist are independent or they work on their own. I was given a price and she just went up on me. There is no price list, there is no website that you can refer to look at prices. It seems as though someone can just go up because they feel like it. Anyway, I paid her $135 for the service, I should have said something about the price hike at the time but I didn't. I felt she did a really good job and I honestly didn't mind paying her that much even though she was extremely unprofessional and went up on the price like that.The next time I came in, 8 weeks later, Zaki charged me $145 for the same exact service she had provided the previous two times. This time she added another $10 for prunning, which she had done previous with no extra charge. I had spoken to Zaki about my experiences with other stylist and the horrible service. She told me she worked at Amazon salon before and how they would nickel and dime people on any little extra thing. She told me she just charged a flat rate for her services. Which proved to be untrue. Anyway, once again I paid her $145 after the service was over. This time not only did I get charged more, but I waited over an hour before she even started on me, so by the time she finished I had somewhere I needed to be. I paid and rushed out. The next day I called Zaki because I was furious at her continuous price hike. I went down the line and asked her why is it that every time I come in she charges me a different price? She really had no answer for me. She did say that she does a good job on my hair and at the price Lenny charges, she felt she should charge more because she does a neater job and uses products. I'm thinking to myself \"shouldn't you and Lenny have worked that out before I came for my consultation?\" Shouldn't you do a good job anyway. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The price I was given was $95 and this is the price you agreed to do it at in the beginning. She told me how she went up on her prices and she never notified me by email, phone call, or text. Zaki is extremely unprofessional. She does a fabulous job on your hair, I'll admit that. She really does a good job, but she treats it like a hustle instead of a profession. It's about getting over on you for that extra $10 or $20 dollars. I was tipping Zaki, I was even in the process of referring other business to her and she was just very shady. I have clients in my business and I would never treat people like that. Anyway, I expressed to her how I felt about her shady business practices, I was professional with her in expressing that. But I had not planned on going back. A week later she called and apologized for everything and stated that she would do my hair for $95, even though she felt she was worth more. We went through what would be included in the service. She told me general maintenance, wash, prunning. I thought it was great that she did call and apologize, so I agreed to come back.The last and final time, I get there for my appointment and I wait for 45 minutes. She had not gotten to the shop. I live pretty much in Evanston and she lives in the neighborhood and I have to wait 45 minutes.......but ok, I think this is the $95 service :). She did my hair quicker than she had ever done it before. I think I was out of there in less than 2 hours. I would usually be in there for close to four. It was clear she was not excited to do my hair. She finished, looked me in the face and told me she prunned my hair, when she didn't. I knew I would never come back. I wrote her an email and let her know how unprofessional she was and if she didn't want to do my hair for $95, she shouldn't have offered.I can only speak for my experience here. There truly needs to be a price list or a website to refer to. It's very unclear whether stylist are independent or work for the salon.

We watched a group of women dance in too little clothes, get tossed in the air, and all sorts of rachetness but when my BFF decides to 2 step with her boyfriend on his birthday security says dancing is not allowed. Prior to that it took an hour for our entire party to get in the place where we paid for two tables \u00a0(tables are just when you order bottle service) and we were told they wouldn't be let in until a third bottle was ordered. The bottle service isn't worth it and didn't make me feel VIP with dirty glasses. Not to mention people were sitting at our reserved tables when we arrived and the employees acted as if they were scared to ask them to move so we did it ourselves. \u00a02.) The food sucks and the things they offer that are ok to eat are never in stock. By the time you get your food its cold. I've been to plenty of bars in chicago that have great food I don't know what swagger's excuse is. Oh and they always run out of cups which makes the wait for another drink take longer. 3.) The waitresses suck. You can hear them complain about what people they don't want to serve because they use your appearance to judge whether or not you will tip well or not. They don't check on you and you have to look for them. My waitress knew the birthday boy but that didn't make her give any better service.NEVER EVER EVER EVER APPLY FOR A JOB AT THIS PLACE!!!Every fucking two weeks I get to hear employees of this place say oh i wonder if I'm going to get paid on time. Most recently there was no paycheck on payday. The manager sucks and tells the employees he knows nothing about it and doesn't care. Meanwhile no one contacts the employees to say hey I'm sorry your check is late and will be here on this day at this time. Oh and they're so broke they finally give up checks on a Saturday night when banks are closed and won't be open until Monday morning. \"cash your check on tuesday\" Well its tuesday and the check bounced!

I remember when Blu 47 was at its prime.Well enough preamble. On to Swagger. \u00a0Another friend who has been in Chicago on a project this year, a friend who lives in the neighborhood near Swagger and I decided to check it out after attending a Crown Royal event. \u00a0My Chicago friend told us that she had been once and that it \u00a0seemed to be a nice new venue to add to her local haunts. \u00a0Upon going in, we liked the decor. \u00a0The set up was cozy and the multiple rooms were cool. \u00a0It felt like you were in someone's house. \u00a0It wasn't filled with wall to wall people, but with an NBA finals game on there were few seats available. \u00a0We finally went into a room that was like a \"living room\" with chairs and tables and chairs lining the wall.My issues with Swagger primarily had to do with service (or lack of service). The waitress who seemed to be working the entire room by herself also looked like she was younger than Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas. I don't know if it was her first service job, if she is family to the owners or what the deal was, but we waited almost 20 minutes before, after calling her attention, we had any opportunity to order anything. \u00a0Even then she wanted us to wait. \u00a0My one friend just wanted an order of fries. \u00a0That order of fries took almost 30 minutes to come out. Meanwhile, as I said, the place wasn't packed. \u00a0A woman at a neighboring table advised us to either flag down another waitress to order drinks or go to the bar. \u00a0I went to the bar. \u00a0There was one bartender working so I had to wait a bit for a drink. \u00a0I came back with the drink and my friend still didn't have her fries. \u00a0By the time the fries came for my friend...they were somewhat cold and she delivered them without ketchup or a napkin. \u00a0She never came to check on us and my friend scavenged her own ketchup from other tables (one bottle was empty). \u00a0In the end my friend had to track the server down again as she never brought a bill. \u00a0She and another worker looked confused as she told them she wouldn't be paying for cold fries that took 30 minutes to come out, without ketchup or a napkin.Service has to be tops in a new establishment or people won't come back. As nice as this place is from a layout perspective (the patio looked really cool) I can see it being closed or the clientele going downhill quick if the standards and staff promptness/attentiveness don't change. \u00a0The only way I'd be pressed to give this place another chance is if my friend who lives in the neighborhood says the service has improved. \u00a0Based on her updates from other friends and colleagues it still seems like the establishment has not found its customer service swagger.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 8, 4]}, "10": {"description": "I was there this Saturday for a birthday party and it was very nice.
