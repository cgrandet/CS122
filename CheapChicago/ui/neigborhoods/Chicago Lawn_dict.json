That was what had my coworker and myself had been doing for most of the morning. We had been fueled by the vision of the tacos we would eat after our third home visit, and Tacos Villa was fulfilled our fungus-influenced expectations. Though the small restaurant was a little toasty on the hot afternoon, we were comfortable on a bar stools watching our orders take place eyes watering and noses itching. Sometimes, you just need to zone out watching a guy use a masa press and look at a map about the breweries of Mexico. I ordered a chicken sope, rice and beans, and an horchata. The Horchata was thin, cold, not too sweet, and really cinnamon-y, the signs of an excellent horchata. The yellow rice and refried beans were served in a little boat-shaped dish. These were so much better than so many rice and beans I have eaten so many times- perfectly cooked and slightly garlic-y, they stood on their own, enhanced by the vinegary-green and funky-red salsa that came on the side, but not needing that accompaniment. My chicken sope was a delicately arranged tower. I usually avoid sopes because they are messy and sometimes the tortilla-base-thing sucks, but this was the opposite of that. The deep-fried base was crispy, delicate- Hugh's S. Description of \"biscuit\" is not off the mark. The pollo top came in big, lean pieces, well marinated and cooked. Sometimes, ordering pollo is asking for shredded skin and fat with zero percent seasoning, but this chicken was had a flavor somewhere between curry and mole- a perfect contrast to the crunch of the biscuit and lettuce. A Note! They do not have chips or avocado. \u00a0If these are food items are requirements for you, you need to expand your palate but you're not going to be happy here.  \u00a0As I look back on my recent visit to Tacos Villa, I am filled with kindheartedness and a sense of nostalgia.

They also have those weird corn flat wares, which are totally better for the environment, but are thick and feel weird. Star Fruit also has these weird wares. The strangest thing about them is that I can bite a hole in them! If they're so easily torn apart, they must be super-biodegradable. But I can't get used to them. I'd rather just try to reuse plastic ware to be envi-friendly (or not use such transient wares at all). So strange saucy food with weird wares makes my mouth not so satisfied with a loop lunch.The structure for ordering is also odd. Why must I write everything on a half sheet of paper? I am a simple gal - if you put something on a menu, I will point to it and say, 'one of those please.' Now, I appreciate the effort to make everyone feel like an individual and get the chance to write down exactly what they want, but if I don't plan on getting specific then why must I waste paper?I'm trying to imagine myself as a regular here...I just can't.", "rating": "2", "date": [2009, 8, 27]}, "8": {"description": "Not going back, sorry.

Then they add a little pre-chopped chicken breast -- none of that fatty, juicy delicious pan fried goodness .... whoops! Healthy ... we're thinking healthy. Badness, fatty, juicy delicious pan fried badness. And then they add bean sprouts, carrots and broccoli. The carrots and broccoli are either raw or blanched, so they retain most of their nutrients.

\u00a0A look online and I discovered that while the facade is an organic, healthy, vegan-friendly, brown-rice-pushin', tofu-fartin' foodatorium - they somehow still left me with the power to make something awesome...So I put my reviewing pants on and sacrificed half of my 30-minute lunch break to make it over there and order and head back to the office to chow down. \u00a0I stepped into that familiar nightmare and reached for a clipboard. \u00a0I eventually found the basket of golf pencils and started the crafting of my lunch.Step 1: Select Your MealThe wraps and bowls were out, because of the brown rice factor. \u00a0The soup seemed like an interesting concept, but I was in work attire and am prone to soup-related spills and dribbles so that was out. \u00a0And so I was faced with my mortal nemesis: the Salad.Romaine itself is too bland. \u00a0Spinach by itself is too gross. \u00a0I went with the \"Freshii Mix\" - which it turns out is more than just romaine and spinach (I learned later I could have just checked both boxes instead, but the Mix wasn't bad).Step 2: Unlimited ToppingsNow THIS is a lunchtime option I can be down with. \u00a0Unfortunately, the selection is void of most of the really GOOD items I like in a salad - they're in the Premium section. \u00a0Also, while the Premium section offers the choice of \"double\", the Unlimited section does not. \u00a0I went with Broccoli, Crispy Wonton, Egg Whites, House Croutons, Mushrooms and Red Onions. \u00a0I pondered getting Sliced Eggs as well, but the whites are my favorite part, so I was set.Step 3: Premium ToppingsHere's where they get you. \u00a0They gave you a bland base of greens and you're already at $5.95. \u00a0The unlimited toppings are freebies, but nothing spectacular about them (and you can't double). \u00a0I understand that proteins are where the real flavor and filling comes from, so I went the route of Buffalo Chicken for $2.00 extra. \u00a0And then I \"doubled\" it for another $1.25 extra.Step 4: Choose Your FlavorI'm still trying to understand Freshii's categorizations of \"24/7\", \"Balance\" and \"Splurge\". \u00a0I guess the first is good \"any time\", the second is for \"trying to be healthy\" and the third is for \"not trying to be healthy\". \u00a0So it's pretty obvious I splurged and went with the regular Ranch dressing (not the Lite version). \u00a0I appreciated their additional option of \"half\", \"regular\", \"heavy\" and \"on the side\" - especially since the \"heavy\" option I chose doesn't cost any more than \"half\".Name at the top and gave it to the guy, who handed me the carbon copy and I took that to the register to pay. \u00a0And yea, for a salad this awesome, the damage was about $10 - but I can at least say that it was worth it. \u00a0It's almost two meals, and I'm a guy who can handle a lot of food.The croutons are gigantic, the dressing managed to cover everything I needed at the \"heavy\" setting, and I felt like they actually gave me \"double\" on the buffalo chicken which paired splendidly with the Ranch dressing.I'd love to give this place a bad review. \u00a0I love knocking down the hippy-dippy health-food craziness places. \u00a0But they let me get something as unhealthy as I could create it. \u00a0I'm still not going to give them anything higher than 3 stars because the brown rice factor eliminated half the menu right off the bat. \u00a0Freshii, I understand that you want me to eat healthy - but if you'll let me splurge on fatty dressing and chocolate chips on the frozen yogurt you sell, why can't I splurge and get plain white rice or something just as filling but TASTY like refried beans or fried rice or chocolate?This place apparently isn't as scary as it looks from the outside with walls of clipboards and a creepy-looking metal sculpture holding chips and organic candies. \u00a0Unless you're afraid of brown rice, whole grains and vegetables...", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 7, 31]}, "40": {"description": "Since nothing else was open in the loop at 7:00pm, I stopped in here to get a salad.

Easy breezy. When I arrived, all I had to do was grab my bagged wrap as I had already paid for it as well. Good thing, because my little jaunt took much longer than expected due to *sniff* public transpo. And my cheap lunch would've been marred by taking a cab (i.e. $7 wrap + $14 roundtrip car fare. Methinks not). Back to my wrap. Fresh natural chicken, crispy romaine, celery, red onions, goat cheese and a smattering of cucumber dill dressing in a whole wheat wrap. That particular dressing is lo-cal and legitimately awesome (this from someone who despises fat-free foodstuffs). My wrap was healthy according to the online nutrition calculator, filling to my tummy AND delicious as reported by my taste buds. Yes, thanks to Freshii the impossible dream is indeed possible.

I had been going to Classic Touch for over 8 years and the sisters always did a fabulous job whether it was the cut, the style or the color. Up until recently I have not been too happy with them. I only get my hair done with the two sisters and no one else and they both should have known this detail about me for being such a repeat customer. In November 2013 I decided to go ombre - Araceli had done such a fabulous job with it! When I returned in January for a touch up, her sister, Alicia, did the touch up. After having the dye washed out of my hair, the end result was my hair being dyed a platinum blonde. I dont know how often you see platinum blonde ombre on someone's head, but that is not how I wanted it or how I had it the first time - I had a more subtle blonde. I literally was about to cry because now the color was not what I wanted, but also my hair was fried to the max! Alicia decided in order to bring down the color she needed to put some toner... end result - my hair turned silver and purple. I wanted to cry. How was I going to go to school or to my internship with purple hair. Luckily after a few washes the ends became a darker blonde. However my ends were fried to the point where I could not leave my hair down - it looked like straw. Months later I was done with the ombre and decided to go back brunette. Araceli said that I should go darker than my natural hair to get the blonde out. I thought \"Okay, she'll do it and it'll look fab like all the times before\". NOPE. Because she was sooo busy with another client here ASSISTANT dyed my hair. LET ME REMIND YOU THAT I NEVER LET ANYONE ELSE BESIDES THE SISTERS DO MY CUT/STYLE/OR DYE. The assistant covered my hair in black ... missing spots along the way. I did not know that my hair was not fully covered until I got home and was told. My issue was with the sisters - they did not take care of my hair the way I thought they would. I gotten my hair straightened by Alicia and she never once thought to let me know that the assistant missed parts of my hair. How unprofessional is that?

Little did I know, I'd wash my hair and the red would bleed into the blonde making me look like Carrot Top's sister. This was beyond a hot mess! I called and let them know what the situation was and Araceli, the shop manager assured me she would fix it. I went in and again the same stylist took care of me. I asked her to get rid of the red, and so she began. Turns out she just toned it down. Again, not what I asked for. Notice any patterns? Anyways, third is sorta the charm because I was fed up and just wanted it all gone. She covered it with a half effort job because now I have random patches of red, and burgundy over my natural color. As if this wasn't enough, all through out this return visit, Angelica was passive- aggressive. Smiling at me but snickering on the side, and very hard on my head, pulling and tugging at my hair as she \"fixed\" it. After this experience, it is needless to say that I will not be returning.

This comes with rice, salad, garlic bread and fries.After eating all that food I wished there was more pina rellena, not because I was still hungry, or the portion (portions are huge) but because that is one of those addicting flavors that you can't stop eating (or at least I). \u00a0Yeap it was that good.Can't wait to come back on a week end.

If you enjoy caribbean-style cuisine, you will definitely enjoy the Traditional Belizean stewed chicken which is perfection in a bowl. It had a reddish color due to Recado (also known as \"Achiote\"), which is a commonly known spice in Belize. It is known for providing an amalgamation of slightly sweet and peppery flavors to stews, fish, chicken, beef, soups and sauces. It is the \"Holy Grail\" of spices in Belize. The food here is truly hearty, delectable, bright, bold and ethereal. I had the chicken stew ($5.95), and opted for the rice and beans which is a ubiquitous local dish in Belize. It was served with sweet plantains which were tender and excellent. My husband had the pot roast beef stew($6.95) which was incredibly flavorful and a gastronomical surprise! We both came to a mutual agreement (which doesn't happen very often in our marriage) that everything here is off-the-chart 5-star worthy. The only negative is that we didn't see anything on the their menu with coconut sauce, such as, Belizean Chicken in coconut sauce. This is NOT a Jamaican restaurant, so don't confuse it with Jamaican cuisine just because you see \"Jerk Chicken\" on the menu. When you eat a super hot chili pepper, you might sweat, burn the roof of your mouth, shed a few tears and your nose may even start running. To some people, this is a dining bliss experience. Not me. I don't want to be in pain when I eat. I don't want to cry when I eat. Think of comparing Jamaican jerk chicken and Belizean jerk chicken against a habanero pepper versus a jalapeno pepper. The habanero pepper has 40 times more heat than the jalapeno pepper.What we ordered was marinated with bell peppers, onions, vinegar, paprika and black pepper. The meats simmer for hours which makes them incredibly luscious, tender and succulent. We went here for lunch on Sunday, and started with the jerk chicken wings which had the right amount of kick. We also tried the conch fritters, with a crispy exterior and a tender melt-in-your mouth interior. These reminded me of cod fritters that my mom used to make for us when I was much younger. The conch fritters were ethereal and prodigious! We left here satisfied, electrified and our palates gratified.We never would have known about Garifuna Flava had it not been for them being at the Lakeview Taco Fest in 2014. They were serving up jerk chicken tacos worthy of more than 5-stars. Seriously! I recommend going here for lunch (they close at 8 pm on Sunday). The lunch portions were generous and very reasonable. My husband practically made love to his dessert: The caramel pound cake (also known as \"Milk Cake\") which he said was \"really outstanding!\" We are already planning a return visit, but next time, it will be dinner. The restaurant is bright, clean, welcoming and colorful. The employees were very hospitable, and we were made to feel like we were long-time customers. This is more than a 5-star worthy restaurant.

I started off my dinner by ordering the Belizean long island which was recommended by my server (nice choice) and started with the 3-3-1 appetizer platter. \u00a0The 3-3-1 appetizer platter consisted of 3 jerk wings, 3 panes, and 1 garnache. Jerk wings were good, panes were excellent, and the garnache was delish! Panes are very similar to the latin empanadas, but belizean version. They were filled with fish mix and was perfectly crisp outside and cooked perfectly inside. Went well with the sauce too. \u00a0The garnache was my favorite, very similar to the mexican tostadas with beans, cheese, sour cream and etc. The garnache was a bit different, it included tostada, cabbage mix, cheeses, and ketchup sauce. I normally HATE eating ketchup on my food but this was the perfect exception. My main dish was the stew chicken, which was great! \u00a0It was packed with flavor and was served in stew sauce rather than in a stew. \u00a0It was medium spicey, kind of peppery, and the chicken was tender and falling of the bones. My overall experience was awesome, server was nice and insightful (young black women with dreads), \u00a0good was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the restaurant was cozy for a cold night. Definitely going back, it is a MUST try people!", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 11, 17]}, "1": {"description": "Really solid food at a great price range.

Growing up in Englewood, I was always disappointed in the lack of food options. How many times can one eat from the same Chinese restaurant, really? I still have family in the area, so today on a visit I decided to try out this restaurant.  \u00a0 \u00a0 There were two other people ordering with me and we placed a pretty large carry out order. We were told 20 minutes, and when we arrived it was all ready to go. We ordered the panades, conch fritters, conch soup, plantain chips and guacamole, and the Jamaican jerk and Belizean stew chicken lunch specials. I was so surprised when the total was less than 45 bucks!  \u00a0 \u00a0 Now onto the food: the panades had a good flavor, but I would have preferred a bit more filling. The plantain chips and guacamole were delicious and the portion size was great. The conch fritters were huge and were so delicious-definitely my favorite out of what we tried. They could have been a tad less greasy, though. The side conch soup was actually huge and full of veggies and seafood.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The lunch specials came with some side choices and we chose rice and beans, garden salad, potato salad, and stewed cabbage so we could try it all. The chicken in both lunch specials was flavorful and not dry. The jerk sauce was good too. Out of our sides, the cabbage was definitely the best. My husband enjoyed the potato salad, but he was literally given a tablespoon's worth. That was truly the only bummer out of our experience.  \u00a0 \u00a0 If you're in the area, definitely try this place out.

I was greeted by a horrible experience today. I had a conference call to conduct. I was late for the call and decided to sit down and make the call, I had every intention to purchase something once the call was completed. During the call, I was repeatedly harassed several times by a staff member and once by the owner of the establishment to buy something or leave! Now while I might have worn what you may consider \"urban apparel\" and not a tuxedo this is no way to treat a returning/potential customer! I felt embarrassed during the call with a new hire candidate to halt the call to reassure staff I was going to purchase an item. After the call I proceeded to the register to purchase a coffee and juice and wanted to voice my disappointing opinion to the owner. I was told he \"left\" no more than 10 minutes after confronting me. Whether he was there hiding or really did leave I left my business card and told the staff member who confronted me initially this is not a way to run a business. She began to dribble generalizations and decided to tell me that I was part of a problem that begun after I walked in and another customer sat in their establishment without purchasing. I was floored! On top of the harassment, I'm now part of a conspiracy with a stranger I've never met to waste your resources? She then said: \"Birds of a feather, flock together!\" My brain could not believe what I was hearing. I would say the staff member did thank me for some reason but I felt it was a contrived effort to deescalate the situation before it became worst. In conclusion, as a fellow business-owner I empathize with the daily struggles it takes to run a business and when you encounter a potential customer who may appear to be taking advantage of your gratitude it may feel like a slap in the face. I get it. However, I live one block away, have frequented the business numerous times and was treated like total trash today. I wasn't a bum looking to rudely hassle the other customers for money. I was clearly a busy customer who thought a neighborhood coffee shop such as Robust would be a \"friendly\" place to support and work at for an hour. Clearly Robust has become a product of an environment I thought was long forgotten in the Woodlawn Community even with the surrounding crime/violence.

I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn. Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. Seriously, I have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing!

I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating?

Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi.

First off, I can eat a TON of pizza. If it's great, I can eat a few tons. They have to wheel barrow me out of the best pizza joints, and happily so. Problem was, I was thinking in terms of New Orleans, California, East Coast, etc. and these were geographically and volumetric-ally off by major margins. Order staff looked at me and my diminutive female guest and advised a small. I brushed her off like the rhino to the fly and ordered the large (congratulating myself for the moderation I showed by not ordering the extra large). A large came and I plowed gustily into my first slice, pausing 2/3 through as I realized it was only slice #1 and I was already suffering jaw fatigue. This tore a serious chunk out of my appetite all by itself. Meanwhile, the pizza was great - tasty, piquant, rich, thick, joyous, incredibly filling and so on. I approached slice number two with more caution, but not enough. The last half of slice #2 had more pain than joy and I had to stop eating like it was pizza. Further ingestion was clearly going to be a matter of pacing and pride rather than the ravenous devastation I was used to when the flavor and mood struck.By the time the third slice became a possibility I was sweating like a Saudi Prince and asking myself whether I had (gasp!) made a horrible error in judgment.I had.My twiggy guest had eaten almost half of one slice and I managed only a few bites into #3 before giving up and leaving a good 4 pieces untouched.
