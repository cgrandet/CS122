Picture #2 pretty much says it all, a complete menu list handwritten on a single poster board sheet. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this was an in-house project. The layout, the spacing and most notably, the incredible discipline in not using larger than a size 40 font is certainly masterful. Conveniently, they have reserved the right border column for updating their prices. Save that poster board fellas for as long as you can! As the menu items fade with it's background getting dirtier, the updated price list section gets comparatively brighter. Ironic, such a complete shit hole, yet is able to deliver. I don't want to think about the cleanliness and what might be crawling around in this trailer trash hurricane ready shack. I just can't do it, I just can't, ordering anything from this place that has chili or cheese on it is simply insect roulette. They practically put chili or cheese on about 95% of their creations, so I'll be missing out. The fact that I can get up the nerve to order anything from this place is a miracle in itself. You'll have to experience it yourself, it goes beyond possessing your typical Chicago hot dog stand cheesiness. I can deal with a place that is run down with some effort in making it presentable. Hell, this place is so distressed that it makes Sanford & Son's store front look good. youtube.com/watch?v=1Wqa\u2026 In the summer, the adjacent lot has front yard picnic benches which are cordoned off by a rickety old white picket fence. Don't mind the fact that you are dining in front of someones residence. If that isn't special enough, an old dingy in the parkway has been converted into a planter box. Who cares if only weeds grow in the seemingly out of place vessel. Johnnies is about the same distance on the south side from downtown as Fluky's was on the north side, kinda like hot dog stand bookmarks on the longest street in the world. This place looks like it needs to be torn down while the Fluky's that was taken over by U(n) Lucky Dawg remains closed. Now Johnnies won't be serving up a Vienna dog and a David Berg will have to do. That's all right, at least Vienna owns the company.", "rating": "4", "date": [2009, 12, 25]}, "9": {"description": "Anyone who calls Fat Johnnie's overrated should be burned at the stake.

That was what had my coworker and myself had been doing for most of the morning. We had been fueled by the vision of the tacos we would eat after our third home visit, and Tacos Villa was fulfilled our fungus-influenced expectations. Though the small restaurant was a little toasty on the hot afternoon, we were comfortable on a bar stools watching our orders take place eyes watering and noses itching. Sometimes, you just need to zone out watching a guy use a masa press and look at a map about the breweries of Mexico. I ordered a chicken sope, rice and beans, and an horchata. The Horchata was thin, cold, not too sweet, and really cinnamon-y, the signs of an excellent horchata. The yellow rice and refried beans were served in a little boat-shaped dish. These were so much better than so many rice and beans I have eaten so many times- perfectly cooked and slightly garlic-y, they stood on their own, enhanced by the vinegary-green and funky-red salsa that came on the side, but not needing that accompaniment. My chicken sope was a delicately arranged tower. I usually avoid sopes because they are messy and sometimes the tortilla-base-thing sucks, but this was the opposite of that. The deep-fried base was crispy, delicate- Hugh's S. Description of \"biscuit\" is not off the mark. The pollo top came in big, lean pieces, well marinated and cooked. Sometimes, ordering pollo is asking for shredded skin and fat with zero percent seasoning, but this chicken was had a flavor somewhere between curry and mole- a perfect contrast to the crunch of the biscuit and lettuce. A Note! They do not have chips or avocado. \u00a0If these are food items are requirements for you, you need to expand your palate but you're not going to be happy here.  \u00a0As I look back on my recent visit to Tacos Villa, I am filled with kindheartedness and a sense of nostalgia.

I have always had issues finding someone to do my hair without damaging it and I thought I had found that with the two sisters (Alicia and Araceli) - I was WRONG. I had been going to Classic Touch for over 8 years and the sisters always did a fabulous job whether it was the cut, the style or the color. Up until recently I have not been too happy with them. I only get my hair done with the two sisters and no one else and they both should have known this detail about me for being such a repeat customer. In November 2013 I decided to go ombre - Araceli had done such a fabulous job with it! When I returned in January for a touch up, her sister, Alicia, did the touch up. After having the dye washed out of my hair, the end result was my hair being dyed a platinum blonde. I dont know how often you see platinum blonde ombre on someone's head, but that is not how I wanted it or how I had it the first time - I had a more subtle blonde. I literally was about to cry because now the color was not what I wanted, but also my hair was fried to the max! Alicia decided in order to bring down the color she needed to put some toner... end result - my hair turned silver and purple. I wanted to cry. How was I going to go to school or to my internship with purple hair. Luckily after a few washes the ends became a darker blonde. However my ends were fried to the point where I could not leave my hair down - it looked like straw. Months later I was done with the ombre and decided to go back brunette. Araceli said that I should go darker than my natural hair to get the blonde out. I thought \"Okay, she'll do it and it'll look fab like all the times before\". NOPE. Because she was sooo busy with another client here ASSISTANT dyed my hair. LET ME REMIND YOU THAT I NEVER LET ANYONE ELSE BESIDES THE SISTERS DO MY CUT/STYLE/OR DYE. The assistant covered my hair in black ... missing spots along the way. I did not know that my hair was not fully covered until I got home and was told. My issue was with the sisters - they did not take care of my hair the way I thought they would. I gotten my hair straightened by Alicia and she never once thought to let me know that the assistant missed parts of my hair. How unprofessional is that? I have gone through the ringer with this salon and I will never go back. It was good while it lasted, however I thought I found my \"go-to\" place for hair. Now to start searching again.

Nearly ten years to be exact, and each and every experience with this business was pleasant until recently.

I'm not a color expert, but last time I checked there was a difference between the two shades. I also pointed to the color swatch I liked and provided a picture of their previous work. When I saw the end product, I didn't know how to react. While I stared at the hot mess, Angelica convinced me that after several washes the color would fade to what I wanted. Little did I know, I'd wash my hair and the red would bleed into the blonde making me look like Carrot Top's sister. This was beyond a hot mess! I called and let them know what the situation was and Araceli, the shop manager assured me she would fix it. I went in and again the same stylist took care of me. I asked her to get rid of the red, and so she began. Turns out she just toned it down. Again, not what I asked for. Notice any patterns? Anyways, third is sorta the charm because I was fed up and just wanted it all gone. She covered it with a half effort job because now I have random patches of red, and burgundy over my natural color. As if this wasn't enough, all through out this return visit, Angelica was passive- aggressive. Smiling at me but snickering on the side, and very hard on my head, pulling and tugging at my hair as she \"fixed\" it. After this experience, it is needless to say that I will not be returning.

I tell him \"hey dude try it first, it might be hot\". \"I'll be ok\" he replied. Lol needless to say he wasn't. Lets put it this way I saw a couple of tears on his face LOL. Now I have something to bash him with for months. Point being that habanero salsa is extremely hot, beware.After my laughing about my friend trying to get rid of the burn, we get \u00a0the food. Everything was delicious. The carne Zamora comes with a good size skirt steak, cooked to perfection, a quesadilla, Mexican chorizo, whole beans, rice, grilled green onions and jalape\u00f1o. Truly delicious combination. The langostinos are good, well seasoned (not too salty or over seasoned) fresh good quality prawns.But then, the pi\u00f1a rellena (stuffed pineapple) .... \u00a0Can't find the proper term to describe it without sounding like a teenager (erase: OMG, heavenly, seriously) f*^ing perfect. The perfect combination of flavors. Half pineapple, scooped out the flesh, grilled shrimp, octopus, fish cheese and broiled. You get the sweetness of the pineapple combined with the seafood and then a little bit of heat from the hot peppers and to top it off some melted cheese. This was some serious good eating. This comes with rice, salad, garlic bread and fries.After eating all that food I wished there was more pina rellena, not because I was still hungry, or the portion (portions are huge) but because that is one of those addicting flavors that you can't stop eating (or at least I). \u00a0Yeap it was that good.Can't wait to come back on a week end. I think they have music or karaoke. At least that is what the waitress told me, service is super nice and attentive. They checked on us a few times throughout the dinner. When we got the check I was surprised the prices are reasonable here.

I've never liked stew chicken from other restaurants i've tried, but they hit it right on the nail with how they prepare it.Jerk Chicken: It wasn't bad, but i've had better in Chicago. As mentioned in a previous review, the jerk chicken isn't spicy at all and almost tasted like normal bbq chicken...but what made me like it, is when i dipped the chicken in the side of green sauce they give you. Once i did that, then the jerk chicken had a chance. Rice and Beans: Extremely good, great texture, and especially loved the gravy that they pour on top of it. Was the best rice and beans i've ever had. Would definitely order this again. \u00a0Cabbage: The cabbage was good, it had a hint of spiciness to it which i loved about it. No complaints here and would order this side again.Overall the food was great. I almost feel like i was charged a premium for the fact they were bringing the food to my company vs. me picking the food up at their actual restaurant. Paid $25 for all of the food above, and each were in very small containers. Hope when i visit the restaurant the portions are a bit bigger for the cost, but overall good!

Very tender and packed with flavor. All entrees are served with choice rice & beans, stew beans or split peas, fried ripe plantains and choice salad.\" KILLER.

I straight recommend getting just the wings over this, because the other 2 elements were just a-ok.4: Conch soup and Hudut Baruru I recommend as well.4: Red Snapper \"This very popular white fish is delicate to the core. Served whole, it is deep fried & garnished in a sweet pepper, tomato, purple onion & garlic based creole sauce.\"Whoaw.

If you enjoy caribbean-style cuisine, you will definitely enjoy the Traditional Belizean stewed chicken which is perfection in a bowl. It had a reddish color due to Recado (also known as \"Achiote\"), which is a commonly known spice in Belize. It is known for providing an amalgamation of slightly sweet and peppery flavors to stews, fish, chicken, beef, soups and sauces. It is the \"Holy Grail\" of spices in Belize. The food here is truly hearty, delectable, bright, bold and ethereal. I had the chicken stew ($5.95), and opted for the rice and beans which is a ubiquitous local dish in Belize. It was served with sweet plantains which were tender and excellent. My husband had the pot roast beef stew($6.95) which was incredibly flavorful and a gastronomical surprise! We both came to a mutual agreement (which doesn't happen very often in our marriage) that everything here is off-the-chart 5-star worthy. The only negative is that we didn't see anything on the their menu with coconut sauce, such as, Belizean Chicken in coconut sauce. This is NOT a Jamaican restaurant, so don't confuse it with Jamaican cuisine just because you see \"Jerk Chicken\" on the menu. When you eat a super hot chili pepper, you might sweat, burn the roof of your mouth, shed a few tears and your nose may even start running. To some people, this is a dining bliss experience. Not me. I don't want to be in pain when I eat. I don't want to cry when I eat. Think of comparing Jamaican jerk chicken and Belizean jerk chicken against a habanero pepper versus a jalapeno pepper. The habanero pepper has 40 times more heat than the jalapeno pepper.What we ordered was marinated with bell peppers, onions, vinegar, paprika and black pepper. The meats simmer for hours which makes them incredibly luscious, tender and succulent. We went here for lunch on Sunday, and started with the jerk chicken wings which had the right amount of kick. We also tried the conch fritters, with a crispy exterior and a tender melt-in-your mouth interior. These reminded me of cod fritters that my mom used to make for us when I was much younger. The conch fritters were ethereal and prodigious! We left here satisfied, electrified and our palates gratified.We never would have known about Garifuna Flava had it not been for them being at the Lakeview Taco Fest in 2014. They were serving up jerk chicken tacos worthy of more than 5-stars. Seriously! I recommend going here for lunch (they close at 8 pm on Sunday). The lunch portions were generous and very reasonable. My husband practically made love to his dessert: The caramel pound cake (also known as \"Milk Cake\") which he said was \"really outstanding!\" We are already planning a return visit, but next time, it will be dinner. The restaurant is bright, clean, welcoming and colorful. The employees were very hospitable, and we were made to feel like we were long-time customers. This is more than a 5-star worthy restaurant. Seriously.This restaurant was featured on \"Check Please!\" It was also featured on the \"Food Network,\" \"The Hungry Hound\" and \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\"Price Point = 5 starsService: 5 starsLunch for two people (with water only) was under $30 and slightly over $25 (plenty of food for sharing too)", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 9, 21]}, "9": {"description": "Based upon the reviews, I decided to drag my little cousin along for a cultural dish.

As mentioned in a previous review, the jerk chicken isn't spicy at all and almost tasted like normal bbq chicken...but what made me like it, is when i dipped the chicken in the side of green sauce they give you. Once i did that, then the jerk chicken had a chance. Rice and Beans: Extremely good, great texture, and especially loved the gravy that they pour on top of it. Was the best rice and beans i've ever had. Would definitely order this again. \u00a0Cabbage: The cabbage was good, it had a hint of spiciness to it which i loved about it.

I try to explain that from her response I assume they only have vanilla ice cream and some sort of flavors of soda. She remains silent. He asks if they have cookies and cream. She shakes her head. Ok, he'll take a cookie. I ask what the shaken lemonade is. It's lemonade with flavors. Ok. We order a lemonade. \u00a0I ask how much the boxed water is (because it's fancy and people like to charge ridiculous prices for fancy stuff) She doesn't answer. Ok. \"So you want a cookie, a lemonade and a boxed water?\" No, I wanted to know how much the water is. $2. No thanks. She fresh squeezed (awesome!) the lemonade for my daughter and hands it to me.

I was greeted by a horrible experience today. I had a conference call to conduct. I was late for the call and decided to sit down and make the call, I had every intention to purchase something once the call was completed. During the call, I was repeatedly harassed several times by a staff member and once by the owner of the establishment to buy something or leave! Now while I might have worn what you may consider \"urban apparel\" and not a tuxedo this is no way to treat a returning/potential customer! I felt embarrassed during the call with a new hire candidate to halt the call to reassure staff I was going to purchase an item. After the call I proceeded to the register to purchase a coffee and juice and wanted to voice my disappointing opinion to the owner. I was told he \"left\" no more than 10 minutes after confronting me. Whether he was there hiding or really did leave I left my business card and told the staff member who confronted me initially this is not a way to run a business. She began to dribble generalizations and decided to tell me that I was part of a problem that begun after I walked in and another customer sat in their establishment without purchasing. I was floored! On top of the harassment, I'm now part of a conspiracy with a stranger I've never met to waste your resources? She then said: \"Birds of a feather, flock together!\" My brain could not believe what I was hearing. I would say the staff member did thank me for some reason but I felt it was a contrived effort to deescalate the situation before it became worst. In conclusion, as a fellow business-owner I empathize with the daily struggles it takes to run a business and when you encounter a potential customer who may appear to be taking advantage of your gratitude it may feel like a slap in the face. I get it. However, I live one block away, have frequented the business numerous times and was treated like total trash today. I wasn't a bum looking to rudely hassle the other customers for money. I was clearly a busy customer who thought a neighborhood coffee shop such as Robust would be a \"friendly\" place to support and work at for an hour. Clearly Robust has become a product of an environment I thought was long forgotten in the Woodlawn Community even with the surrounding crime/violence. It has in its time active here in our neighborhood turned into a rude place that I will NEVER recommend to be visited to my friends and family for the foreseeable future.

I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn. Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. Seriously, I have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing! I will continue to be a happy customer at Robust as long as I work in Woodlawn.", "rating": "4", "date": [2014, 11, 21]}, "22": {"description": "I tried their \"special\" biscuits with sausage gravy but unfortunately, it was far from special.

First off, I can eat a TON of pizza. If it's great, I can eat a few tons. They have to wheel barrow me out of the best pizza joints, and happily so. Problem was, I was thinking in terms of New Orleans, California, East Coast, etc. and these were geographically and volumetric-ally off by major margins. Order staff looked at me and my diminutive female guest and advised a small. I brushed her off like the rhino to the fly and ordered the large (congratulating myself for the moderation I showed by not ordering the extra large). A large came and I plowed gustily into my first slice, pausing 2/3 through as I realized it was only slice #1 and I was already suffering jaw fatigue. This tore a serious chunk out of my appetite all by itself. Meanwhile, the pizza was great - tasty, piquant, rich, thick, joyous, incredibly filling and so on. I approached slice number two with more caution, but not enough. The last half of slice #2 had more pain than joy and I had to stop eating like it was pizza. Further ingestion was clearly going to be a matter of pacing and pride rather than the ravenous devastation I was used to when the flavor and mood struck.By the time the third slice became a possibility I was sweating like a Saudi Prince and asking myself whether I had (gasp!) made a horrible error in judgment.I had.My twiggy guest had eaten almost half of one slice and I managed only a few bites into #3 before giving up and leaving a good 4 pieces untouched.

Today, however, left me a bit peeved. I bought several glass items and after noticing the way the cashier just put them aside, asked him would he be wrapping them in paper or something.

This is something that should be stated up front. \u00a0I would not have gotten the items if I had known that. Also, his demeanor about it, while not nasty, was not customer-oriented, He made no effort to turn around and look for something to substitute for wrap or anything. He closed the register after ringing me up and left. Okay. The kicker is when I was wrapping my glass items in the dish towels, that I am so glad that I purchased, he returns to where I am, picks up a lint brush, which I tell him belongs to me, to which he responds, \"I need to see your receipt\". Now, perhaps, I am being unreasonable but that irked \u00a0me.
