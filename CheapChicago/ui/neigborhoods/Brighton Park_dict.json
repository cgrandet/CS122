But we said no to that offer because it was not cheaper because the special included the biscuits. So then we paid with credit card and when we got the receipt back, the cashier STILL ordered the special with an extra large side. Even though it's was only like $1.50 more, we explained that we did not want the biscuit meal and wanted to order separately. The manager or someone that was in charge went over to the cash register and handed me $1 and eagerly said that is more than we owe you. I told her that the difference is more than $1. The manager then went on and said NO, $1 is more than enough because it's PLUS TAX. Who charges tax on returns?!?!!? KFC is suppose to be giving back the tax that WE PAID. I' not sure how she got the job when she doesn't even know how to calculate simple math.

The building looks like a bunch of red bricks being held together with mortar, which reminds me of preschoolers putting Lego blocks together. Now, this is not a negative review about the restaurant. Do not let the looks of the building fool you, Pacos Tacos is a very popular taco joint. Pacos Tacos is a hole in the wall restaurant, where people go to grab a quick breakfast, lunch or dinner. The moment you walk in the restaurant, you will notice how small it actually is and you'll start to question yourself whether it was a good idea or not that you came. The appearance may appear unappealing but trust me, the food will make up for the appearance. You will not see sets of table and chairs like an ordinary restaurant would have, but instead you will be greeted by a counter with about 8 wooden stools for you to eat your food. The place is usually quite packed because of the high demands for its delicious tacos. People always seem to be in a rush whenever they order from this place so do not expect anyone to be nice here. Everyone is here for the food, not to make friends. I've waited in line for about 10 minutes before I got my food. The food is made quickly because they had about three or four chefs working. You can tell that the chefs are skilled because they work quickly to get your food to you but at the same time, making sure the food is thoroughly cooked and seasoned right. I ordered two steak tacos, one al pastor (grilled pork), a lengua taco (beef tongue) and a large horchata (rice milk with cinnamon). I took it home to eat because the restaurant was really packed and it was starting to get very humid from all the steam and people standing next to each other.  The workers at Pacos Tacos are very generous about the portion sizes. I ordered all my tacos Mexican style (cilantro w/ onions) because that's the correct way to eat tacos. My steak tacos had so much meat on it, it looks like they put a whole cow on each taco. The meat was very tender, juicy and not dry like other Mexican restaurants. The onions had tons of flavor on it, enough to make a \"wasabi\" like feeling permeate my nose. I think I even started to tear up from the strong taste of the onions. This just tells you that the ingredients they use are very high quality and fresh. I finished the steak tacos quickly because they were so good, and so I could move onto my al pastor tacos. The al pastor tacos had a lot of juice in it, which explodes in flavor. The texture of the pork is so good, you could just let it sit on your tongue and it'll feel like it will never run out of flavor. The meat rips apart from each other easily, which is an indication that it is fresh. I quickly nom'd the tacos, while washing them down with the horchata. The horchata that I ordered was very large. It was a 32oz for just $3.50. You could taste the rich rice flavor and feel the gritty bits of cinnamon swimming in your mouth. While I was almost full from the large tacos I was served, I still had room for the beef tongue tacos. The beef tongue was really chewy and was bursting with flavor, like the al pastor. The salsa verde (green sauce) that was provided with the meal balances the flavor of the meat with tangy and spicy flavors. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and I would always go back for more. I will always be a customer of Pacos Tacos.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 4, 29]}, "42": {"description": "Let's get this clear. Nothing tastes as good as the tacos in Mexico.

There is A LOT of literature by what I presume to be faith, motivational and spiritual books. It has a very nice d\u00e9cor all around from top to bottom. I seated myself down stairs but took my nosy butt right up the stairs and flicked away to wonderful seating arrangements around the room as well as a fireplace. It's hardwood floors throughout, and I almost feel like I'm writing a review for design but hey its very inviting and so is the guy behind the coffee bar which is towards the end of the first floor.

When she finally came to our table she did not write our order down, which I've seen the same waitress do before, but our order this time around wasn't just tacos and tortas. I ordered the platter of flautitas, with choice of potato and chicken. My mom ordered the chicken tostadas, she told the waitress that she could not eat cilantro, she assured my mom that there is NO cilantro on the tostadas. Both our orders were wrong. I got beef flautitas and my mom got both tostadas with cilantro, not just sprinkled on top, the chicken was a mixture of cilantro and other veggies. I would think a waitress would know something like this. Besides the wrong orders, we waited 1 HOUR for our food only for it to be wrong!

However in this restaurant it takes forever for a simple item! No joke the last time I came here along with my family it took 20 minutes for my burrito to arrive! Which was inexcusable I mean come on the burrito is nothing more than a glorified taco on crack which is cool but it should not take 20+ minutes for it to arrive nor make.When the burrito came I was relived and pleasantly surprised at it's size, believe me this burrito is packed with meat and since I ordered it \"combinado\" which is basically a burrito that is stuffed with two different meats and in my case it was beef tongue and carne asada. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked and \u00a0the vegetables where fresh but they did not overshadow the meat which is important in an artery clogging burrito.The dinner plates here are inexpensive and varied as opposed to the other location which has overpriced and under portioned plate options and also unlike the other location this place gives you free chips and salsa! They suck and taste very stale but hey it's better that paying two bucks a pop for the same thing at the other location. Back to the service yeah it's slooow even with a half empty restaurant the waitresses here take their time for example: five minutes to attend you and bring you their crappy chips and modest salsa:five more minutes to take your order and or bring your drinks:then ten to twenty minutes for your tacos,tortas, or burritos that is unless you order a dinner plate. That's right prepare to be discriminated if you order a simple taco,torta, or burrito but if you order a plate of something anything lo and behold you get it almost immediately well seven or eight minutes but it's still a huge difference when compared to the standard tacos etc.It's sad that the service is so lackluster because this place is actually really delicious and the decor is a mixture of a cantina and traditional Mexican but with a subdued but relaxing atmosphere thanks in large part to the fact that it's caters to families and other working class individuals. Don't worry there are no drunken idiots here since I'm quite sure they water down the alcohol well except the beer.The parking is also a mess especially on a busy weekend so if you plan on coming here plan accordingly and if you don't speak Spanish don't worry just look at the menu and do like Russian roulette and hope for the best.Verdict: If you want tacos,tortas or burritos go to the other location on 5151 S Kedzie Ave but if you want \u00a0a good dinner plate with good flavor and solid portions(and good prices) come here but with horribly lazy and slow waitresses and service it could test your patience so consumer beware.No go and have a taco you deserve it:)", "rating": "3", "date": [2012, 4, 10]}, "8": {"description": "OUR FAMILY GO TO for quick bites, late night carryout, dinner and alcoholic drinks or just a nice family dinner.

I would choose this place over two $5 pizzas from Little Cesars in a heartbeat.

Each table is adorned with a surprisingly large \u00a0assortment of good hot sauces (El Yucateco, Tamazula, Salsa Huichol, Valentina, Tapatio, etc.).

They clearly know how to prepare seafood here.Based on the food, I would give Mariscos a solid 4 stars, especially considering the relatively low price.
