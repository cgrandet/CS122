Another salon cancelled my appointment hours beforehand (so annoying), so I was in a bit of a bind. Especially because most salons are not open on Mondays or close very, very early. This world is simply not made for the working woman.Art of Hair Design is right next to my usual nail salon in the neighborhood, and I thought, why not? I called around 2PM and got an appointment at 6:15PM, which was perfect. I noticed on their door that they accept walk-ins, too, which is great.Some things I enjoyed about my experience include the speed (in and out in about 45 minutes), the friendliness of the two hairdressers, the unpretentious atmosphere, and the extreme quality of the service. Sure, this place is no frills. But I don't need a cup of Armenian mint tea while I wait 20 minutes past my appointment time. I'd rather sit down right away and get to it.Bona gave a great shampoo and a really beautiful haircut. I'm growing my hair out a little, and she knew exactly how to layer it to give it more texture while not compromising the length.The salon is usually a rushed, anxiety-provoking experience because of confusing pass-offs between shampoo people and hairdressers, and lots of bizarre tipping rituals like dropping an envelope of cash into a small Buddha and stashing singles in your bra quickly to give to a shampoo girl. When I leave work, I don't want to think. I don't want to have to figure out where to stash my coat and how to get back to a stylist's station in a 4000 square foot space with no direction.When all was said and done, I paid $50 and got a really great haircut. She tackled all my split ends and I feel like I will be able to go longer than usual between haircuts because it was so well-done.If you go to the salon for the Kiehl's lotion in the bathroom or the sensory oils massaged on your scalp, please just keep paying for your $90 haircut from a guy named Sebastian with an angular haircut and a Gucci logo belt.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 7, 16]}, "10": {"description": "I was in Chicago for work and agonizing over whether to dye my gray roots or just grow them out. \u00a0A friend who works with hair recommended a way to grow it out. \u00a0I called Art of Hair Design and when I went for my appointment with Lena, she said exactly the same tonight about how to grow it out. \u00a0Her highlights and cut were impeccable and I have gotten a ton of compliments. \u00a0She did a great threading of my eyebrows as well. \u00a0It is a big airy clean salon with such a great staff!If I am ever in Chicago again, I will go to Art of Hair Design!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 2, 13]}, "11": {"description": "If you r looking for a fancy, \"be seen\" scene, u'll want to look for another salon. \u00a0This is a friendly, neighborhood salon that welcomes appts or walk ins. \u00a0I've had my hair colored and cut by all 3 of the stylists there and their work is great, reasonable and consistent. \u00a0The owner, Lena, takes great pride in her shop and services. \u00a0Bona and Diana are equally talented and friendly.

Finally, 4 chairs open up and then I have to wait another 10-15 minutes to be seated - AWAY from the entire group.

The maid of honor booked the party and we were all set!A group of twenty or so of us gathered one Saturday afternoon for the bachelorette. The salon is long and narrow with a little bar in front, and several mani-pedi stations. We all pitched in pay extra for a \"room\" so we wouldn't have to cluster together in the salon area. The \"room\" was a small seating area in the back of the salon with some couches and access to an outdoor balcony area. It was nice to have that space, but I don't think we should've paid extra for it -- if we hadn't paid, we probably would have used that room anyway because there was nowhere else in the salon to gather! Anyway... the polish and pour process was pretty smooth. We all took turns (several at a time) getting our nails done while the others sat around drinking in the room. It was BYOB for beer and wine, but a corkage fee if you wanted to mix drinks (since you'd have to use their glasses).... even if you brought the stuff yourself! Whaaat! Lame (for those who wanted that). Sex and the City episodes were on repeat the whole time. Since most of the women in the party group were deaf, and we couldn't talk with our hands because they were getting polished, we spent a lot of time watching TV as we waited. Heh. At least we could chat and sip wine during our pedicures! That was nice.My $50-ish mani-pedi lasted a few weeks. I was pretty impressed with that. That was the only thing that impressed me.

I winced as she pulled and cut my cuticles (not just the dead skin).My tolerance juice started kicking in and we conversed. The neighboring estheticians joined in and we had pleasant chatter about their respective countries and the Russian language.Polish & Pour is a great spot for a nail party with some friends as a precursor to going out.

I have very mixed feelings about my experience. Being very indecisive, I generally look to professionals to assist in the decision-making process and the overall inspiration for projects at crafty places as such. So here's how it went down. It was a Sunday night and we had a table of 6 girls with us. So they automatically charge a $10 fee per person for their help. Okay, fair enough. But keep in mind that there were six of us and really no other patrons. There were 4 employees working the store. I personally had three different employees trying to assist me, but then I would say \"is this going to be a lot of work, or expensive or too challenging\" and they would each have a different answer that usually drove me away from my original idea. Then they would just walk away. Finally, I got frustrated and headed back to the table empty-handed saying I was ready to cry because I was so overwhelmed (yes, sometimes I can be overly dramatic) and one of the employees offered to help me. She was great and didn't try to talk me out of what I wanted to do. So that was a step in the right direction. We gathered all the things we needed and went back. Now the three employees and the six of us sat doing our projects. The employees were like one of us, chatting away and exchanging anecdotes and being very personable and pleasant. Another plus. The chairs we sat on were cute to look at, but functional they were not. They were basically little beautiful tree stumps. This has very little to do with the experience, but thought I would throw that out there. While doing our projects the employees didn't really show us what to do as much as they took over our earrings and more or less just made them for us. I repeatedly mentioned that I wanted a chain to run through my beaded necklace and alas, my necklace came back completed sans chain. All of this would have been fine, not great, but if it weren't for the horrific end result which was the checking out I would have said this was an okay experience. So things aren't very clearly marked or labeled so it's easy to get carried away without realizing what you're spending but for the life of me I can't figure out how my simple little beaded necklace, like the kind you get at a Claire's cost me $60. My friend spent $90 on a necklace and now has to eat ramen for the rest of the week. Not a single one of us left without paying a minimum of $50 for things that we weren't overly impressed with. I now learned that to do the type of beading we did today, we could have easily bought beads, pliers, clasps, and rings at a craft store and made these things for a fraction of the price. I loved the idea of a place like this, but I just can't justify the cost especially because it was complete sticker shock! I also looked at the classes and for $60 you get to \"learn\" how to make something and a bracelet and earrings are included in that price - a much better deal than I feel we got. Like I said, I really liked the girls that we were working with if we were out at a bar let's say, but I'm sad that I can't love this place more and give it a better review.", "rating": "3", "date": [2011, 1, 16]}, "56": {"description": "I looove this place, the only thing I hate about it is how much money I spend when I checkout.

My girlfriend and I decided that we would go to beadniks for her birthday and we called ahead the night before to make sure that we didn't need an appointment to get personal help with the process - they told us it would be fine to walk in.

We wanted to make jewelry however and after a while of browsing through their beads we sought help. We had also brought in stones that we already had to ask if they drill them there.The response the woman had to that was quite snarky and off putting. We had expected that this could not be done there, though at that point we were fairly annoyed by the response about it, and asked for help with making something using the beads they have there. The woman gave us a tray and pointed us to a table where we were completely ignored from then on. No one told us about the materials to use or what to do. We sat there looking at beads for a while before inquiring further. When we did we were given a short response, that was not helpful, and the woman went about something else. Finally, were annoyed enough to leave an when we did so no one said anything to us.

However, when we got our rolls, my friend with the allergy was smart enough to double check. The food runner told us in fact one of the rolls did have imitation crab, and we could keep it and sub it for another roll. We asked our waiter to sub us another roll, he still charged us for the one with sulfa. We asked to speak to the manager, who said he would take half off a roll, but never did. Terrible service.

It's not that I gravitate towards high-quality sushi (or would even be able to tell you what would be considered quality sushi as opposed to not) -- but I seem to have an unfortunate knack for liking 'special' things. For example, after finally expanding my seafood horizons to include crab legs -- I immediately took a liking to King Crab -- and an even more immediate *dis*liking to those other crab legs (see, I dislike them so much I can't even remember what they're called). Little did I know that I was setting myself up for disappointment, as King Crab is a rarity unless you're willing to shell out bigger bucks. Another testament to this is my unintentional tuna prejudice. And this segues nicely into the focus of this review...I'm fairly new to the sushi world. Until maybe a year or so ago, I was the girl at the AYCE sushi spot trying to get her $$$ worth by filling up on gyoza, miso soup, chicken yakitori, and whatever random non-sushi items included on the menu (one can only have so many mandarin orange slices). I then graduated to rolls -- so long as they were cooked. This still left me somewhat restricted, as beyond the shrimp tempura roll and unagi -- there wasn't too much that I could really order. Wanting to be a bit more adventurous, I set out to try raw sushi. Now, a gigantic piece of raw tuna probably wasn't the way to ease into it, but that's what I went with -- and I nearly lost my lunch. True story. It took me a good minute to swallow -- and it only went down because I chased it with a giant gulp of water. Ugh. \"Never again!\" I exclaimed. \u00a0And so for awhile, I played it safe with my trusty shrimp tempura rolls. And then entered the super white tuna (cue heavenly music). Now THIS was a piece of raw tuna I could delight in. So light...not overly fishy...melts in your mouth...mmm. I had found my go-to sushi.But wait...super white tuna isn't on every sushi menu?! Especially not most AYCE sushi menus? What's a girl to do? Go to Caf\u00e9 Sushi, that's what! Their menu boasts not one, but at least 3 options made with the elusive pale fishy! Super white tuna lovers rejoice!We started with the much talked-about 'Honey Bee' roll. White tuna, avocado and cucumber, topped with tempura crunch -- and drizzled with honey! Very unexpected, but oh-so-delicious! The honey had a way of tying all the other flavors together, without being in-your-face sweet. But my true Love -- The 'Snow White' roll. I have to pause for a moment before I continue, as I get a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it. Avocado and shrimp tempura inside -- topped with super white tuna and the prettiest red tobiko. It was perfection on a plate! On presentation alone, this roll was already a winner. And then I put it in my mouth. Total. Food Porn. Moment. Mmmmmmm. And actually, super white tuna aside -- EVERYTHING we had was amazing. The 'Mango Habanero' was a delightful blend of sweet and spicy, while the 'Hawaiian Maki' was a nice take on a warm sushi roll. \u00a0And if you really want to spice up your night -- the 'Mexican Maki' (with jalapeno!) won't disappoint!And bonus -- this is a BYOB joint!

My bf got one of the burgers with pork belly which he said was up there with the burgers he's tried so far in Chi.

One couple came in, and after waiting for fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and at least say hello, left. On to the food- the smoked gouda mac and cheese was really good, and my BBQ bacon burger was okay. The tempura fried bacon was disappointing, especially because the deep fried batter took away from the taste of the bacon, but it was a well cooked burger. At the end of the meal when we asked for separate checks, our server was visibly irritated by it- that's the first time that's ever happened to me in any restaurant.

Our waitress was very nice and the service was good. I had the friend cauliflower buffalo sauce appetizer which was just ok and a raspberry beer which again was just ok as well. The issue came when we were closing our tabs. We all were closing our tabs when the manager confronted our group and asked to check IDs because only 21+ are allowed past a certain time, so that's fine. We all are in our mid-late twenties so there was no issue however the manager was VERY rude to us when asking for IDs and was claiming that someone was not 21 even though we all just showed them proof. It came off a little rude and made it awkward but I understand she was trying to do her job and make sure we weren't underage. So a girl in our group pulled the manager aside to let just let her know that the way she asked us was rude and for regularly attending customers, she didn't appreciate the way she made us feel, which was not welcomed. Instead of the manager taking responsibility and apologizing for thinking we were underage, the manager argued with my friend and got our waitress involved stating that we were trying to blow off our waitress by not showing her our IDs. She also made claims that we are supposed to leave within 10 minutes of closing our tabs. I understand, the business of a restaurant is to turn tables over to make money but when your customer is still finishing their drinks, they are not going to just leave (and especially when the whole place is empty so there's not a line of people waiting). This was such a stupid experience and I hate to be explaining this but all in all, I work in the service industry and the way the manager conducted herself and made our whole group feel terrible after we just dined there is NOT the way to treat customers. Instead of simply apologizing and taking ownership she argued and made other excuses for why she took the tone with us. This poor review is solely based on the management and the wait staff as our waitress did not defend us and lied to her manager to probably save her job. I HOPE the owners read this and look into who is running their bar and think about changing the way this manager conducts herself because she is driving away business. I will not be coming back to this place along with the rest of our group. I know a lot of people in the area and I will not be recommending this place from now on unless management changes.

I was here for a couple of world cup games and the service definitely suffered.That said the food was so good I got over it. Fast forward to today....our food was a very simple order, two orders of chicken fingers and an order of fries. First off the food took an eternity. I seriously finished two beers in the time it took to cook our food. Dude are you killing the chicken back there??? To top it off they were NOT busy. There was ONE other table in the entire place. When the food arrived I was HORRIBLY dissapointed. Mind you I've eaten this exact thing before so I was expecting what I had received all of the other times I'd ordered this, 5 good sized, juicy, spicy chicken fingers. Not so much. What arrives is three tiny chicken fingers on a plate(for $8 no less, sides are extra people), and our \"side\" order of fries was about the same as a Mcdonald's child size order of fries on a tiny plate. Is there a potato shortage I haven't read about? Aside from the tiny portions the chicken fingers were way overcooked. So dry you had to drowned them in ranch to choke them down, and the ends were hard like they were either freezer burned or had been refried.Staff said the old chef left, I'd met him as when it was slower he'd walk around and see how everything was. This new guy walked by us about 5 times and never said boo even though it was totally dead. He must not have wanted to hear that he doesn't even know how to fry a chicken finger.

But my experience here was so negative, something must be said.My friend and I were meeting here for a couple drinks and some food after work on Friday. I finish work about an hour before my friend so I decided to come early and have a drink at the bar while I waited for her. Service at the bar was fine. The bartender was attentive and I had no issues with him. (That's why I'm giving two stars instead of one.)My friend arrived so I cashed out and we got a table. That's when things took a turn for the worse. Our waitress took our food order. I order the shrimp scampi special and my friend ordered the turkey sandwich. About 10 minutes later my friend's turkey sandwich arrives and the waitress leaves without mention of my meal. I'm thinking my food must be on its way. So we wait. And wait. And wait. Where is my food? Where is our waitress? About 15 minutes later she finally comes back to check on us. I'm not sure what the hold up was as there very few people here at this point. \"I ordered the shrimp scampi\" I say. \"Oh, you did? I thought you were just recommending that for your friend.\" Huh? No, that's not at all what happened. Waitress asked what we were having. I said shrimp scampi. My friend said turkey sandwich. It really was that straightforward. \"Oh we had some miscommunication there,\" says the waitress. I do not appreciate the insinuation that I was the one miscommunicating. I am the customer and I am always right. After some back and forth the waitress finally leaves to put in my order. Thanks to the kitchen staff for rushing that one through for me, because at this point I was starving. I inhaled my meal in about two minutes, but the portion was quite insufficient. After leaving, I stopped elsewhere for a much more satisfying dinner number two of the evening. Our waitress did apologize, but at that point it was too late. The experience was ruined.But that's not all. During our meal a woman came by with an iPad asking us to sign up for their rewards program. After explaining that we weren't interested, she moved on to the next table. So I was very surprised this morning to see two emails from the Sedgwick Stop about the new rewards program I joined. I definitely did not sign up for this. I realize that it's 2014 and my email address is connected to my credit card and anything can happen with that information, but really? Is this something new that restaurants and bars are doing, because this has never happened to me before? The email has I have to opt out! What? I never signed up for this...Bottom line: Poor service.

On the other hand - the service is ATROCIOUS. \u00a0I live on Sedgwick St. so I was excited for this place to open as i've walked by the empty space for over a year and was hoping someone would put in an awesome bar. \u00a0Let's walk through all of aspects worthy of discussion:1. \u00a0Atmosphere - Overall it's pretty good. \u00a0The lighting is soft, there are a decent amount of TVs if you're there to watch sports, the bar is friendly and there are quite a few high tables (which I prefer). \u00a0They have these cool lantern lamps that hang from the ceiling, which are neat - but can actually block your view of the tv. \u00a0They haven't quite figured out the music situation either. \u00a0Every time i've been in there, the barkeep will put on his iphone but there is no consistency to the TYPE of music he/they play and sometimes they will just skip to a new song before the previous song has finished. \u00a0It's a bit... indecisive2. Food - Everything I've had has been delicious. \u00a0I am a big fan of the pork sliders! \u00a0I also had the greek salad which was great, as well as the \"Hungry Man\" breakfast sandwich, which is perfect for a hungover weekend brunch. \u00a0They also have great fries.3.Beer - Not much to say here other than the fact that they have a large (and great) selection. Something for everyone, and they are happy to let you sample beers you've never tried.4.Service - Abysmal. \u00a0Unfortunately THIS is the reason I have given Sedgwick Stop 2 stars despite all of the positives I have listed above. \u00a0The service is PAINFULLY slow and the wait staff seems uninformed regarding the menu. \u00a0I've waited this out a bit - hoping it would get better as people settled in to working there, but no dice. \u00a0The first time I was there I was actually holding my empty wine glass outstretched into the aisle and nobody really noticed or cared. \u00a0Their inability to turn drinks around in a timely fashion is mind-boggling and relatively infuriating if you are, ahem, thirsty. I would be less harsh on this point if they were consistently really BUSY but, in actuality, it's usually just a few tables of people when I am in there. \u00a0One Sunday afternoon I walked in and ordered a 312 and it took them 10 minutes (at least) to get it to me. \u00a0Perhaps this doesn't sound that egregious but it should've taken about 30 seconds considering the rest of the waitstaff and bartender were just standing around, and I was only sitting about 7 feet from the bar. The very last point I would like to make is that Sedgwick Stop is definitely expensive. \u00a0Drinks are $1-3 more than they should be, but i guess it evens out since I have about 2-4 FEWER drinks than i normally would given how slow the service is (I feel like I should've put \"ZING\" at the end of that statement, but I'm just being truthful.The place is still relatively new and if they turn this around I will be first in line to be a \"regular\". \u00a0Here's hoping....", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 1, 23]}, "50": {"description": "True story: \u00a0WAY back in the day (ok, 7+ years ago) this was Angelo's Taverna, and I used to work here. \u00a0Not the more recent Angelo's, but the Mediterranean restaurant Angelo's that was right around the corner from the homestead. \u00a0I have not been back since my last day there but always thought the right bar and/or right restaurant would shine here.Sedgwick Stop is not one of them. \u00a0Lots of things are so wrong about this place, and I know they are new, so I am hoping that they can get it right. \u00a0But to highlight a few notables...The service. \u00a0I felt bad for our poor, apologetic waitress, as she seemed like she was either new to serving altogether or just severely in over her head. \u00a0Granted, she did not really have the support system she needed. \u00a0I took a look around the place and noticed the presence of 1 (possible) food runner, 2 bartenders, and another guy just kind of running all over the place. \u00a0It was kind of annoying that there were 2 bartenders tending to a bar of people sitting and casually sipping beverages. \u00a0If it was a college bar with drunk 20-somethings waving Benjamins in your face every 3 seconds trying to buy a bucket of Coors Light, sure, have some extra ammo behind the bar. \u00a0If not, get the bartenders checking on tables. \u00a0As a result, service on the floor suffered. \u00a0Oy vey.The menu. \u00a0Not bad, but pretty limited overall. \u00a0Standard bar fare, including appetizers, sandwiches and large plates. \u00a0I built my own burger for $14.00, which could be a deal or not based on what toppings you choose for your 3. \u00a0I was most appreciative of the fact that you could substitute a salad for fries as a side without an upcharge. \u00a0I never understood why restaurants will charge $1.50+ for a handful of leaves on your plate. \u00a0The drink menu was, really, my biggest issue. \u00a0The list is moderately sized, with several taps and quite a few bottles, and is comprised mainly of local and craft beer selections. \u00a0The first three beers I wanted were out of stock so I had to spend an abnormal amount of time finding one I wanted. \u00a0Most beers were over $6 and, kid you not, I nearly crapped myself when I saw a bottle of Lagunitas Lil Sumpin' Sumpin' was $8. \u00a0EIGHT DOLLARS?! \u00a0Complete highway robbery. \u00a0I am sure it's tough to open a bar and know what to price things, but... wow. \u00a0I think the beer special that night was a $5 312, which is hardly a special. \u00a0I decided on an IPA and it came back with a bit too much head for my liking (and I love head, obviously). \u00a0I am pretty sure I ended up with about 3/4 of a beer once it went down (bahahaha, get it?!).If I were coming to this bar for longer than just a drink and a quick bite I would easily have dropped an excessive amount of money. \u00a0It was a bit of a let down considering there are so many cheaper bars with a better overall experience within 2 blocks. \u00a0But, with anything new, there is hope, so I won't write them off completely just yet. \u00a0Besides, they have that killer patio... if Winter ever ends.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 2, 24]}, "4": {"description": "Great place to catch up with friends and grab drinks.

The party at a neighboring table was served with the wrong pizza, and it was not to their liking, so they apparently left unsatisfied.LIKED: Everything was OK, but not as good as, say, Spacca Napoli.

The sauce they were served in was OK - nothing special. \u00a0The pizza, which we were really forward to wasn't anything special. \u00a0The crust tasted a bit undercooked, not enough cheese (literally half the pizza was bread only) and just overall not satisfying. \u00a0The veal lasagna was OK. \u00a0Lots of meat, but not crazy about the sauce, but again - OK. \u00a0We had one of the salads and that was tasty. \u00a0Now on to the service. \u00a0The food took a long time to come out. \u00a0Meatballs and pizza should not take as long as they did. \u00a0These are Italian staples we've had at MANY restaurants and the food took a long time to come to the table. \u00a0The waitstaff didn't seem to be quite with it. \u00a0We were sharing the lasagna and had to ask for plates to share - they should have just brought out plates or asked if we wanted plates. \u00a0I asked for a side of marinara sauce for the pizza and it took 5 minutes. \u00a0That should be a one minute, run to the kitchen and bring it back thing. \u00a0We also had to ask for silverware replacements after they removed silverware from various courses. If I had not asked I wouldn't have anything to eat my main course with. \u00a0Replacing silverware is \"restaurant 101\" type of stuff. \u00a0 The music was way too loud for the space especially considering how many guests were there. \u00a0I asked multiple times to turn it down and while the music went down for one song, the volume went back up again. \u00a0We gave up asking because we already had asked twice. \u00a0It was impossible for my father-in-law to hear us and we took him to the restaurant special while he was in from out of town. \u00a0Overall, very disappointed and a place I can't recommend and don't see myself coming back to. \u00a0I wish the experience had been better and my wife and I had to apologize to my father-in-law about our restaurant selection. \u00a0Maybe you'll have a better experience than us, and there are other reviewers here who seemed to have had great experiences, but there are a lot of choices on Wells and we'll go with the others at this point unless something changes.Update 5/15/15: \u00a0I emailed the restaurant through their web site and I provided the details from above and no one ever replied to me.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 5, 13]}, "35": {"description": "Went to Dinotto on a snowy Wednesday night. \u00a0I was surprised to see how many seats they were able to slam into a small dining area.

The Pretty Princess was beautiful and pink with pink sprinkles and it was very good. I like X-rated liquer, so this was perfect for me! The Chocoholic was just okay, too strong for me so I gave it to my friend. I liked the Oreos on the rim though. My friends had a bunch of different stuff, including the Carrot Cake, Cappucino, and the Cat's Pajamas. I liked the Cat's Pajamas and I was the odd man out who didn't like the Cappucino cocktail, I'm not much of a coffee drinker though, so that could be it. Cocktails were about $12/each, which wasn't terrible for the amount of booze you were getting. I do wish they had a tiny munchies menu or something, because we ended up walking down the street for food afterwards. It would have been nice to stay in the same place all night. I am giving three stars because in my opinion, ALL the drinks were incredibly strong, which is a good value, but it's not good for just a casual drink. You come here to get drunk. I ordered a Moscow Mule and it was mostly vodka with a tiny hint of ginger. Also, they need to be more honest about their specials. I checked in on Facebook because there was a banner saying that you get 15% if you check in, and when I showed the bartender, he said it was only on weekdays. The banner doesn't say that. Oh well.

It's welcoming from the street, with music and a nice outdoor seating area. We were seated on the second floor. The atmosphere is nice, some of the decorations are a bit cheesy but overall it's a nice space, that's been recently renovated. We were originally seated at a four seat high top table with a party of four. \u00a0We were were a bit cramped and asked if we could switch to a larger booth which included a pour your own beer style tap system. The manager was really welcoming and accommodating. It was barely noon and we were asking them if we could use the booth-side beer tap system and they were more than happy to turn it on and didn't charge us for the initial \"foamy beers\" which was much appreciated. We were torn between breakfast and lunch when we decided to order food. I ended up splitting a breakfast burger and a Mac attack with one of my friends. The breakfast burger was interesting, but good: a burger with bacon, cheese and a fried egg on top, on a French toast bun. The Mac attach burger is what really stole the show though. It was honestly one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Great artisan/pretzel-y type bun, with a nice burger patty, cheese, bacon, of course the Mac and cheese on top and finished off with a Sriracha mayo. We barely spoke once the food was out lol. Woodies is a great spot to grab food and drinks with friends. The service was excellent, as well as the food. The do-it-yourself tap service was a fun novelty that we hadn't seen before. The frosted mugs they give you are a nice touch. The decor and plates could use some changes IMO, but everything is new, comfortable and clean.

There weren't many macaroni noodles on my burger but overall, it was still pretty good. It would have been better with more cheesy macaroni noodles though! The fries though- I did not like them at all. There wasn't much flavor to them and the texture was too crunchy for my taste. I also was not a fan of their fake paper plates and fake solo cup. I thought it was tacky. Also, they made their laminated menus purposely look stained... I don't get why they thought that added character...My hubby got the Big O Burger with fries.

Given the conditions, this may have been a bad idea, but I picked it because all the other places had a much longer waiting time and we had been driving earlier and I figured the roads were practicable enough. The was was listed at 45-60 mins (as opposed to some that were 75-90). Unfortunately, I didn't think about checking Yelp and just wanted to get this done so I could satisfy my savage pizza craving.... Unfortunately, after waiting over an hour and a half, still nothing. We resorted to calling the place, keeping in mind the weather conditions. A lady picked up, and told us that they had a lot of customers given the weather conditions, and that the guy had left so we said that we would wait 20 minutes before cancelling. Half an hour later, we called back. I was hesitant to cancel because I REALLY wanted pizza and didn't want to order from another place and wait another hour. This time a guy picked up, and said the delivery guy left 12 minutes ago. Funny, because half an hour ago we were told he was already gone. But whatever, \"20 more minutes, this is it\", we were told, and so we waited....Another half hour later, this time THEY called us back. I was starting to freak out because the place was now listed as closed for the night on Seamless. Apparently the car got stuck in the snow, so it would be an additional 15 minutes. We hung up, starting to seriously doubt that we were going to eat pizza that night, and about 20 minutes later, as my boyfriend had lost all hope and was taking some food i had cooked out of the fridge, I FINALLY saw a car (by car, I mean a 20 year old beat up Chevy, or something of the kind, no wonder it got stuck in the snow) pull up in front of our residence. His phone rang, and I couldn't believe my ears when the delivery guy asked my boyfriend to come down to his car in the snow and cold to get the pizza!!!! Seriously dude, we ordered DELIVERY, not pick-up, for a reason! As my boyfriend was taking too long to layer up, the guy made it to the door of the building, and my boyfriend met him downstairs so I did not get to express my frustration to the delivery guy, who kept on making more and more excuses from what I heard. Again, I understand the weather conditions, but if you cannot deliver what you advertise, close down for the night. Many places closed for that day because of the conditions, but if you decide to stay open, do NOT lie to your customers repeatedly and make excuses. Notice that at no point their offered a refund or gave us a discount for the wait. I ordered at 7:50 pm, the pizza arrived at 10:35 pm!Now on to the quality of the food. Like I said, I was craving pizza and wanted it fast, so I missed the bad reviews here, but in the two hours I spent waiting, I checked out the latest reviews and was kind of praying that they were wrong...They weren't. The pizza we got after 2 and a half hour was cold, and pretty similar to the picture Lauren A. posted. The fries were lukewarm and soggy, and the cheesy tasted awful. My boyfriend said this was the worst pizza he's ever tasted, and he is pretty big on pizza. As of me, this was probably my worst food experience ever. It really feels like they were trying to use the fact that most people didn't want to go outside in the cold, and that many other places were closed to generate some quick cash while scamming the customers.I waited a few days to post here because I was so furious that night, I didn't want to write on impulse.

Terrible substandard ingredients, even by Chinese takeout standards.

Prior yelp reviews warned me of his probable antics, and he did not disappoint on our visit. He actually slapped a member of our party, and aggressively forced another member to drink straight alcohol by putting the bottle in his mouth and tipping it over. Saw Jimmy deliver several carrot penises to tables throughout the night. With tip the cost of this experience is about $40 a person.

I hit up Lan's this past Saturday night with a big group. They are super helpful to large groups and have it set up so there's a set price (with corking fees) for a family style meal. The total came to just over $30 for the meal and I was really satisfied. We got a ton of delicious food, way too much to list here but the highlight for me was definitely the fabulous garlic shrimp. They were divine and I definitely would be all about going back there just for those shrimp! The service great too. We always had buckets of ice, glasses, etc on the table and they kept the food coming at a perfect pace once they started serving the meal.I cannot complete this review without mentioning the ambiance of Lan's. It looks pretty sketchy from the street but once you're inside it's a modern Chinese restaurant with a great vibe. It's crowded but not too crowded and full of young twenty somethings having a great time and taking advantage of the BYOB. The part that makes Lan's so special is what happens after dinner, when the place launches into a full on karaoke bar.

I've wanted to try the place fora while now, as I've happily shopped at House of Glunz wine and spirits for years and dined at places where the sommalier \u00a0or selection of wines was selected by Glunz. \u00a0When we arrived, there were 2 people at the bar and one other two top when we arrived. Later, a 4 top showed up. \u00a0The place looks cute, with warm cozy wood and stained glass everywhere and lots of old fashioned signs. A lovely old wood bar lines half the front area where there are high top tables and in the back is a small dining room. Our server came over immediately, left us menus, and let us know they were out of the meatloaf and corned beef. This was disappointing on its own account, but as they only serve brunch on Sunday, that was rather limiting. Mr J ordered the burger and I ordered the corned beef hash. I had to ask about how the eggs were served-so I assume had I not, I would have gotten the eggs...? anyway, our server, who never introduced himself, went off to place our ouders, only to return several minutes later (too long, imo) to inform me that there was no corned beef for the hash (which, had I thought about it, that is not a surprise), and leave me with a menu again and a promise to return with our drinks. When he did, I wanted to order the salami sandwich...and he told me they were out of that too. This was getting annoying. I ordered the steak sandwich, and Mr J and I enjoyed our drinks, which were well made prohibition era cocktails. After w rather long wait, our food arrived, and Mr J's burger was juicy and actually quite delicious. It came with hand cut fries and a spicy ailoi and was a real treat. I, on the other hand, had an overdone steak on a hard bun (not toasted, hard), with a chunk of bone that was nearly 1/3 the total size of the steak. Biting into that was an unpleasant surprise. It came with a nicely dressed arugula salad. In the meantime, Mr J ordered a \"waiter's choice\" gin cocktail that was, frankly, not very well made. It was a rifff on a Moscow Mule, but it jsut didn't turn out very well. I'd ordered the Founders Oatmeal stout which was exactly what one would expect. Our server, who had ONE other table checked on us 0 times. Mr J did mention to our unnamed server that his cocktail was underwhelming, and he took off 50% of the cost. \u00a0Overall, the good parts were good, the bad parts were bad, and it seemed as if the whole thing jsut missed the mark. Since we'd heard great things about this place from others and it was kind of close to getting it right, \u00a0this left us thinking that we'd maybe give the place another shot...sometime...not too soon. We exited through the wine shop, and ran into Christopher (whom we later found was the grandson of the original Glunz) who invited us to try the wines opened for the earlier tasting. It happened we found one we quite liked and was quite charming, as he's always been whenever I've been in shopping. He asked us how we liked the meal and we sort of hemmed and hawed and eventually gave him an abbreviated and hopefully less stinging review than the one above. \u00a0 He then apologized profusely, thanked us for our honesty, and explained that the day before, on a Saturday, their head chef just walked out. \u00a0Just like that, left them high and dry and they had been scrambling through the Saturday dinner service and Sunday brunch with the sous-chef and staff trying to work out how to run things. This definitely explained the mis-steps we'd experienced, and I don't think he could have been more genuine in his explanation. I completely understand-sometimes someone just puts the screws to you. We also said we were happy to come again and figured we'd just hit a bad time. He then generously simply GAVE us the bottle of wine were intended to purchase, which more than smoothed over my dissatisfaction. During the conversation, we started talking gin drinks, and ended up purchasing a bottle of nice gin too.

In turn, when we were planning for our rehearsal dinner, this was the first place on our list.Our wedding was on New Years Eve (Thursday), so we inquired about renting out the restaurant on Wednesday (something they normally only do on Mondays), and Barbara (the owner) happily obliged. The planning process with Barbara was both extremely fun and easy. We tried pretty much all the food and a bunch of wine and settled on a set menu of deviled eggs, the class of titans and large German pretzels for appetizers, corned beef gnocchi, cheeseburger or salmon for mains and the tavern sunday or nutella crepes for dessert. We chose an assortment of red, white and bubbly and had our two signature cocktails -- old fashion and glogg as part of our open bar with draft beer. To be honest, we were more excited about our rehearsal dinner food than our wedding food since it struck a cord in both of us as the type of food our families grew up making. The evening of our rehearsal dinner went off without a hitch! Everyone loved the food and drinks and the beautifully ornate and historical atmosphere. Barbara and family even opened up the private tasting room for us to use after the House of Glunz (the wine shop attached to it) closed.

Shortly after you realize that this isn't their only interior designing accomplishment but much more. The bar is surrounded with large tire swing chairs literally hanging from the ceiling. \u00a0The walls are covered top to bottom with some sort of rich oak wood. And they've had custom made neon lights highlighting the bar's rich Midwestern roots. Before even being seated you can tell Happy Camper has a \u00a0huge resemblance in their sister pizza joint, Homeslice. It feels like an Up North Michigan watering hole with a modern sports bar feel to it. Sounds weird but it works all too well. It's safe to say that the creators of Homeslice and Happy Camper know what's up when it comes to interior design and impressing their customers with looks but could the food be as good? I'll be honest I was a little skeptical with Happy Camper when I first read of the new restaurant idea. Not because I didn't think the food was going to be good but this restaurant location has been the home to past disasters like The Refinery which couldn't gain traction. Well that skepticism went out the door quickly when we received our Bloody Mary's which were garnished with a pepperoni pizza slice. Obviously being obsessed with Bloody's and their unique garnishes this was something new to me. I'm always looking for that distinctive taste or garnish to set Bloody Mary's apart and they've succeeded here. The food was also pretty tasty which included great brunch menu items like breakfast pizza, brunch calzone, chicken and waffles, and pork hash. I'd say my favorite was their new chicken and waffle item which came with a homemade honey butter that served more of a dipping sauce than anything. I'd have to give Happy Camper a double thumbs up. This camper they've parked in Old Town is here to stay. If you're in the area and craving some pizza or a beer I highly recommend stopping by.

Just adorable.We were seated in the section closest to the neon Great Lakes sign, and I think I must've taken like 100 photos of it that all looked the same. Anyway...moving on...our server was very attentive throughout the night and gave us really great recommendations for pizza. My favorite was the Marti - sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, feta, garlic, and olive oil. OH MY GOD YUM. We all ordered personal sized pizzas (10\") and shared. Shoot...I wish I could remember our server's name, because he was great. He was wearing flannel...although that probably doesn't narrow it down very much.

Food:- Miso was very good. It was a good portion too.- takoyaki (octopus puff): delish!!! perfectly battered, perfectly juicy inside and perfectly flavored. - Shumai: Our Japanese native friend said this was authentic to what shumai tasted like in her memories. I prefer the Chinese version with yellow skin. - volcano: looks exactly what it sounds like and tastes pretty similar too when you picture ingredients exploding everywhere and mixing together. It was pretty meh for me but when we ordered we knew it was not going to be a roll that you could taste the different layers in.- shiso signature: i had high expectations for this since it was a signature dish. I ended up liking my friend's roll better. Note to self: whenever there are the words \"deep fried\" in a roll description, do not order, unless you are hungover.- sakura (i think): either sakura or whatever roll that has the least amount of condiments/sauces in the description. The fish was fresh and the amount of avacado was just enough to help the food slide into your esophagus.- sears tower: kudos to the restaurant for keeping it sears towers instead of Willis tower. Taste-wise, I could care less coz the presentation was just priceless. We came up with various interpretations of what they looked like. You'll have to see it for yourself.

Sears Tower-- OH MY WORD. I could eat like five of these in one sitting. The whole has cream cheese, crab, clinator, asparagus, and unagi. Then it's deep fried, stacked up to look like a tower, and then drizzled with sweet sauce. Seriously, heavenly. A MUST TRY.2. Mexican -- deep fried shrimp, avaocado, masago, jalapeno, and cilantro, covered with unagi sauce. I am not a fan of spicy food, but this is amazing. 3. Tiger -- deep fried soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, masago mayo, topped with tamago and unagi sauce. So yummy.The waitresses are always super friendly and nice. They don't mind if you're there for a long, just hanging out and catching up with friends. The bill is always pretty decent too!

This stuff is \u00a0INCREDIBLE. I have to be honest here. I can bake. I can bake anything, but cooking, well... It's a whole different skill set. Back of The Yards adds a great flavor my meat and chicken dishes were missing. On my latest journey into the store, I happened to pick up a jar of the Sunny Paris, Salt-free seasoning. This has been a gift from the gods for my homemade soups! It also is a great flavoring on vegetables. The salt-free option rocks my world. \u00a0Why consume extra salt?I could go on and on and on but I think it's clear. This place spices my world- from the help, to the smells, to the products-it is all around wonderful! If you are not local \u00a0or can't easily make it to the store itself, the website is pretty great!* the stairs in front are not steep but can be a bit of a challenge to those using walking devices.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 13]}, "18": {"description": "One of the most fragrant places in all the land.

He immediately apologized and offered the refund (apology appreciated, refund expected).

My friend declined, but I haven't gotten my hair cut in an embarrassingly long time, and didn't feel like going to the suburbs to get my hair cuit by my normal lady, so I got it. It seemed like a good deal for $50, and it was close to my apartment, so why not? WHY NOT I SAID. The deal offers a number of services, but I am a simple girl of simple tastes and have had the same haircut for like 7 years. How hard can it be to trim side bangs and cut/layer 2-3 inches of hair?The girl at reception was great, and when I was a few minutes late, she was super nice about it. An assistant washed my hair, and then I was sitting and waiting for my hair cutter to come. Everything seemed normal.My hair person was extremely friendly, and I felt good about having her cut my hair. She didn't cut it in the same way that I was used to, so I couldn't really see how much she was cutting or where she was cutting, but we had a nice conversation and she seemed to have a lot of experience, so I wasn't too worried. BUT, after she dried my hair, I looked at the mirror and started experiencing an anxiety attack.Okay, my hair is extremely fine (fine as in thin, not fine as in beautiful, because it is certainly not beautiful right now). It does weird ugly-wavy things when you dry it because it's so thin, so it's imperative that I straighten it every day. I understand that, and I think anyone who touches my hair understands that. It was looking strange, so my hair person suggested she flat iron it first, and then we could go from there. I nervously agreed.However, after flat ironing it, I told her to cut about half an inch from my bangs (because she had barely touched them and they had been growing for SIX MONTHS), which is a normal length for me to get cut, but it looked horrible. After cutting a little, she \"layered\" the bangs, which then became choppier. I don't even know how it came to be this way. It was a terrible force of nature. She then tried putting pomade into my bangs to style it the way I usually do, but it just looked worse and worse with too much pomade, and by the time I left, my bangs looked like a bad rendition of Danny Zuko's hair, Grease-style. Except maybe Grease 2.I know she felt bad, but my bangs were too short to try to cut more/fix. And I felt bad for her feeling bad. But actually, my bad is worse than her bad because I have to live with this. So I thanked her, tipped her, then rushed home to wash, dry, and try to fix my hair. I came home and did everything I could but what's done has been done and I cannot undo it, and all I can do now is sadly write this long yelp entry, and grow my hair out until I can return to my regular lady in the suburbs. Maybe this was my fault because I didn't specify (but I thought everyone who cuts hair does this?), but she didn't thin the ends of my hair at all, and now it looks like someone just took a pair of scissors and cut straight across my hair, except that there are uneven ends so maybe a someone with shaky hands. I had to cut random strands when I got home, not that it did much to salvage it. The bangs are choppy and so short that I begin to hyperventilate when thinking about them.To answer my original question, apparently it is extremely hard to trim side bangs and cut/layer 2-3 inches of hair. I don't know much about hair, but I do know that what I ask for is not much. It usually takes people less than 30 minutes to cut my hair, but somehow, it took over an hour here. I hate to give such a terrible review because everyone was so friendly, which is why I am giving more than 1 star.

It is such an unprofessional environment and for the cost and final product, there are better places in Chicago.STYLING:At first, I loved Swerve. My stylist, who I won't name for reasons that will become obvious below, was awesome and I even let her highlight my hair for the first time in my life which I had always said I would never do. But over time, the way she cut my hair really thinned it out, and oddly made it triangular around my face. Two years later, I'm starting to get the fullness back, but it's not fully recovered yet. I should also mention that of the 4-5 people I referred there during the time I was a client, no one ever went back for a second trip, so they must have had a \u00a0negative or lackluster experience as well. Also, the first time my stylist did my highlights, they were great, but the price was more than twice the price that the website listed for highlights at the time because they were \"custom\". This is my bad for not asking first, but seriously, over twice the top price quoted? Come on. For reference, I just looked at the current price for \"custom\" on the site, and mine were about 60% more expensive than that. Then, the second time, she pretty much just slapped on some dye so that I had obvious, rectangular chunks of color strewn about my head. Not cool. Had to get it fixed elsewhere.RAGING UNPROFESSIONALISM:My stylist once laughed while telling me about how she'd run out of the right color of red dye while doing a full color on the customer before me, so she'd just mixed a different color to finish the back of the person's head. Isn't step one of any process in life \"Figure out if I have the requisite tools to complete this project?\" And then, if you're going to flake out on doing something the right way, you're going to TELL ANOTHER CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW YOU LITERALLY JUST JACKED UP ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S HAIR AND DON'T EVEN CARE?!?!? It gets better though! My stylist also put me in the middle of a conflict between Swerve and a friend of mine that I'd referred to Swerve. As background, the front desk staff at Swerve are horrible. They've tried to call me to schedule something and then won't call me back when they drop the call mid-conversation, they've lost appointments, failed to call to confirm appointments, etc. In keeping with this trend, Swerve attempted to charge a friend of mine a no-show fee for an appointment that she'd never made and that, when they called her to confirm, she affirmatively canceled. It escalated to the point where she had to cancel her credit card because of multiple charge attempts by Swerve. But instead of calling my friend directly to apologize for the misunderstanding and try to make it right (which probably would have worked), my stylist put me in the middle of it by asking me to talk to my friend to urge her to come back to my stylist despite the poor front desk experience! How awkward is that?!?! She pretty much laid out a script for me of what to say to my friend on her behalf. It was so bizarre. This is your business, not mine.FALSE ADVERTISING:At one point, Swerve ran a promotion giving you $100 to the salon for any friend you referred. The fine print said that the credit had to be used towards services, which I was fine with. I ended up referring three friends during the promotion period, who all confirmed to me that they'd visited with my stylist after they'd done so. When I tried to cash in on the credit, though, my stylist told me that only two of them had visited. I decided not to push the issue. Then, when I received the credits, they were in $25 increments, could only be used one per visit, and all 8 expired within 3 months of issuance. In other words, I basically only got a $25 credit. When I called, Swerve did at least extend one coupon for me so that I could take advantage of $50 of the $200 I should have gotten. So beware, their promotions probably aren't as good as they say.So that's Swerve.

The haircut seemed to go well, but after I washed my hair myself, my hair become unmanageable. It was obvious that the hair stylist did not know how to cut curly hair. In fact, he straightened my hair at the end and cut some more off to see if he did everything right. When I got my hair cut at another salon a couple of months later, the hair stylist asked who cut my hair because it was not cut well. On top of that, they try to push products on you and push you into scheduling appointment for months in advance and claim they will remind you a week before. I never got a reminder a week before about an appointment I was forced to book and frankly did not want to book. When I got a reminder the day off (the only reminder) and tried to cancel, I was told I would have to pay a $24 cancellation fee. \u00a0Avoid this place at all costs.

It is so convenient for me, just up the street from my apartment. After reading all the yelp reviews, I was excited to give it a try. I made an appointment and was randomly assigned to Mandi. I was there for a deep conditioning treatment and a haircut. The other salons I've been to do the deep conditioning treatment differently - they add the conditioner after shampooing, then they covered the hair with a cap or wrap or something and you sit under the dryer to heat up the conditioner and let it work it's magic. At Swerve, I think I just paid an extra $18 for them to use a different brand of conditioner, that was in my hair for 3.5 seconds before being rinsed out. For the cut, I wanted a trim and bangs, and to be specific I brought several pictures of a well-known celebrity to clarify exactly how I wanted it to look. Mandi started the cut by having me stand, and trimming my hair when it was wet. Then, she had me sit in the chair and dried my hair before continuing to cut it AFTER it was dry. She said something about internal layers to give it more shape. She also didn't want to give me the bangs like the celebrity pics, since she said my hair was too curly, so I just ended up with a really awkward short layer toward the front, about the length of my chin.This fell short of the mark, and I've never had split ends so quickly after a haircut.

I understand the policy.At that first missed appointment I asked that they actually confirm the appointment. \u00a0Like, talk to me. \u00a0Or email with me, or text me. \u00a0The answer was No.I spoke with the manager and owner and their software doesn't support email or text and they don't think it it practical to actually talk to someone before considering an appointment confirmed. \u00a0Okay, noted... I will need to be more vigilant about checking voicemails left by the salon. \u00a0Besides it was anomaly that would probably never happen again.Skip to a couple months later and I started sharing my calendar with my co-workers and removed my salon appointments. \u00a0I thought I moved it to another calendar, but apparently I screwed it up. \u00a0Doah!! \u00a0So I missed another appointment and they charged me another $75. \u00a0Okay, ouch but I knew better that is my fault.The kicker is that after year and years of religiously reliable appointments now they tell me they won't book my appointments in advance any longer. \u00a0Are you kidding me!?!?!I guess this salon has grown so much and so big that they don't need the reliable long-term customers that helped them build their business or to actually provide the high-quality level of service that they certainly charge for. $$$$$Bummer", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 10, 5]}, "55": {"description": "I had a brazilian wax here weeks ago when I was visiting with family, so it was my first time at Swerve, and in that neighborhood in general.To begin, the salon was one of the cleanest I have visited EVER.

It is such an unprofessional environment and for the cost and final product, there are better places in Chicago.STYLING:At first, I loved Swerve. My stylist, who I won't name for reasons that will become obvious below, was awesome and I even let her highlight my hair for the first time in my life which I had always said I would never do. But over time, the way she cut my hair really thinned it out, and oddly made it triangular around my face. Two years later, I'm starting to get the fullness back, but it's not fully recovered yet. I should also mention that of the 4-5 people I referred there during the time I was a client, no one ever went back for a second trip, so they must have had a \u00a0negative or lackluster experience as well. Also, the first time my stylist did my highlights, they were great, but the price was more than twice the price that the website listed for highlights at the time because they were \"custom\". This is my bad for not asking first, but seriously, over twice the top price quoted? Come on. For reference, I just looked at the current price for \"custom\" on the site, and mine were about 60% more expensive than that. Then, the second time, she pretty much just slapped on some dye so that I had obvious, rectangular chunks of color strewn about my head. Not cool. Had to get it fixed elsewhere.RAGING UNPROFESSIONALISM:My stylist once laughed while telling me about how she'd run out of the right color of red dye while doing a full color on the customer before me, so she'd just mixed a different color to finish the back of the person's head. Isn't step one of any process in life \"Figure out if I have the requisite tools to complete this project?\" And then, if you're going to flake out on doing something the right way, you're going to TELL ANOTHER CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW YOU LITERALLY JUST JACKED UP ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S HAIR AND DON'T EVEN CARE?!?!? It gets better though! My stylist also put me in the middle of a conflict between Swerve and a friend of mine that I'd referred to Swerve. As background, the front desk staff at Swerve are horrible. They've tried to call me to schedule something and then won't call me back when they drop the call mid-conversation, they've lost appointments, failed to call to confirm appointments, etc. In keeping with this trend, Swerve attempted to charge a friend of mine a no-show fee for an appointment that she'd never made and that, when they called her to confirm, she affirmatively canceled. It escalated to the point where she had to cancel her credit card because of multiple charge attempts by Swerve. But instead of calling my friend directly to apologize for the misunderstanding and try to make it right (which probably would have worked), my stylist put me in the middle of it by asking me to talk to my friend to urge her to come back to my stylist despite the poor front desk experience! How awkward is that?!?! She pretty much laid out a script for me of what to say to my friend on her behalf. It was so bizarre. This is your business, not mine.FALSE ADVERTISING:At one point, Swerve ran a promotion giving you $100 to the salon for any friend you referred. The fine print said that the credit had to be used towards services, which I was fine with. I ended up referring three friends during the promotion period, who all confirmed to me that they'd visited with my stylist after they'd done so. When I tried to cash in on the credit, though, my stylist told me that only two of them had visited. I decided not to push the issue. Then, when I received the credits, they were in $25 increments, could only be used one per visit, and all 8 expired within 3 months of issuance. In other words, I basically only got a $25 credit. When I called, Swerve did at least extend one coupon for me so that I could take advantage of $50 of the $200 I should have gotten. So beware, their promotions probably aren't as good as they say.So that's Swerve. I found a new place that I'm super happy at and will never go back.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 2, 17]}, "36": {"description": "This review is for Brooke who gave me a facial last night.Brooke was AMAZING! \u00a0She not only have me an amazing facial, but she also gave me a foot massage and wrapped them in hot towels. \u00a0She also gave me a shoulder / decolletage massage while I had a mask on my face and I was in heaven. \u00a0I would highly suggest Brooke!My only complaint is that the facial room is located where everyone checks in and buys product, so you could hear quite a bit of noise. \u00a0However, the darkness of the room and the music that was on, seemed to drown out the noise quite a bit.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 3, 21]}, "14": {"description": "I would be lost without Jenn!

I guess because they have experienced snobbery, or maybe because they don't like how big the company has gotten to be. Then there are people who have never heard of such a company, like a lady I know that lived in Chicago for a few years. And still others adore Intelligentsia. I personally like them quite well. The few times that I've been to an Intelli, I've never been snobbed, so I can't complain about that. And I love them for what they've done in the coffee world. Ah, yes. And it seems like I always enjoy the coffee they make for me. Now for this particular experience. Intelligentsia seemed like an appropriate start for my Chicago coffee tour, since Chicago is where Intelligentsia originated. Also it was the most convenient place to obtain caffeine at the moment. I walked in and was greeted by the fresh vibe that is Intelligentsia. A jolly, bill-capped barista with a nice beard brewed me up an exprexxo. (There is no X in espresso but there are three Xs in exprexxo.) I sat down on a nearby construction avocado green chair and tried it out. It was the best espresso I'd had that day. Of course.

The story of Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea, the coffee roasting company that runs this Old Town and a handful of other coffee bars in Chicago, LA, and NY, is essentially akin to that of the 19th century social stratum as the coffee roasting company experimented with buying, roasting, and brewing techniques and adopted a business philosophy that bore little relationship to the received categories in coffee business--the then two-tier system constituted of gas station store's coffee and Starbucks coffee. They therefore, like their namesake social category, added a new class to the two-tier system and with some other roasting companies started the Third Wave Coffee movement. Their efforts have been well paid off as they turned into one of the \"Big Three of Third Wave Coffee.\"Much digital and real ink has been spilled lauding the awesomeness of Intelligentsia coffee's taste and aroma. I agree with them all. I am by no means a coffee expert; but when I go to a third-wave coffee place for the first time, I usually get an espresso to try and see if I can tell any difference. What I drank at Old Town Intelligentsia was for sure different, in a good way, from what I had in other places. I even had Intelligentsia coffee before at Angry Catfish Bicycle and Coffee Bar in Minneapolis. It's maybe a delusion; but I think this original Intelligentsia Coffee Bar's espresso was better than that of Angry Catfish which brews the same beans. Add to their exceptionally good coffee some nice baristas, a modern yet comfortable interior design, high-speed wifi connection, a gorgeous espresso machine--which itself is an amazing piece of industrial design--and delicious pastries and you will get a first-rate third wave coffee bar.Although Lenin and his Bolshevik Party were perhaps the most famous representatives of intelligentsia, he famously criticized the social stratum of which he was a member for being lackeys of capitalism. In fact, in a letter to Gorky, he once wrote that the intelligentsia is not the nation's brain; it's the nation's feces. The Intelligentsia coffee bar too, although an amazing place serving excellent coffee, doesn't assist the \"cause of working class!\" (After all, shouldn't third wave coffee be served in independently owned coffee shops--and not chains?)

All I can tell you was that she was medium height, brunette, on the heavier side, and had dramatically drawn on eyebrows.First of all, let me tell you that I'm a loyal EWC customer. I have a wax pass, and always go to their locations for my waxing. I should also tell you that I have awesome eyebrows. They have a gentle arch, really full, very similar to Camilla Belle. Today, I was late for my appointment. Totally my fault, and they were nice enough to fit me in. I should have known better, and just taken a later appointment. The wax specialist was in a huge rush to try and get me in and out and it was TERRIBLE. She asked me how my day was going THREE TIMES in a row. I told her my eyes always water when I get waxed, and not to worry about it. She responded with, \"you better not be f**king crying on my table.\" And when she showed me the mirror afterwards, one of my brows was completely thinned out and re-shaped! Suddenly I had this skinny little shred of an eyebrow with this crazy forced arch. She fully acknowledged that one of them was thinner than the other, but just said- \"yea, one came out thinner. But your eyebrows are hot.\" I had no time to do anything about it, because I was already late in their schedule. So I just had to leave and I figured it was probably not that noticeable. It was totally noticeable. I've now just spent 20 minutes in the bathroom plucking the other eyebrow to match this one and it breaks my heart to see my beautiful, full, eyebrows destroyed like this!

When I got there, the woman at the front desk let me know of a membership - if you're new, you can buy 9 waxes and get 3 free for a total of 12. It was a little over $400, but they offered PAYMENT PLANS which is awesome - so your credit card only gets charged $140ish over 3 months. Easier pill to swallow than upfront. I told her I would get my wax and then consider.Nicole did my brazilian and it was hands down the best and most painless brazilian I have ever had done! I thought that I was never going to leave my old waxing place but she had me sold. I was in and out of the room in about 10 minutes and she walked me through all the products she was using on me (cooling gel, etc) and told me about the signature blue wax that isn't supposed to grab onto the skin and is painless. I didn't believe her at first but it truly was painless...I ended up buying the wax package so now I have 12 more brazilians to use - and they don't expire! Some places you have to go monthly but my hair doesn't grow quite as fast so I go once every 5-6 weeks.They do push their products a little bit - I bought some of the ingrown hair serum because Nicole was talking it up - but so far it's been great and I don't regret buying it at all.If you live in the area and need a place to get a wax done, you should absolutely check this place out!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 9, 11]}, "14": {"description": "Becca is excellent at her job and puts you at ease.

The three or four other tables that we didn't take up for our party filled up and the takeout business was brisk. How our waitress did it all (seating, taking orders, taking phone orders, delivering food, etc.) and did it well and with a friendly smile was quite remarkable. All of our food arrived accurately and was hot.We had thai iced tea and coffee for drinks, which was pretty typical for a Thai restaurant. And we tried their strawberry smoothie, which was a little on the watery side but tasty. It looks like a BYOB place, as another table had brought in some wine. The restaurant provides wine glasses.The food was delicious! We had spring rolls, fried Thai rolls, and crab rangoon for appetizers, which were all hot and very tasty. My young niece and nephew had appetizers for their meals (shrimp rolls and chicken satay). As another reader noted, the sweet and spicy sauce for the shrimp rolls was great! For entrees we had a variety of dishes, from red and panang curries with chicken and shrimp to drunken noodles with shrimp, pad see yoo with chicken, garlic basil with tofu, and one of the daily noodle specials (with a yellow curry sauce). Everyone really liked their dishes. Even my boyfriend who had never eaten Thai enjoyed the entire meal (outside of the curries, which is a taste he does not like). I had the panang curry, and it stood up with some of the best I've had. The sauce was delicate but spicy and nutty.

When I walked in, I saw the same man who had previously cut my hair and totally botched my bangs waiting at the counter, and I cringed in fear. How can someone mess up two times in a row, right? Typically I cut my own bangs in between haircuts because they grow so stinking fast, so as he called my name, I figured I would give him a chance for redemption as they were getting pretty long. It really isn't difficult. If I can do it, a paid professional should be able to. WRONG. So as I sat down in the chair, I pulled off my winter hat (it's freezing out) and he began cutting my hair... Did not brush it out, did not fix my part, nothing... Just began chopping away. I knew I was screwed. Then a women came up to him as he was cutting my hair and asked if he would be able to fix her daughter's hair because he did not cut her bangs as she wanted. This should have been my sign to run immediately, but I did not. He agreed to fix them after he was done with mine. Once he had finished cutting my hair, which is about an inch longer on the right side, he moved towards my bangs. He asked how long I wanted them, and I told him they are usually touching the lowest point of my eyebrows. The finished product? The right side of my bangs were bluntly chopped above my right eyebrow. The left side of my bangs actually looked pretty decent, but a little long, below my eyebrow. Looking in the mirror, I told him they looked fine, as there was no way that man would be coming near my head with scissors ever again. I paid for my haircut and immediately put on my hat to leave. Then I looked over to see the girl crying about her hair as she got in his chair to get her own bangs \"fixed\". I went home and immediately fixed my bangs. They're still extremely short, but he is lucky they grow fast. Someone seriously needs to give this man a lesson in cutting bangs. Not only has he messed up mine, but I'm sure that poor little girl's bangs looked equally as bad when he was done with her.All-in-all, my bangs were way shorter on the right side than the left, and the rest of my hair was an inch longer on the right side than on the left, making for one awesome haircut.

Adorned with rich mahogany woods (much of which was re-purposed from historic Chicago buildings such as the pillars behind the bar from Chicago's well known Como Inn) plenty of nice high top tables, and a stunning mahogany main bar- this is a truly visually pleasing Irish pub atmosphere.Old Town is a hot neighborhood with a healthy event, bar & nighlife scene so the place (and every-other even half-way decent place in Old Town) can get a bit too crowded for the personal taste of some... but you can't really hold thriving business or being crowded during an event or holiday against a place.There is a second bar and private party room on the second floor, a full kitchen (although a limited menu for the late-night crowd) frequent drink specials, clean bathrooms, and trivia nights. \u00a0TIP: \u00a0Try the fried pickles & the burgers are one of the best in Chicago.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 4, 6]}, "3": {"description": "Went in for a martini, told the woman at the bar what I wanted and she ordered me outside to a table and said someone would be right out.

I waited outside for about 5 minute and when no one showed up I left. Its a Monday night for crying out loud and you clearly were busy chatting and not paying attention to customers (which one of those things are you geting paid to do?)I wasn't about to keep waiting because if one of those servers had showed up 10 minutes later how long would I have been sitting there like a lemon waiting for my martini after I placed the order? Sorry but your lazy behavior cost you a good tip on a slow night. I wallked down the street, had a great martini and nice chat with another bartender (who didn't order me outside), paid $10 and left a $5 tip on top. Its not that hard to do a good job serving food or drinks -- you just have to be serious about your work. I know, I used to do it. Of course I'm not 100% sure what the problem was. Perhaps the whole deal was a communication issue, or maybe something went wrong the minute I stepped out the door and they were all called somewhere else to respond to a huge emergency.

It definitely was the opposite as it was very heated and more guests filled up the area quickly. The wine menu is plentiful leaving no one unaccommodated. The food menu is in Italian however the descriptions are in English. I advise you learn a bit of Italian pronunciation before coming if you want to appear well versed. The food portions are surprisingly filling given my preconceived notions that most pasta dishes leave you hungry. The prices fluctuate between $15 and $26, a good price range.

The owner told us the substition would cost additional 2.50 and we accepted this although it marked the first time in our lengthy experience a surcharge was demanded. Since we already were paying overage, we requested a few slices extra mozzarella with another surcharge. The owner went ballistic, telling us that 2-3 slices of mozzarella would cost us 12.80 per salad because it amounts to an appetizer. (I believe he contemplated the caprese salad.)We declined the second surcharge, told the owner to put the original mozzarella substitution on our salads and I would walk to the nearby Treasure Island and buy a tub of fresh, large buffalo mozzarella balls imported from Italy there. (These sell for less than 1.00 for a very large and authentic ball, so for a dollar or two plus ten minutes time it made sense.)At this notification, the owner terminated our relationship. Please know that at no time did we display poor manners, loud tone or any other behavior a reasonable person would construe as rudeness towards the owner or anybody else at the restaurant.

Came here with my family from overseas, they had just arrived and I had booked this place due to the fact some of them were staying locally and this restaurant was relatively close by for the first night. Me and my wife had been here some time ago, it wasn't particularly memorable the first time, but I didn't have any negative memories. Now I do.After we had finished our delicious meal, the bill came, we paid up in cash. Our waiter asked me if I'd like change. Now not knowing exactly how much I was going to tip I said \"yes please\". I could tell he was disappointed, so I made sure to look over the amount again upon its return and tip accordingly.I put in 15%. There were 6 people and I didn't think he really deserved 20%, I think 15% is more than adequate for lets just say, \"adequate\" service. I'm more than happy to take care of a waiter/waitress who goes above and beyond, this guy did not. He wasn't bad (not yet), but he wasn't 20%.Whilst we were all still seated, he took away the tip. After that, I could see him pacing around our area looking at the tip we'd given. This struck me as odd and I almost thought he was going to come over to complain about it. Well, my gut was right, he approached me and proceeded to say that this was far to low a tip amount and that he usually receives no less that 18-20%! I was stunned. I said \"what is the problem exactly? i don't think it's less than you deserve and I certainly think it's more than enough\". He protested once again that it wasn't enough and that he can't even pay the bus boys with this. He threw the tip back on the table and stormed off. At this point I was totally offended. I explained what had happened to my wife and to my family, said that we should leave but not before I speak to the manager. I got to the host and asked to speak to the manager, he brought him over. I explained the situation and what had happened, he apologized, I said \"I'm going to give you two options; I can give him the tip or I can leave and give him nothing, I don't believe that we deserved to be spoken to like that and I'm frankly very insulted in the way he basically threw the tip back at me\". Right at this moment our waiter came over and started to repeat that the tip wasn't enough and basically get into an argument with us right at the host stand in the middle of the restaurant. The manager was waaay out of his depth here and literally couldn't handle the situation, he basically stood there not able to do or say anything. In fairness, he looked about 18 years old and very green. So, we simply ended the discussion right there, took his tip and left. I've never experienced anything like this dining out before. But this one guy ruined the first night with my family. I feel bad for the bus boys, this guy cost them their tip just because he'd rather throw a 15% tip back as opposed to accepting it. I gave him the opportunity to take it back, even after he threw it back at me. His pride was obviously more important.Will never go here again.

We started ordering from them about a year ago, and we have had very few bad experiences over that time. And if there's something wrong, they try to make it right or credit you for the next time. The worst (which became the best) time was the most recent. When our pizza hadn't arrived after 1 hour and 15 minutes, I called to see where it was. I spoke to Janice and she informed me that there had basically been a major kitchen/delivery mix up and they were about 8 pizzas behind. I was very aggravated because I had taken my digestive enzyme pills (I'm lactose intolerant) to counteract the time when I would've been eating the pizza. Not only was I was starving out of my mind, but now I would have to take a double amount of pills because the pizza still wouldn't be there for another 45 minutes! \u00a0She was profusely apologetic, and told me she'd give me a credit for a pizza next time, and I told her \"No thank you, because I will almost certainly not reorder from you guys again because of this.\" She told me that she refused to lose me as a customer for Papa John's and that she would like to comp the pizza that would soon be on its way AND keep the credit for next time. She also told me she had just called in different delivery drivers from all over the city to try to come help and speed up the process. Obviously, it was very nice for her to offer those things, but the real reason I will return is because she clearly cared about me as a customer and DID NOT just pass it off as an \"oh well! Who cares? It isn't my company.\" And she was a problem solver: attempting to correct the issue trying to speed it up as much as possible by calling all available drivers! She treated my business as if it were her own. She is an asset to that location. I have a feeling if they keep her and only other employees like her around: customers will be more satisfied, yelp reviews will increase, employee morale will go up and they'll want to continue to see their work praised, service quality all around goes up, and their sales will increase. Everyone wins!! AND the pizza is always good, but it was particularly \u00a0delicious that night. The night went from zero to hero pretty quickly.

Coupled with the fact that this place also does blow-outs and up-dos, it was the perfect fit for what I needed. Jessica R did my make-up. She's fantastic and would always check to see how I was liking things and whether I wanted to change anything (e.g. lighter or darker eye shadow? thicker or thinner eyeliner? etc). She is an absolute pro at all things make-up, and applying falsies in particular. Make-up application is $50, but if you buy $50 of product at Arch, they waive the application fee - super nifty, and I left with 2 lip glosses. They have a lovely selection of high-end (but not mainstream) make-up brands in-store.Another Jessica did my blow-out (and I completely forgot her last name - forgive me!). Hair was washed to a squeaky clean, and she managed to magically put soft curls in my hair that held all night. Such an impressive feat!Can't wait to come back here again.

Beyond being a great alternative to getting burned by the sun or getting microwaved in a tanning booth, the spray tan results looked way better than I expected (it was my first time!). The staff there are super friendly and work with exact precision to not only match you up with the right level of tan you're looking to obtain, but to also spend a good amount of time making sure they hit every spot.

The sandwich was really, really oily (which some people like) and overall just kinda disappointing. It was over-fried, floppy, and looked and tasted like something I could have made at home. In essence it was nothing more than a glorified grilled cheese with meat that I paid $7 for. The potato wedges were similar. They were cooked the right amount but they were drowned in oil and garlic. As for the service, it really let me down. The restaurant provides endless warm bread, which was really tasty, but for some reason the server brought out grated cheese with it. I asked for olive oil the next time he came by but he never brought it out, even though he acknowledged that he understood my request. In my opinion, an Italian restaurant should be stocked with olive oil, and the killer thing is that I saw a bottle of it right through the window (since we were sitting outside). But alas, my olive oil never came. Our \"main server,\" who actually took our order and got our bill, was too casual and acted as if he could have done without our business.

I created a yelp account just to review this place.First, let me preface this by saying this review is on the customer service provided. I work at a hotel downtown at the front desk and frequently have guests ask me where to order from. I gave him a menu from Downtown pizza and helped him place the order as he had a speech impediment. I called and ordered the two Pizzas for the guest and while I was on the phone I asked the woman for an estimate on how long it would take and she said 45 minutes.About an hour, hour 15 goes by and the food still has not arrived. I called back and asked for an update and was told that the food has been made but that they are just waiting on the driver. 45 minutes later the driver shows up at the hotel. I called back and spoke with the woman again and told her that I did not think that it was acceptable that it took an hour and 45 minutes to have the pizzas delivered. When I reminded her that she told me it would only take 45 minutes she said \"that was just for the pizza's being cooked, but since he ordered two pizzas (one small and one large) it would take longer\" I then started to explain to her that I understand if it gets busy, but it would have been nice if they had called the guest to inform him that they would be running late. In the middle of me explaining this to her she abruptly hands the phone to who I assume was the manager. While I was re-explaining the situation to him and said that the guest should be given a discount for the inconvenience of having to wait almost two hours for the pizza. He then replied that the price that was given was a fair price and that he would not change it. In the middle of me explaining to him why I do not think that it is fair, he puts the phone down and I hear him answer another phone. He never once asks me to hold on; he just abruptly puts the phone down. I felt really bad for the delivery guy because he was just standing there while this was all going on. At this point the guest is upset because he is hungry and it is two in the morning he just wants to tell the delivery guy to take the pizza back. I hung up the phone and call him back. I told him that I do not appreciate being placed on hold without giving any warning. He then goes on to say \"well, I'm sorry I don't know what you want me to say, we do the best we can we will do better next time\" I then explain that it is still not fair that this guest had to wait two hours when we were only told 45 minutes. Again, while I am in the middle of explaining he hangs up on me. I call back, irate at this point and start to tell him that this is not okay to hang up on a customer and that it is really bad customer service. While I am saying that I hear the woman in the background say \"she called back again?\". I continue explaining what I am saying when he again just hangs up on me. We finally just have the delivery driver call and say that the guest is only going to give him 50% of the total, exasperated the owner must have agreed. The guest gave the deliveryman a tip and he left after apologizing for the entire ordeal.As this was for a guest, I do not know how the food was, from the customer service alone however, I will not be recommending this place to any guest again. I really was not looking for the guest to have a free meal. I was just maybe hoping that they would understand the issue and give the guest a 10% discount and apologize.

I could have reached and grabbed my money out of her hand but my mother raised me better than that.

Can you believe the nerve of me...to want to purchase an additional item from a business that in fact offers that particular item. I really owe that woman an apology.I wish I could say my bad experience ended there. Upon receiving my food, I tried to put the encounter behind me and sit down to eat. I placed my food on the table and went to grab a fork for the potato salad. When I returned to sit down, my now favorite employee has picked up the broom everyone coming in the store had to step over and told me she was sweeping the area \u00a0(which included the table I had my opened food on).

It offers hot dogs, Polish, Italian beef, pizza puffs and a few other classic Chicago quick bites. The food looks and tastes fresh and non-greasy. Service is pleasant and fast enough. The seating area is modest but relatively clean and not sticky or smelly.Dog House Grill is located in the space formerly occupied by Fresh Start, which was a health-conscious fast food takeout joint. I miss Fresh Start, however, Dog House Grill is appreciated, particularly given it keeps late night hours.I have eaten two Chicago dogs, one Polish and one Italian beef here. All appeared fresh, and the toppings and condiments were abundant. However, the dogs were missing celery salt and that's a sin in Chicago; otherwise they were authentic. The Italian beef was placed on Turano bread, and it was juicy and peppery, but the deep beefy flavor you get at famous beef stands was lacking. It was good though.I give Dog House Grill four stars because for what it is, essentially a Vienna factory outlet, this stand is the best in the area. On good weather days, I might leave Old Town for superior versions of the same genre food.[Edited 2-28-15: \u00a0Ordered a double cheeseburger and fries today. My usual burger - salt, pepper, pickles and ungrilled onions. The bun appeared to be a floured Turano potato one and it was moist as well as non-fake tasting; the meat was 5/8 lb and better tasting than Five Guys and local pub beef; the pickles contributed and did not distract; the onions were fresh sliced reds; the American cheese was your basic American, but the cook placed an extra slice on top and it was not completely melted in the center. Not a Butcher and The Burger burger experience but delicious and filling nevertheless.The fries stood out. These had some skin on them and were the puffy non-heavy higher end variety. Notably better than you typically would find at Butcher and The Burger or in Old Town. Quite potato-ey yet light and non-greasy. The fries were perfectly golden, snappy on the outside and, as stated, puffy on the inside. They were not heavily salted and didn't need it, I used very little ketchup because the fries themselves tasted good on their own and I ate majority plain.The food here is non-greasy or heavy for what it is.

One was to request a schedule change b/c a nail technician quit (TMI) and the second was to confirm. I agreed to push my appointment back by 1 hour. I showed up 20 minutes early and planned on reading a magazine. When I announced my name the technician goes, what did I tell you? Ok. That was rude. I knew I was early, but I wanted to relax and read a magazine. That was a bit of a problem, because there wasn't a waiting room. Fortunately, I was able to jump in early. I went to pick out my mail polish color and all of them were practically empty. In fact, there wasn't much to choose from. Is this salon doing so poorly that they can't make sure their colors are in stock? That was a bit strange.I was told to go sit on a bench (yes, a bench) for my Pedi. There was no massage chair. FYI - the reason I like getting Pedi's is for the massage chair. That was disappointing. However, the technician did an excellent job! She really took her time and my feet felt brand new when she was done.I had to pick out a new color for my hands, because the color for my feet ran out. I thought was strange as well. Definitely the first time that ever happened before at nail salon. I picked out a new color and she began the Mani. However, another customer was getting a touch up on her no-chip Mani and needed to head out the door. My technician asked if it was ok to stop mine and help her. I felt rude saying no, so of course, I said sure. She was working on both of us at the same time. Again, very strange. I also noticed that the towel the technician was using is the exact towel I bought at Wal-Mart for my kitchen. Pretty low budget, but normally a very expensive place. The decor wasn't anything to speak of, and there was hip-hop music in the background. The other technicians were actually signing to it while working...again, strange.My technician did do an excellent job on my Mani. It's only the 2nd day, but it's holding up well.

My nails chip within a week and the last few times they've turned an icky blue under my pink nail polish.I've decided to give up on Sanctuary Nail Spa, but haven't given up on the no chip manicure. Most recently I tried another brand of no-chip at the East Bank Club spa. It's the same price as Sanctuary Nail Spa ($40 for a no-chip). It's been 2 weeks of no chips and they are still pale pink, which is what I was going for.

It offers the same selection of fresh produce, meat, deli, and bakery items. The emphasis is still on Michigan produce and other food items, including Zingerman's breads and pies, but they also have a See's Candies section (California!). If I had to make an analogy for non-Michigan natives, I'd say this store is the same category as Whole Foods (national), PCC (Washington), and Natural Pantry (Alaska).I come to Plum Market every week for their selection of Zingerman's breads and Boar's Head deli meats and cheeses. They often have samples of their newest items, and my most recent visit occurred during their Organic Harvest Festival. There were samples of \"smart chicken,\" chocolate-covered candied ginger, protein drink, watermelon-lime-mint juice from their juice bar, and of course, Zingerman's breads.The bread loaves are often on sale for half price, a rare sight and find in Ann Arbor. The staff are often hard to find in the produce section, but they are easier to find in the meat department, deli, bakery (very easy to find in the bakery), and skincare sections. My checkout experience is hit-or-miss, but I usually get asked if I found everything all right and wished a good day/great weekend. Like Whole Foods, there is a prepared foods and salad bar, and a coffee bar (but better, this is more like a coffee lab) using Intelligentsia coffee. There is also a juice bar, which is more like a juice splurge because the juices can run you upwards of ten dollars each. If you check-in on Yelp, you'll receive an offer for a dollar off your juice bar purchase. \u00a0 I encourage shoppers to sign up for Plum Rewards.

Overall, it isn't bad, a late night place to get drunkeER and find various types of mischief - if that's what you're in the market for. My last visit was really bad. I tried that new upstairs area after a black tie event. The bartender was the person who claimed to \"own\" that space. My guess is the owners give him a piece of the profits if he can bring people in, or maybe he was just full of sh**. For the most part, he was an OK guy, friendly and accommodating at first. As the night went on, the \"usual suspects\" (regulars, likely other bartenders and waitresses, hangers-on in for a free drink) started to show up and they were not too fond of the seemingly fancy-types in their cocktail dresses and tuxedos that were occupying their space. Sure, we were a little loaded, but that should have been par for the course for the Burton Place people.In short, the \"usual suspects\" mocked and made others feel uncomfortable while the bartender willingly allowed this behavior to take place, if not instigate it. The black-tie people were intoxicated, but the proper way to handle a situation (where you think one might be over-served and inappropriate) is to ask them to leave - not have your friends shout obscenities and shine a flash light on people - as the bartender did. It was a big fail on the part of the Burton Place staff and it embarrassed and enraged the black-tie people nearly causing an odd battle between the hangers-on people and the black-tie people (paying customers).My overall impression, the bartender gives away free drinks to his friends and those are the only people that frequent that top floor. This is bad business because these \"usual suspects\" go out of their way to make others feel unwelcome. It is that typical, 20-something year old, I'm a bartender and \"I hate the man,\" and this is MY place behavior. My advice to the bartender (if he's even still employed by the establishment) -- keep your obnoxious friends in check, you'll likely make more money and attract more paying customers and less hangers-on.

I love all the different taco joints in Chicago and to have this one on my doorstep would've been such a great regular option.I've now been to Buzz Bait a couple of times. Both times I left wishing I'd gone elsewhere. The first try was during their opening week - it was very busy and I was pleased to see them off to a good start! I ordered the tuna, the salmon and the battered cod tacos. The battered cod were ok but a little greasy. The tuna was tasteless and chewy, the salmon was far too sweet, almost sickly. I gave it a pass simply because it seems unfair to judge a place so soon after it opened. And this restaurant is the brainchild of Chicago (pizza) restaurant veteran Lou Malnati, so I was expecting better - possibly the culmination of Mr Malnati's decades of success, both front and back of house. Sadly the second time I visited Buzz Bait, several weeks later, it was even worse. The tacos hasn't improved (I couldn't even bring myself to finish them), and the service had taken a nose dive. We had to clean our own table, the staff behind the counter were rushing/panicking and for a fast-serve restaurant our order took over 15 minutes to come up. During that time we noticed that the layout of the small restaurant was making things worse. Customers didn't know where to stand, too much of the small restaurant is taken up by three large booths (usually only sitting a couple of slow eaters), leaving the other 15-20 customers to fight over a handful of bar stools.Sorry - but if I'm going to eat standing up in a taco joint, it had better be worth it.

Also, the bowl costs $11 and is probably half the size of a Chipotle burrito bowl. I was really disappointed that I couldn't substitute the rice in the fish bowl.

They treat the regulars - and each other - with a high degree of familiarity and friendliness, but for those who were only semi-regulars (like me), there's a decidedly cooler feel. There are often 2-3 of them on duty clustered behind the counter, smoking, chatting and laughing among themselves. I don't mean to over play this, and I never had a hint of an issue with any of them. But they could use some training I believe on making everyone feel welcome. The other gripe is that they shouldn't let people smoke cigarettes inside.

I would highly recommend the naan- it was fresh and toasty and delicious. You get four giant pieces. The goat was okay- there wasn't a whole lot of it, but I enjoyed dipping my naan in the sauce. The briyani was decent too. It tastes better when you mix in other sauces. You also get a small side salad. So you order your food, sit down, and they call you up to get your food when it is ready.

I always drive by & there is not a single parking spot outside on the street. All of those spots are always occupied by taxis. I even got an incredible recommendation from Dr. Nishan, a fellow Yelper, whose review about Tabaq is quite humorous. Nishan calls it his favorite and now I know why. \u00a0We were driving down the street when I saw a cab pulling out of a parking spot. We were hungry & decided today was the day we try Tabaq. We walked in & were greeted by the owner. He was so friendly and we loved talking to him. He went through all of the dishes and pointed out his favorites. We were so excited and couldn't decide. He even gave us a sample. After our sample we were sold & placed our order. We ordered a Haleem which is ground dal (lentil) with shredded beef. It came with a salad, fresh baked naan & a mint-cilantro sauce called raita. The haleem was so good and spicy. It was perfect food for a cold chilly day in Chicago. The spice warmed up every inch of my body. The dish would not win any awards for looks but it is a perfect 5 stars based on taste. If you don't believe me then go & check my photo but it's an ugly dish. Ha! I can hardly wait to come back & have this again. We read several reviews about the Chicken Biriyani being the best item on the menu. We couldn't deny all of those comments & we went for it. The plate was huge. It was stacked so high it almost touched the ceiling & I must admit it was everything everyone was is it would be. I would definitely order this item again on a return trip. It came with a side salad &!three chunks of chicken on the bone. I really had to work the chicken because it was not the user friendly chicken we all get at an American restaurant. This was meat chunks with tiny little bones everywhere. If you're looking for easy then this place is not for you. I love authentic and in my heart I feel like this place delivered. Our two dishes were a ton of food and we had a feast on our table. The owner came over to check on us & we were so excited about the food. He even brought over a ground chicken kabob patty with grilled onions & jalape\u00f1os. The patty was dry but full of fantastic flavors. It was the best chicken burger I've ever had. I'm so glad the owner brought this over because I was curious about how it tasted. It was a new way of serving chicken kabobs and much more easier to eat. \u00a0The owner even brought over Kheer which is a rice pudding with hints of cinnamon. He told us to eat it after we finished our food. It was really cute. He didn't want us to eat dessert before we cleaned our plates off. This was a perfect way to end our late lunch. It wasn't too sweet but had the right amount of flavor. We made our way back to the counter to pay for our meal. Yes they are very trusting here and you pay after you are done eating. All dishes are $8 except for the grilled fish which is $10. It makes it totally easy to order and pay.Of course we started talking to the owner and he talked about the special Halal meat. He also informed us that it was much more expensive the normal meat from Jewel. I knew most of this but it's great to hear a restaurant owner talk with pride about the quality of his food. He also told me to come back any time because he never closes. I wish I was still in my younger years because this place would be my new 3am burrito joint. It's funny how time changes and lifestyles change. The owner asked me to come back this Friday after 2pm because he is making chicken kabobs that will impress me. I told him I couldn't make this Friday but I would defiantly come back on an upcoming Friday. I just thought he was such a nice person and is everything you want in a restaurant owner. His friendliness & kindness towards us makes us want to come back again & again. If you do decide to come here then don't be afraid. There is a good chance you will be the only person here who doesn't drive for a living. Not once will you feel out of place. Eating here reminds me of my culinary adventures around the world but I'm in my own backyard of Chicago. This is why I love this city. You can drive from neighborhood to neighborhood to get the most authentic traditional food ever. This makes Chicago a culinary treat for me.We also met a doctor who comes in here every day for a green tea chai with milk. He recommended we get one, while we were talking to the owner. Next thing we knew the owner had poured two for us to take. This place rocks. I had never had this drink but it was unique and good. Honestly this place is the best.

I always drive by & there is not a single parking spot outside on the street. All of those spots are always occupied by taxis. I even got an incredible recommendation from Dr. Nishan, a fellow Yelper, whose review about Tabaq is quite humorous. Nishan calls it his favorite and now I know why. \u00a0We were driving down the street when I saw a cab pulling out of a parking spot. We were hungry & decided today was the day we try Tabaq. We walked in & were greeted by the owner. He was so friendly and we loved talking to him. He went through all of the dishes and pointed out his favorites. We were so excited and couldn't decide. He even gave us a sample. After our sample we were sold & placed our order. We ordered a Haleem which is ground dal (lentil) with shredded beef. It came with a salad, fresh baked naan & a mint-cilantro sauce called raita. The haleem was so good and spicy. It was perfect food for a cold chilly day in Chicago. The spice warmed up every inch of my body. The dish would not win any awards for looks but it is a perfect 5 stars based on taste. If you don't believe me then go & check my photo but it's an ugly dish. Ha! I can hardly wait to come back & have this again. We read several reviews about the Chicken Biriyani being the best item on the menu. We couldn't deny all of those comments & we went for it. The plate was huge. It was stacked so high it almost touched the ceiling & I must admit it was everything everyone was is it would be. I would definitely order this item again on a return trip. It came with a side salad &!three chunks of chicken on the bone. I really had to work the chicken because it was not the user friendly chicken we all get at an American restaurant. This was meat chunks with tiny little bones everywhere. If you're looking for easy then this place is not for you. I love authentic and in my heart I feel like this place delivered. Our two dishes were a ton of food and we had a feast on our table. The owner came over to check on us & we were so excited about the food. He even brought over a ground chicken kabob patty with grilled onions & jalape\u00f1os. The patty was dry but full of fantastic flavors. It was the best chicken burger I've ever had. I'm so glad the owner brought this over because I was curious about how it tasted. It was a new way of serving chicken kabobs and much more easier to eat. \u00a0The owner even brought over Kheer which is a rice pudding with hints of cinnamon. He told us to eat it after we finished our food. It was really cute. He didn't want us to eat dessert before we cleaned our plates off. This was a perfect way to end our late lunch. It wasn't too sweet but had the right amount of flavor. We made our way back to the counter to pay for our meal. Yes they are very trusting here and you pay after you are done eating. All dishes are $8 except for the grilled fish which is $10. It makes it totally easy to order and pay.Of course we started talking to the owner and he talked about the special Halal meat. He also informed us that it was much more expensive the normal meat from Jewel. I knew most of this but it's great to hear a restaurant owner talk with pride about the quality of his food. He also told me to come back any time because he never closes. I wish I was still in my younger years because this place would be my new 3am burrito joint. It's funny how time changes and lifestyles change. The owner asked me to come back this Friday after 2pm because he is making chicken kabobs that will impress me. I told him I couldn't make this Friday but I would defiantly come back on an upcoming Friday. I just thought he was such a nice person and is everything you want in a restaurant owner. His friendliness & kindness towards us makes us want to come back again & again. If you do decide to come here then don't be afraid. There is a good chance you will be the only person here who doesn't drive for a living. Not once will you feel out of place. Eating here reminds me of my culinary adventures around the world but I'm in my own backyard of Chicago. This is why I love this city. You can drive from neighborhood to neighborhood to get the most authentic traditional food ever. This makes Chicago a culinary treat for me.We also met a doctor who comes in here every day for a green tea chai with milk. He recommended we get one, while we were talking to the owner. Next thing we knew the owner had poured two for us to take. This place rocks. I had never had this drink but it was unique and good. Honestly this place is the best.

But we made it!Initial thought upon entering: Awesome vibe, unique vintage decor, and real candles that were lit with real fire! I loved it! And the photos following you up the staircase to the lounge were right up my alley.Play-by-play: Once we were seated, we had to wait quite some time for our waitress to notice we were even there. Granted it was a busy night and we were in a corner, but I was still a little surprised that it took 15 minutes to be noticed. Finally! She does! First, we order our drinks. An Old Fashioned for me and a PBR for the boyfriend. This took about another 10-15 minutes to receive. They weren't the craziest of drink orders so once again, we were surprised at the wait. Now by no means do we want to be rushed through our date, but it would be nice to have our drinks early so we can peruse the menu whilst sipping. Then we ordered our food which consisted of a Chicken Caesar Salad and Scallops. And yet another long wait for a surprisingly light meal. Last, but not least, we order the cheesecake for dessert. AND OH MY GOSH, it was amazing! This was, by far, the highlight of the meal for the both of us. It was surprisingly big and only $7 so that was a nice.Final synopsis: Even though our waitress was very, very nice, she could have been a little more attentive. The table next to us told us that they had been having the same issue with waiting a long time for drinks and food so we weren't alone in our feelings.

He left again.He came back about 5 min later. Still ignored us. We then asked him if we could just sit where we were already sitting up front, and he said no. Then left again.He came back a few minutes later, and we asked again about getting seated seeing as the place was half empty and we were afraid if he left again, we wouldn't see him for a while. He rudely said he'd seat us in a few minutes, did not apologize, and rudely said they were understaffed, and walked away again.Despite being super excited to try that omelet, he was so rude and it was so annoying to be standing around for no reason, so we left.Having working in hospitality myself, if he was truly understaffed, that is unfortunate, but there are much better ways to handle the situation. His tone and attitude were so unnecessary, and did not make us feel welcome in the least bit.

When I read about this place opening not too far from where I live, I was really glad to say the least, especially with taro.The space is pretty nice, clean, and open. I think it could use a few more tables, but not much. Another good and smart touch is that they have board games there which is great along with a few communal tables so you can easily play the games.This seems like a great place you'd come to work kind of quietly or just play your friends at some board/card game.The girl working today, who I have a feeling is one of the owners, was really nice, helpful, and cool. Easy to talk to and really had some great suggestions. I started out with the Taro milk tea (w/boba). I'm used to seeing it purple and in this case it wasn't. It quickly became apparent to me that they actually use real taro to make this as I sipped up little bits of it - a lot of other places use powder mix so I appreciate them actually making it the right way. The boba were also really good - not too hard but not too soft. High quality.After that I had a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato which was pretty good. The tomato on it was roma tomatoes and on the outside was melted cheese (tasted like Asiago). Nice touch - not your typical grilled cheese but good. After that, I ordered some more. Some Jasmine milk tea with lychee, a lemon ricotta cookie, and banana bundt cake. All were really good and I ended up liking the Jasmine milk tea more than the Taro. The girl suggested the lychee in it which was an expert recommendation. The lemon ricotta cookie was really good too. Kind of sweet, but really lemony. The banana bundt cake was pretty damn good too.I'll definitely be back and this place is good. I really appreciate how they use fresh ingredients instead of powder mixes for their milk tea. I'm hoping they're in business for a long time. There's no shortage of pedestrian traffic near there. People just need to come in. Some people may be apprehensive since they don't know what bubble/milk tea is. They should give out some samples for free on the sidewalk to get people more interested and informed.

Since I was in town for a few days, I had to try Chicago milk tea and this was one of the highest rated tea places around the hotel that I was staying at. Cassava Cafe is definitely a cute cafe with such beautiful wall decors. It's a very clean and nice place. It's a great place for a group of friends to hang out thanks to all the cards, puzzle and board games that they have there. They even have a Foosball table, which is pretty awesome in my opinion.The only girl working there that night was really friendly and sweet.Anyways, they serve, food, tea and dessert here, but I only got to try the tea. It's pretty cool that they use completely fresh ingredients to make their drinks. Like usually in milk tea, most places would normally use powder or syrup, but this place actually uses real fruits. For example, in a strawberry milk tea, they normally use strawberry powder or syrup, but Cassava Cafe actually uses fresh strawberries to make their drinks. I wonder if that's good, but I actually ordered the Jasmine Milk Tea instead since the worker said that it was their best drink and it was also the most popular drink. Unfortunately, I did not like it. It tasted way to plain and just didn't taste like jasmine milk tea. I also tried the Taro drink as well. I definitely tasted the fresh Taro in that drink. And the real flavor for Taro isn't really that good...Even though it is definitely better to use real and fresh ingredients, Taro has a really strong flavor to it. Like when tea places uses Taro powder, it takes away a lot of the actual flavor and leaves a sweet taste to it. I only know a few places that use real taro to make it and this place tastes similar to the other places as well... So it's definitely a good drink for real Taro lovers, and I guess I am not a real Taro lover. Overall, I didn't like the tea I got. The Jasmine Tea was just too plain and didn't taste like Jasmine. The Taro drink is okay. But overall, I think I would only come back to try their food and dessert. I've been to too many tea places and I know what I like. Jasmine milk tea is the easiest milk tea to make and hard to mess up on.

It quickly became apparent to me that they actually use real taro to make this as I sipped up little bits of it - a lot of other places use powder mix so I appreciate them actually making it the right way. The boba were also really good - not too hard but not too soft. High quality.After that I had a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato which was pretty good. The tomato on it was roma tomatoes and on the outside was melted cheese (tasted like Asiago). Nice touch - not your typical grilled cheese but good. After that, I ordered some more. Some Jasmine milk tea with lychee, a lemon ricotta cookie, and banana bundt cake. All were really good and I ended up liking the Jasmine milk tea more than the Taro. The girl suggested the lychee in it which was an expert recommendation. The lemon ricotta cookie was really good too. Kind of sweet, but really lemony. The banana bundt cake was pretty damn good too.I'll definitely be back and this place is good. I really appreciate how they use fresh ingredients instead of powder mixes for their milk tea. I'm hoping they're in business for a long time. There's no shortage of pedestrian traffic near there. People just need to come in. Some people may be apprehensive since they don't know what bubble/milk tea is. They should give out some samples for free on the sidewalk to get people more interested and informed.

The order was quite big and I thought I had ordered a bit too much for myself to finish. Nope.The Sesame Chicken, as another reviewer has noted, was flavorless. I have never dipped chicken in so much sauce for it to taste like nothing. Not salty, not saucy, nothing. I don't even know what I was eating. I guess it may have been healthier because it certainly tasted like nothing. The dish it came in was large, but 30% of it was broccoli and a weird vegetable that I didn't quite like. I actually don't even know what it was.The Pork Lo Mein was, well, not really a lo mein. The noodles used was a vermicelli sized curly noodle, which you know if you eat Chinese food as much as I do, is often used for chow mein. Maybe they ran out or maybe Chicago uses these for lo mein, but it was not what I was expecting. Very little flavor, and way too many odd vegetables for me to enjoy.I'm glad I ordered the above two orders, however, because the free beef fried rice that came with the +$20 order was quite good. Other reviewers have said they didn't like the beef that was in the rice, which I definitely agree with, but you can't really have pieces of filet mignon in fried rice, and after the first two dishes, I was relieved to find something rather edible. The order also came with a side of white rice, which was, to my surprise, bad. How do you mess up white rice?

The items I have had and enjoyed were: Turkey Bolognese, Chicken and Butternut Squash, Snap Caesar Salad with Chicken, and Banana Nut Pancakes which were great! Snap Kitchen has a meal program were customers commit to daily healthy eating program for as little as 3 days, or 21 days.

The other element that Snap Kitchen has going for them is their staff, they are extremely outgoing individuals.

The wall of food was divided by size and color coded: snacks and meals of various portions.I paid with my credit card at the register and signed up for their rewards program. Next, we got spoons and napkins from a station that also housed condiments and microwaves and then we sat down at the front window.All of our food was scrumptious! The Curried Chicken Salad was our favorite. It had the savory and sweet mix that is customary in curry and the chicken was cut up extra small.We were surprised that we liked the Chia & Date Pudding as much as we did. It had delicious flavor and a lumpy, slimy texture.The Devily Eggs were made with a hummus middle instead of the typical yellow/mayo stuff. It was a good change that I understood and accepted.Lastly, the Snap War Bar was good. It smelled kind of like carrot cake or banana bread. The texture was a lot like a soft, dense bread. It had all of these healthy ingredients in it.We were a little disappointed that there wasn't tap water available (only bottled for sale) and that they don't recycle.

I was impressed with a brand called Electra and their model called the Verse Equipe, that was even on sale too. I then telephoned the shop and spoke with a very knowledgeable gentleman named David who was most helpful. He even did something that most salespeople neglect to do, he asked for the sale by saying \"Could I build one for you?\". I replied yes, but I had two conditions, I wanted to pay cash (around the holidays, I really don't make purchases by credit card, it's too easy to go overboard), and I wouldn't be able to pick it up until the following weekend. \u00a0David said that wouldn't be a problem and he had the bicycle built for me. **There should be at least some type of warning attached to their website, because it is very addictive! I went back to the site and found several accessories that I wanted added to the bike. I phoned the shop and this time I spoke with Tim who answered all my questions and made sure the accessories were added to my bike and it would be ready for pickup. With such excellent attention to customer satisfaction, I even signed up for their newsletter on their website. It was a pleasant surprise when they sent me a Christmas present, a $10.00 gift certificate! I was even more pleasantly surprised by Yelp with an offer of $50.00 for $25.00, and an additional $10.00 off with $25.00 in accessories as a checkin offer! \u00a0Today I picked the bike up and they were just as incredible in person as they were on the telephone. I even found a couple more toys too add to the bike. Bill added the new toys to the bike, spent more time going of the features and accessories than the Mercedes dealer did when I got my new car. \u00a0Mercedes didn't even come close to the free services Village includes with your new bike purchase. He didn't even grumble when a noticed a scratch of the front fender that was swapped out very quickly. Heck, he even helped me load it into my car. I'm going to stop now, not only because I could go on much longer singing their praises; but I just got the bike home and I'm dying to take it for a ride! If you need a new bicycle, don't be put off by Village perhaps not being your local bike shop (it was over a 40 mile trek for me); it's worth it to find an honest and helpful shop that isn't going to \"take you for a ride\".

Past experience has shown me that despite him being a lifelong suburbanite who makes rare trips to the city, his recommendations for stuff in Chicago have always been spot-on.I went on a very busy summer Saturday and explained to these guys that I hadn't been on a bike in 25 years and needed one to 1) run quick errands that wouldn't require me to drive or use CTA, and 2) lose about 800 pounds that I desperately need to shed. Never once was I pressured into anything that was terribly costly, and these guys made sure that before I made a final selection that the bike and the frame were appropriate for my height. (Wait...actually, I take back the thing about being pressured...I was almost not allowed to think of leaving unless I bought a helmet! Which was okay because I was planning to do that anyway.)They set me up with a nice Trek Shift 2, which I took home and named Syd. So far the rides have been pretty darn nice, weather permitting. (You know how hard it is for a fat guy to pedal against huge gusts of wind?)A few things worth mentioning that I like about Village Cycle Center:- Huge selection -- not just for bikes but accessories as well.- Free compressed air outside in case you need to inflate your tires. I know that some other stores do that as well, but that's still a nice touch.- Unlike with, say, Johnny Sprockets (another store that I have had great experiences with), you don't have to try to balance a door and your bike when entering -- the entrance is wide open, you just walk the bike right in, no hassling with the door trying to close on you.- Free checkup after 30 hours/30 rides. Again, I know some places offer this, but it's still nice to know I can get that done. Just two days ago from this writing I had my service taken care of, and there was a noticeable positive difference on the ride home.- Prices are reasonable, and they seemingly always have some kind of a sale going on.If you were to ask me what I DON'T like about Village Cycle Center, hmmm....I'd have to say....1) They don't stock \"Bort\" license plates.2) And this is NOT their fault, but...if you have to have any service done that requires a wait, you'll find that the neighborhood is...pretty useless unless you're hungry, thirsty, or a woman looking for kitschy crap. (If you're a MAN looking for kitschy crap, sorry; it's for women only in this neighborhood; you're better off in Andersonville, which does have very good kitschy crap for both men and women.)

While not all of the farmers are organic (which is kind of a joke of a label thanks to the FDA), the majority practice sustainable farming. That means they actually care about the land they use, as well as the animals they raise. If that matters to you, too, then you should really come to this market. Yes, it can get crowded, but honestly, it's not unmanageable. It's not like you're walking into a Wal-Mart on Black Friday, and it beats the heck out of Whole Foods or any other generic grocery store, which is likely to be even more packed on a Saturday.Big-ups to some of my favorite farms here: Meadow Haven Farm, Heartland Meats, Hawk's Hill Ranch, Ellis Farms, Green Acres Farms, Genesis Growers, River Valley Ranch, and Nordic Creamery.

It's incredibly rare that you can feel someone's love of their craft through their hands, but that's the kind of magic I felt when I was under her care. She took the time to assess my skin problems (overall dryness and congestion on my nose) and was very thorough answering all my questions. Sometimes you may not feel comfortable asking questions when someone uses terms like dermis and dermaplaning, but she explained everything in laymen's terms, without making me feel uncomfortable or uneducated.Then she went to work. I believe I got a lactic peel + facial. It was hard to concentrate I was so relaxed. I'm sure there were cleansers, exfoliates, chemical peels, salicylic acid on the nose, virtually painless extractions, and moisturizers but I won't pretend to know what they were. My favorite part was the massage on my scalp and temples. Also, to note, when I was finished and dared to take a gander in the mirror, I didn't even recognize my skin.

A couple of times I almost had to hang up because I felt my verbal cues were being ignored. So she seems to take a great interest in customized treatment, but when I made my second appointment, I said, \"I'd like exactly the treatment you did last time - it was perfect!\" Her response: \"Well, I have a lot of clients so you'll have to tell me what you got.\" Gee, I don't know - I showed up, she took a look at my skin, and then went through about 7 - 8 steps. I don't know what the name was and the treatments are NOT listed on her site.- On my second visit, I was about 15 minutes early. While the salon clients were offered hot tea, I was brushed over since I was an Amy client. Amy popped out and sort of scolded me for being early - it was so awkward I could only assume she was joking, but then when she was 25 mins late (making that 40 mins of waiting for me), there was no apology. Then, during the facials, I just got wierded out. There was a funny energy coming from her that did not allow me to relax. I knew she would do a great job, but I just wanted it to be over with and get out - both times. My skin did not feel pampered, per se - she is all results, and the results are good. The woman is a perfectionist when it comes to the complexion. She's also efficient once she starts on you.So if you have no intuition and are easygoing about customer service, you might end up loving your facial, but to me, a sense of welcome and a sense of peace in such a place is important. I prefer a place, like Elina Organics with Nadia, where I get perfect, glowing skin and a sense of tranquility - an escape from stress.One more tip - there is no transparency into the pricing since treatments are not listed online, which made me a bit uneasy.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 3, 24]}, "14": {"description": "I am convinced that Amy is the saint of skin.

I stumbled into the AT&T store, at my wit's end and ready to just buy a Blackberry.

The space is replete with Middle Eastern culture. When you walk in you hear beautiful, regional music, you see gorgeous fabric murals and rugs along the walls along with other tiny art pieces. \u00a0The staff is friendly, inviting and welcoming. \u00a0I knew I was in the right place for a late lunch. \u00a0This is most definitely a \"mom and pop\" type place, and highly authentic. \u00a0The staff makes you feel so welcome and does not rush you out of the place. \u00a0It is as if they want you there, enjoying the food, relaxing and soaking in the atmosphere. This is the real deal... And I speak from a certain point/place of knowledge ;)We ordered the Combo Platter to start while we made several other choices. This lavish platter comes with Falafel (my absolute favorite), Baba-ghanoush, Hummus, Tabbouleh, a delicious salad and of course--pita bread for dipping into all those wonderful spreads. \u00a0We also had the Chicken Kebob--yep, you guessed it--to die for! \u00a0Nick got the Stuffed Grape Leaves and we made him share. \u00a0Lauren ordered the Kefka Kebob and that was a super display of the right way to serve lamb. \u00a0I went ahead and grabbed a(nother) Falafel wrapped in pita as well; because the falafel on the platter was so amazing I had to have more. \u00a0I seriously forgot I was in Chicago for a moment and had returned to the Old City for real... That is really saying something.

In a word: average. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back given the other choices on Wells, but I wouldn't go out of my way to advise against it. As others have said, the space is nice. The setup reminds me of Stout, only bigger and definitely cleaner. You won't feel crowded. The menu is large. There are at least six items in every category, including starters, mains, sandwiches, and sides. There are also about ten items dedicated to brunch, which is served until 3pm. Everything on the menu is heavy. I was hungry but knew I would feel overly full if I ate an entire portion of anything. My girlfriend and I ordered a side of chicken wings and a side of French fries. Each item came with a mayonnaise-based sauce (see: heavy). The wings were good and the portion is generous (eight I believe). The fries were just fries. That being said, it's a bar. I wasn't expecting many light or healthy options on the menu. A few additions on the non-gut-busting side would be nice though. I didn't have any cocktails, just a bloody mary. It's worth noting they use beef consume in it, which I think is an odd choice. I wasn't a fan. Our server was very nice. She was attentive until the end of our visit when the bar seemed to get more crowded, then she was MIA for quite awhile, to the point that we decided to close our tab and go down the street to Pour House instead of stay for another beer. To her credit, it was obvious she was sat too many tables too quickly and in the weeds; she wasn't ignoring us on purpose. What really turned me off was that the manager that afternoon walked by our table serveral times and never asked if we needed anything or took any (of the many) plates off our (small) table. Instead, he stopped to talk to a table of - what appeared to be - his friends for five minutes or so. I appreciate a manager who will roll up his sleeves and help his staff.

Just how good this food is.. Let metell you.. every single entr\u00e9e I have brought home has been phenominal..And..this is all pre-portioned quality food, if you're thinking it's anythinglike Lean Cuisine or a Weight Watchers frozen meal you would be mistaken.Because this is all top of the line stuff!For the Record.. prices do vary depending on the portion size youare getting.. the recommended size for women is small and that's whatI have been getting and it's just perfect..But.. the difference here is that this is a lifestyle change and instead ofblowing money at McDonalds you could be getting healthier options here.And.. once again.. everything has tasted great!So..

I am vegan, and this never seems to be a problem when eating at restaurants in Chicago, a city that is normally relatively vegan friendly.

All he had to say (in a very rude manner) was, \"what's vegan?\" Now, I understand that vegans do not make up a very large percentage of the population, but there are quite a few of us in Chicago and I would expect someone who works in the food business to at least be aware of the meaning of the word vegan. After patiently explaining to the waiter that I do not consume any animal products, he said (while wearing a very puzzled expression) \"Well uh...We have fruit.\" Going into any restaurant that isn't typically meant for vegans, I don't expect a menu as abundant as the non-vegans around me get to choose from. I do, however, expect at least one or two options more impressive than just fruit and/or vegetables. I don't think people realize how easy it is to whip up a batch of vegan pancakes, or throw together some oatmeal with soy milk and a handful of raisins and nuts!! I ended up ordering the fruit, which turned out to be an okay array of fruit, albeit pretty overpriced considering it was just that: fruit. The waiter also brought me a side of cottage cheese and a slice of date nut bread, neither of which I could eat. The cottage cheese for obvious reasons, and the bread I found out was made using eggs. My friends ordered pancakes, which they said were okay, although while eating we were disturbed by an argument that was taking place at the table next to us between the customers and their waitress. We also had to ask several times for water refills because apparently our waiter was too busy to notice our glasses were empty on several occasions.

Regardless of the time, we finally got a good server- Omar was nice, polite, soft spoken, and attentive. There was one server whom we noticed on the floor who was not only rude to her current tables (whom we were sitting right next to) by mumbling comments and rolling her eyes when was asked for things by her tables (ex: they asked for a togo bag several times and from or server as well... When she finally came over with the bag she proceeded to yell across the floor \"yah I know I know I had to go get it okay!?\" To her table and other employees whom were reminding her. When her table waved her over she was half way across the room and said \"what?\" It took her about a min to actually walk up to her table to see what they needed... RUDE)! If we would have had her as a server we would have left. All that being said it was a bit over priced for the service provided... The food I received was cold upon arrival and was subpar at best.

First up, their 18-year aged balsamic- very good, but not great. I prefer the consistency to be more on the heavy side, theirs is a bit light, nonetheless I bought a bottle anyway. I sampled some of the flavored vinegars and found the acidity too high for my liking, but the strawberry balsamic was divine! I took a bottle of that as well!

After re-evaluating my experience at Sara Jane, I still have the following things to say. We went to this store for a private shopping event that my friend bid on at a charity event. The owner made several rude comments about how no one was shopping, how no one bought anything, and the females present at the party can confirm these statements were made (since the owner questioned the validity of these statements in my original post). Several of the girls bought things, including 2 scarves, a sweater, 2 shirts, and a tank (which we all have receipts for in case the owner wants to question the validity of that as well). It is my opinion that the the store owner was rude, and acted annoyed that we were in there and not every individual spent money on her clothes. It came to a point that we all grabbed our stuff and walked out because it was so uncomfortable being in there. I think this woman needs to re-evaluate how she treats her customers, and also how she handles criticism. Yelp is a site that can be utilized for good experiences and bad, and I had a bad one. I'd like to conclude this by stating I am writing about my honest and unfortunate experience with this boutique and this overly aggressive and extremely unprofessional woman who owns it.

I've visited twice and have been laden with outfits to try and cajoled, which is exactly my shopping style. The folks working there seem to be casual and fun.If there's something I dislike about shopping (in general) it's going through racks. Sara Jane has walls lined with racks (in case that IS your style). I am extremely appreciative that the employees at Sara Jane coddle me and put me into a fitting room and hand me outfits so that I can curtail the racks.Speaking of the fitting rooms, they are curtained off from the rest of the store. The curtains are hard to close and there is a gap along the mirrored wall where you can see clearly into the neighboring fitting room.The clothes are pretty unique. It's nice to know that you won't see any other person wearing the same thing as you when you purchased it from Sara Jane. It's easy to tell that the person (or people) who do the merchandising at Sara Jane has a distinctive style. There are funky patterns, colors, and flowy/stretchy fabrics. I noticed a few items with leather-like accents during my last visit. There are large pieces of jewelry such as bangles, cuffs, and bold necklaces and a few daintier accessories.Although I'm not \u00a0au courant, I have a vague sense of what works on me. I am short, slender, and have an athletic build. I have nothing to camouflage with pleats and drapery. I need structured clothing to help create curves where there are none. That said, I need to be careful about fitted clothing that is aimed to showcase a tiny waist or length (both of which I don't have). Most of the clothing at Sara Jane is probably intended for women with curves.The first time I went to Sara Jane I tried several pieces and came away empty handed. The next time I tried on at least eight outfits and came away with a dress, two pairs of earrings, and a bandeau (a one-size-fits-all strapless bra) for $150.

And it was a rough day at work for both of us.I stopped at four other restaurants to try to get some dinner that Monday and all of them were closed. I stumbled upon this place because a) it was open, and b) it was close to home.We got two different burgers and fries: the Mexican Burger and the Old Town Saloon Burger; the sweet potato fries and the parmesan garlic waffle fries.The prices and creativity of the burgers were great. The major disappointment was in the imbalance of quality to shoddy ingredients. Unfortunately for Old Town Burger Saloon, they picked the meat to skimp on at a time when we've been honing our taste for high quality ground beef. There were pieces of hard gristle in the burgers that were so large that we picked them out of our mouths. They also got low quality bacon that was thin and under-cooked. The other ingredients were spot on delicious.Another disappointment (and this could be because I did take-out) was that the buns and fries were soggy. The bottom bun of the burger was wet (and not with hamburger juices). The fries weren't at all crispy. I have created better fries from a frozen bag and my own oils and seasonings at home.Service was okay. They took my order, helped to validate my decisions, and told me an accurate ETA. Besides that, they didn't have much interaction with me. That's okay and I'm not holding it against them.I can't convince M to give them another shot and I don't want to! We've decided that if we have another bad work day on a Monday that we will just make our own burgers at home. Sure, our burgers won't have cool toppings on them but they will have better quality meat and we won't have to pick pieces of it out of our mouths.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 8, 14]}, "22": {"description": "Like everyone else, we came here with a groupon.

I called on Monday, September 3, 2012 to make sure it was still redeemable. I was told yes, by a female employee, but only for carry-out, not for delivery. I placed the order on Wednesday, September 5, 2012 online, and in the comments section I put \"I have a Restaurant.com certificate\", figuring if there was a problem, someone would contact me PRIOR to driving to the location to pick up my order. I get to the location, talk to the employee, (who also later said he was the manager on duty), and he tells me the total. I present my Restaurant.com certificate and he tells me he doesn't know what to do, so he'll talk to the manager. He comes back after a few minutes and tells me that the company, Sarpino's, no longer uses Restaurant.com certificates- sorry. He said he spoke to his general manager, Alex, and he was told that they ended their contract with them over a year ago and it would not be accepted. So, I assumed maybe there was some miscommunication, and I asked to speak to the general manager myself. I was told he wasn't there. So I asked to talk to a regular manager, and that's when the young gentleman I had be talking to said he was the manager and offered to call Alex so I could speak to him. The conversation with Alex, via cell phone, was long and drawn out. I had to ask him more than once to stop talking over me so I had a chance to rebuttal the negative accusations he was making about me, the paying customer. He told me that they would not accept the Restaurant.com certificate and when I started to ask questions as to why, he was very rude and unprofessional. I should have counted how many times the words MONEY and BUISNESS came out of his mouth. That is all he was concerned with. He did not utter the word CUSTOMER or HAPPY once. Alex: We do not have an account with them for over a year ma'am, they notified all the customers and told them they had 2 months to use them, we did that as a CURTEOSY for youMe: No one notified me?Alex: That's Restauarnt.com's fault. You need to call them. They need to give you the money back. I can't lose money for my businessMe: I understand you don't have an account with them anymore, meaning you don't sell them, but I bought this 2 years ago, and it clearly states at the bottom there is no expiration dateAlex: We don't have an account ma'am. It is no good. You need to call them. You're not a regular customer obviously if you've had it for 2 years. You haven't spent $25 in 2 years.Me: I've never ordered from Sarpino's before. I was waiting for the right time and thought tonight would be perfect. Alex: \u00a0You bought it because it was a good deal, right? Our business lost a lot of money from these certificates so we cancelled our account.Me: No, I bought it because I have heard good things about your pizza and wanted to try it. The certificate never expires.Alex: I can print anything, I can print 30, 40 certificates onlineMe: So, are you saying I'm a fraud? That this isn't a real certificate?Alex: Well, how do I know?Me: There's a validation number to call?Alex: Did you call it?Me: No, I don't work hereAlex: What do you want me to do? I cannot use it. \u00a0I'll give you $15 off.Me: Well, I had to spend $35 to use it, so $15 off is still more money than I was planning to spendAlex: How much were you planning to spend?Me: $10.Alex: NO NO NO. I'd be losing money. $15 offMe: Well sir, you're about to lose a customer. The food has already been made; you're going to lose money either way. This entire experience, from ordering to pick up, to talking on the phone and going round and round with someone only concerned about his money, not the customer, took up over an hour of my time. Needless to say, I left. I was done listening to this guy waste my time, (and I was starving), and had to think of another source for dinner. Once I cooled off, ate, and started to relax, I called Restaurant.com to find out what exactly was the case. I talked to Melanie, who was a very sweet and very kind. I told her what had happen. She looked up my account, saw the unused certificate, and looked up Sarpino's account to see the status of it: ACTIVE. Yes, Sarpino's: your account is still active. So, Alex- you lied to me. Not only was my time wasted, but I was lied to by the general manager. Restauart.com has sent a notification to the relations department and hopefully something will be done so another innocent customer will not be treated this way.

Well not this time! it hardly took less than 1 minute to remove 8 nails. Bottom line: they use very cheap and inefficient glue (which probably justifies their lower prices) and your gel nails will NOT last as long as they should.

I file, shape, trim, buff my nails/cuticles/skin enough that any nail tech working on me just has to maintain and do a good paint job. At Elite this past week, they couldn't even do that. A friend and I went after work on a Wed, with only a handful of other customers in the salon. We asked the [super awkward] front desk girl for the mani-pedi special and she said the regular option ($28) wasn't available but we could do the spa ($32). No explanation. We said OK (glad we got the spa in the end, only redeeming thing from the whole ordeal were the massage chairs. No cooling gel was used, so not sure what else the \"spa\" included that day). \u00a0After a few seconds of soaking, my girl started on my toes, and within 5-6 min she had taken off the previous polish, \"filed\" my feet and nails, and \"trimmed\" my cuticles. Once I got home, however, I saw she didn't really do anything. The few bits that needed fixing weren't touched, and my nails were different lengths. I got a 1 min leg massage that was OK, and she painted in a surprising few minutes. When she grabbed my stuff I was shocked it was already time to get up. My friend's tech also rushed through the process and sadly didn't even give her a leg/foot massage (in an attempt to stay on par with my speedy tech??). We both sat dazed at our mani stations when I realized I hadn't picked out a finger color yet. I asked the girl (who was suddenly another person-- my initial tech had disappeared) if I could pick my color and she said \"I'll get it, I know what you want\" ??? NO, no you don't. I hobbled over to the wall after her and I said I wanted a very natural light blush/beige color. She grabbed 3 very white looking bottles and sat down. So i followed her, stupidly, and let her do a color that she said I wanted. I was all caught up in their mad rush. I file my fingernails regularly, but she said \"oh you have beautiful nails\" and barely touched them with the file at all. Yes, they were already shaped, but it would have been nice to file them down a bit so they wouldn't be ungodly long in a week. Her cuticle trimming was nonexistent and she quickly painted. Within 10 minutes my manicure was over. I waited another 5 min for my friend to finish, we sprayed the quick dry spray and jetted out of there. We both lamented the fingernail job-- the paint covered many of my still-there cuticles, ensuring it would soon start peeling off at the edges-- but my friends was the worst. Her poor hands had needed some work, and they got none. Her previous red polish was still under her nails so it looked like her fingernails were bloody. Hangnails and cuticles were hanging on jaggedly around nearly every nail. Her pale pink polish was put on unevenly so it looked liney. What a crazy bad job from a professional! As expected, the paint around my cuticles started peeling the next day. By Fri (2 days) it was wearing off the tips of my nails. I don't do hard labor, and I hadn't even been doing the dishes. I really wanted it to last until Sunday for a party. But by Sat I HAD to take it off (and trim my own cuticles), it looked so horrid.

It speaks volumes that I'm writing a one star review. It's not my style.As every girl's night out begins, we ordered a round of drinks. I went up to get a drink for my friend and myself, and I ordered the same no frills drink, a rum-soda-water. I saw the bartender pour dark rum into the drink, which I have a particular aversion to. Without a word (understandable, it's a loud bar), he put them in front of me and went back to serve others. Since it was so crowded, I got the other bartender's attention and told him I wanted clear, not dark, and he insisted the drink was brown because it was reflecting the brass of the bar. I quickly assured him that I saw bartender 1 pour dark rum, and that the watered-down-coke-looking drink wasn't due to the color of the bar (I'll give him props for creativity). He said he couldn't do anything, because he didn't pour it. Fine.I got ahold of bartender 1, and told him the scenario. He said that I should have specified. I apologized, and told him that the first time (and everywhere else I had ordered that drink in my life), clear rum was used. I felt bad for being a princess and was about to leave, but just thought I might as well ask if he could remake it. He looked at me and walked away. Being an optimist, I assumed he was walking away to enthusiastically re-make my drinks (Clearly, wasn't following my sage advice about expectations = reality, oops).Ten minutes went by. I'm pretty sure my other girlfriends thought that I had been swallowed whole by the jungle that is the bar and was never returning. I hopped off the barstool, drink-less, and looked at my other best friend to leave. She assured me that I should get what I want, and called the bartender over to ask him he would remake our drinks. He once again stated that I should have specified (okay, dad), and I started repeating my apology and rationalization. Halfway through, he grabs the drinks he originally poured from in front of me, rashly chucks them in the garbage, pours new drinks, and shoves them in my face without a straw or anything, glares at me, and moves away. I was shocked. If i wanted to be treated poorly at a bar, I would have invited my high school frenemies to join my GNO.Needless to say, I didn't drink my drink and went home. I was so upset in how I had been treated over a simple request. I never raised my voice or was argumentative. It's really unfortunate that one encounter has tainted my whole review of the bar, but it was so upsetting.

It looked so clean and well decorated. \u00a0There was a restaurant inside as well, but that was not why we came. \u00a0With ample room between tables and large walkways in a dimly lit large space, OTPH was really awesome.There was also a fabulous cocktail selection, but OTPH is better known for the beer. \u00a0The Pour House offers almost 100 beers on tap, which can be time consuming as one decides what to order. \u00a0None to worry, the bartender was so patient with us. \u00a0He had amazing suggestions, samples and tons of knowledge. It was about $7-8 for a beer, which seemed fine for Nick, and I stuck with my usual martini--dirty ;) There was also a wide selection of food to choose from, and if we had not already pigged out before we came I most definitely would have indulged. For brunch, the pancakes and hash look wonderful and if I happen in for dinner I would try the Salmon--which would have been my first choice that night, so this just means I need to return on my next trip to the Windy City.Stephani Smiles for OTPH ;)#somanybeerssolittletime", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 2, 6]}, "18": {"description": "A group of my friends came here for dinner at around 7 on a Saturday night.

The broccoli and the bamboo shoot were cooked enough, but still had the needed crunch to to the dish.My boyfriend had the pad thai with duck and it was perfectly smoky, and tender.

Turns out that on the short walk from the restaurant to the El while I was holding the bag by its handles exactly as they had given it to me, almost the entire dish had seeped out of the container and was sloshing around in the bottom of the plastic bag. This was all due to an ill fitting lid on the food container. Then, what I was able to salvage (when I got back to my office) was mediocre at best. The sauce was extremely greasy and barely had a curry or coconut milk flavor. It was basically a bland sauce with some chilies thrown in (I asked for a heat level of 3 out of 6).

I have ordered the same thing from this place every other week for months, and like normal I placed my picked up order and never had an issue. But this time the rudeness from the clerk was beyond belief. Times must be tough bc she tried to charge me for the free hot sauce, when I asked her again she continued to say it was .75 cents. The owner came out and yelled at her for charging guest for free hot sauce. Pick better employees and I hope that .75 cents makes up for the $30 I spend a month.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 8, 7]}, "6": {"description": "I'm not even kidding you when I say I've been ordering the same dish from Thai Aroma for the last 6 years, almost every single Sunday. And by \"almost\" I mean I may have missed a half a dozen Sunday's over the years... Which was most likely due to being out of town traveling someplace or another. I have been known to schedule travel days around Sunday's for this exact reason. No joke. Thai aroma and HBO!! It's what I live for!!Anyway.... Love the potstickers and the sauce (I've never tried another sauce that even comes close to their potsticker sauce). I always order the Jungle Curry medium with chicken and extra veggies. Which is a spicy curry dish without the coconut. Which makes me feel like a little less of a fatty... But it doesn't stop me from eating some of my husband's chicken pad Thai. Every. Single. Time. \"Sorry Adam, I ate half your pad Thai.. Again! \"The only issue I've ever run into over the years is that their brown rice can sometimes been pretty bleh - like over cooked or a day old or something. But it hasn't stopped me from coming back. Every place has problems from time to time. \u00a0Anyway... I look forward to this dish every week! Definitely check it out!

I didn't find it to be very hot, but it was still really quite good. I liked the fresh vegetables quite a bit, and the amount of chicken was surprisingly ample.The small dining room lends itself more toward community discussion (e.g., unavoidable eavesdropping) than intimiate conversation, so this wouldn't be a place to take a date and let her know that the test came back positive.", "rating": "4", "date": [2011, 4, 17]}, "20": {"description": "Food- just okay. Been ordering from them for a while now as they're right by us/our children's' schools. They have unfortunately done a poor job with their recent hires.

But no worries, we ate fast out of our to-go boxes and were almost out in about 20 minutes. Still a small tip was left (about 10%). When I asked for hot sauce, the staff (of one) raised her voice and told me she had \"packed the bag\" herself and there was hot sauce in there. When I said I didn't find one, she proceeded to go to my take out bag to rummage for it! whilst yelling accusatorially. She scared my little kids, and shocked me. To which I promptly asked her for my check back and scratched off her tip, told her that I would ensure my friends in the neighborhood and otherwise would hear of this.
