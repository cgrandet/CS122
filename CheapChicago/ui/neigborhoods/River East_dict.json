I give this place a 5-Yuck rating. First, if you order delivery, plan on your order being wrong and the restaurant not caring at all that they just threw something at you that you did not order and would not eat (but your incorrect order will be delivered super speedy! Yay)... Have you ever seen those FB posts \"You had one job... Epic fails,\" that is Chef's Burger Bistro. If you have a food allergy BEWARE, they do not adhere to a standard that would involve not killing you via anaphylaxis. Second, the fried pickles are not pickles, they are cucumbers (no vinegar, literally, cucumber) in a deep fried coating with zero seasoning. The ranch is a mayo-tartar combo that promptly made me vomit after two bites. The burger bun is the consistency of that \"yoga-mat\" bread and has a rubbery texture and appearance. The \"Bistro Secret Sauce\" is mayo, thousand island, and pickle bits and smells like egg salad that's been left out on a hot summer day. The meat was falling apart because whatever mystery grade beef they use has a dry, particle consistency and can not hold form like a cooked beef patty should. So the summary of this review is: If you enjoy excessive, warm, spoiled mayonnaise, not getting what you ordered, and paying to be poisoned at a super fast delivery speed- This is the place for you! If you actually value customer service, good food, and getting what you paid for- do not ever order from or eat at this place.

When $2.50 is basically your minimum donut price, you've got a problem.

There is only barstool seating against the wall during winter. Summertime offers outdoor space. Because Do-Rite feels pretty much like a \"to-go\" shop that is exactly what I did.

The vanilla bean glazed donut I saved for after dinner was so fluffy and yummy. I am not really a donut person like my dad is. He grew up with his mom fetching donuts from the local bakery every Sunday morning, and he upheld that tradition throughout my childhood and still does today. As a child our neighbors made homemade donuts and would bring us care packages filled with fresh donuts still warm from the fryer. I would sit on the porch eating a donut and listening to my dad and the neighbor, a Korean War vet, swap stories about their time in the service. When I went home for the holidays we had donuts from Greenbush Bakery in Madison, WI on the Sunday before I drove back to Chicago, and of course I was sent home with some excellent old fashioneds. All that is to say I think my dad would like the donuts at Do-Rite.

The anticipation of watching yours being made is half the fun hahaDou: Their fries are the softer kind. I know a few people aren't fans of that, but I don't mind. They give you a fair sized portion too, although I definitely could eat a sandwich and a half because they're just that good. Shiw: And because you're a pig haha. Anyways, this place is great for lunch, but its also good for breakfast because they have donuts too, to give you that savory / sweet combo.

The layout of the restaurant was tucked in the corner so it gets very cramped during peak hours. There are no tables except outside. Clearly when it is cold outside no one wants to sit out there. Service - the cashiers here are always so funny! Especially the gentleman with the glasses. I have gone twice since my initial visit, and the last two times, he has given me a free donut! Wow! Any donut of my choosing!Drinks - basic soda! The second time i visited the diet coke was flat and the ice was out, but again, I assume it was because I went during peak hours. Food - was INSANE. Well, except (ironically) the donuts. but other than that I enjoyed the chicken sandwich and fries VERY much! * French Fries - how can you not love fries?! 4.5 stars. One time I went they were very crisped and too salty, but the other two times were perfect!* CBR Sandwich (spicy). utterly divine to the tastebuds. 5 stars. Chicken is crispy, seasoned to perfection, juicy, spicy, hot.* Old Fashioned. 2 stars. Compared to others like Stan's and Firecakes, you can definitely get better* Maple Bacon. Very nice! 4 stars. The donut itself is moist, the bacon is crisp and maplely, omg. perfect.* Lemon Pistachio. 0 stars. No. I was so confused. I tasted not one trail of lemon.

Always try to make a trip here as early as I can! \u00a0A lot of the more popular ones are gone by 3pm! My favorites are the glazed and the pistachio!

The sandwich is topped with some slaw, and DAT CRUNCH DOE (haha)! The fries were decent but definitely try the sandwich!One thing you should keep in mind is most of the good donuts are gone by 2-3pm!! Another great tip is sometimes when you don't see your favorite donut ask the employees, because sometimes ( very rarely) they are making some in the back so they'll grab it for you! I remember they ran out of glazed in the front, but they decided to make more with the jelly donut dough! \u00a0Also there's one particular employee there who is seriously one of the sweetest people I have ever encountered!

Once in a while PB offers a new item for a limited time but it's almost always a smoothie. Once in the past year a new salad was offered for a short time. \u00a0I can think of several healthy items for breakfast and lunch I've made at home that would be great additions to the menu.While most items are ok, nothing on the menu changes. \u00a0In this day in age with a strong movement towards healthier eating I'd expect better tasting items. \u00a0I'm glad there are a variety of items and options with ingredients for the smoothies (i.e. whey v. soy protein, almond v. skim milk), and I'm glad PB can be a healthier option (only some of the items are really healthy) but after today's buffalo salad, I won't be coming here except for an occasional egg white breakfast bowl or oatmeal.I've had this salad before and it's been fine, nothing to write home about but good enough for a salad. \u00a0The salad I got today for about $10 (a little high IMO) was bland, the chicken was overcooked and the lettuce tasted stale and old. \u00a0If I pay $10 for a high-end salad I really don't want an abundance of the white iceberg lettuce stems as the primary green in the salad. I'd expect more spinach and field greens. I work in the building so I'm often at the food court area but have been avoiding PB except for breakfast as the egg white bowls and oatmeal are adequate for a low cal option (the breakfast burritos are whatever), but after the salad today I should have gone back and asked for something else.The biggest concern upon looking into the ingredients more is the sodium content. \u00a0I think everyone should be aware when they assume because of marketing that PB is a healthy alternative. \u00a0Over 1300mg of sodium in the buffalo salad is flat out INSANE. \u00a0That's more than 50% of your daily sodium intake, in one meal, in a salad. And, the salad is 450 calories to boot. The salads range between 400-500 calories! \u00a0That's nuts!The sodium content is lower in most of the breakfast items because there's no sauce or dressing. \u00a0But, beware of the Sante Fe bowl and burrito. \u00a0Over 1000mg of sodium...thinking about it literally makes me want to drink a gallon of water.Kudos to PB for offering all natural sodas, and healthier snacks like Larabars, smart popcorn, kale chips, individual hard boiled eggs and fresh veggie containers. However, another thing that bothers me...I'd expect everything in the store to be organic. \u00a0The fruits and veggies are not organic. \u00a0I'm not going to pay $7-$8 for a pure juice that's not organic. \u00a0The chicken and beef is not organic, but apparently you can ask for organic beef for an extra cost. \u00a0For these prices you should get organic, there's just no way around it. \u00a0I know in this economy fruits and veggies cost more than things like chips and cookies but if you advertise as a tasty, healthy alternative, then make sure to stick up to that motto and not serve fruits and veggies filled with pesticides. \u00a0And if I'm wrong about this, then advertised where you source your ingredients from. \u00a0It's a bit maddening when I order an organic counter culture coffee and I see the employee pour GFS creamer in my coffee. \u00a0What's the point of organic, fair trade coffee if I can't get organic creamer or milk?I really hope PB refreshes their menu and offers some alternatives because it just gets old. I suppose the same thing could be said for places I go to often, like Chipotle, but the chicken bowl tastes good and I can get it down to 390 calories v. 450 for a mediocre salad that doesn't taste fresh.PB has a burgeoning local chain here that can really do big things but they need to rectify some issues. \u00a0I was so on board with this place that I was touting it with everyone I knew based on the high protein, low fat, lower calorie options. \u00a0Avoiding fried foods and eating things with more veggies or protein is not the only way to a healthier lifestyle. \u00a0You have to have the right balance in your meal options.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 1, 21]}, "37": {"description": "I absolutely LOVED this place.

They still have the Bikes Bites and Brews tour, City Lights tour, Southside Gangster tour and the Museums and Parks at Sunset tour. \u00a0If any are as good as this one, then they will be well worth doing.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 29]}, "3": {"description": "This is our favourite place to rent bikes in Chicago.

However, do not fret novice bike-riders because the people at Bobby's Bike Hike are super professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and really make an effort to not only design a great tour, but to make you feel like you're being take care of in terms of fun and safety. We decided to take the Bikes, Bites, and Brews Tours, which was a great way to see a lot of the city in not a lot of time and a way to tick off a lot of items on your must-eats list. Our guide, Timmy, was FANTASTIC!! (That's right! I used ALL CAPS!) Highly knowledgeable about Chicago history, personable, friendly, responsible, and helpful with the picture-taking and with giving us plenty of photo-ops along the way. The tour has a good mix of bike-riding and food stops. The amount of food stops wasn't too much for us (we didn't have a chance to have breakfast before going on the tour, which I think helped us out) and the beer tasting was toward the end of the tour when you already had food in your stomach. Smart planning. Anyway, I'd recommend the tour, Timmy, and Bobby's to anyone going to visit Chicago.

However, Men's Suit New York was not having a clearance sale as they are just wholesale retailers of men's apparel. If you're looking for affordable suits (i.e. less than $500), this is a great place to shop. I used to work at Jos A. Bank, and while I like their suits, they aren't as modern as some of suits found here (Calvin Klein, and many Italian brands including Hugo Boss). The sales associate wasn't too pushy, but was all too eager to bring new suits to show me. He was knowledgeable though (but I already know a bit about suits myself). I didn't end up buying a suit for Curtis, but I really will keep this place in mind when he needs one for an upcoming event.", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 9, 7]}, "0": {"description": "CLOSED.

However, there are a few things that I wish had been cleared up or could have been better. I loved that this salon was a BYOB and food place! Our party loved that. I do think it needs to be clarified that the \"party space\" is not private. There is a table set up for food/beverages, but no chairs to sit on and you are open to the whole salon. 1 out of 6 of our girls actually got a wash and blow-dry. I was really disappointed with the blow out service. The other 5 of us just had our hair styled with flat irons. A Blow out is fun because it's not something that I do at home regularly but I do use a curing or flat iron. It was so disappointing. My stylist made me look like a Texas pageant queen and hair sprayed the crap out of my hair. (Not the look i was going for at all) nor what i wanted, which I said \"a little curl with some volume\". I couldn't wait to get home and wash my hair. It was a waste of money! It was awful. I've never ever had a blow-out where my hair is stiff with spray. It seemed like the salon didn't have enough people or time to do washes for all of us?The mani/pedis were half assed. We didn't get a soaking tub for the pedicure, no foot scrub, no lotion, no massage. Same for the manicure. The manicurest was wonderful and dud a great job...but the mani/pedi we received was pretty piss poor.Makeup was beautiful on all of us! Paperwork/contract to the salon stated that they would call 24 hours prior to event to confirm, they did not. I had sent in via email, the contract to Nicole and never heard anything from the salon after 2 emails, so I called to make sure we were booked. Salon is cash only tip. We were quoted $132 per person with gratuity added on... once we got to the salon we we told our total was $115 plus the 20% gratuity, which we had to pay in cash. None of us were prepared for a cash tip... would've been nice to know ahead of time.Overall, it was a fun day of getting \"pretty\". A few areas of disappointment, but not enough to stop me from recommending this to other Bachelorette or party. I would say, there are some areas of improvement.

He was definitely a fan.Despite the lore, Garrett's popcorn totally lives up to the hype! It's fantastic and I thought the price was quite reasonable considering all its fanfare. You can sample various flavors, but our favorite was the Caramel Pecan! It's just the right salty sweet combo! Delicious!

I assumed that restaurants did research on these kinds of things so that they would know customer expectations, but obviously they saved some money by skipping that step.

This place is rather hidden on Ontario St as people don't seem to eat at the restaurants along this less-traveled street. The place is big with plenty of tables but there were only a few tables there on a 7pm weeknight. We were greeted by a friendly employee upon walking in. We took a few minutes to decide what to order. They were out of the sushi rolls with tuna in them. Bummer. We ordered Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Original and Thai Dynamite Steak Original with a fountain drink.The Pei Wei Spicy Chicken was super sour and sweet. t wasn't that spicy despite the abundance of bright red pepper flakes. We inhaled the steam from the food and coughed from the vinegar smell in the dish. The snap peas were super fresh and crunchy. The circle-cut orange slices might look boring but added a firm sweetness to the dish. It was served with plenty of white rice. The chicken was breaded and deep-fried so it added a nice crunch to the dish. There seemed to be plenty of chicken, too. Yay!The Thai Dynamite (Steak) was a favorite of the employee taking our order. I thought it was okay - I would try another dish next time. The steak was lightly breaded and deep fried and there was a small amount of thick sauce. The beef pieces were crunchy and settled atop a bed of sliced green onions and red peppers. The dish seemed to have a lot of salty seasoning and the green onion and red pepper didn't suffice to minimize the saltiness. The brown rice I ordered with the dish, however, helped balance out the saltiness but it was a bit dry. Luckily, I had a fountain drink.The fountain drink served to quench my thirst. One of the machines was almost completely out of order. Perhaps only 2-3 soda brands were available. The working machine, located closer to the kitchen and on the left side of the back counter, gave the drink a weird, almost algae-like taste to the drinks. I tried different drinks (orange coke, sprite, ginger ale, sprite with peach) and they all had this weird taste to it. I wonder if it was the pipe on the machine that had algae on it or the water pipe servicing the machine that had algae in it or the water source servicing the machine that had algae in it. I'm not sure what it was but the soda tasted off.The service here is excellent. The team members seem to get along well with each other and the server who brought food to our table told us what the dishes were as they brought them out to us. Service was quick and the employee who took our order asked us if we had any questions when we were ordering, which was nice of her.The ambiance is very nice. The lighting is great as it's very well-lit and bright. The dark tables go well with the brick walls and the restrooms are quite clean. I'd like to come back again to try out their other dishes such as the Pad Thai next time. I'll give the fountain drinks another try, too.

Despite the postings, I convinced the wife we should walk around the corner from our apartment and sample the \"Five Unique Flavors From Five Asian Food Styles\".So, the first sign of a bad restaurant experience? Completely, and utterly, empty dining room on a Sunday night at 7:00pm. Second sign? Only one guy working the sushi bar, while also staffing the empty kitchen. Third bad sign? Not an Asian in sight. The menu options are pretty simple - a small offering of four and eight-piece sushi slices, including a Mango California Roll for just $3.50 for the four-piece and $6.99 for the eight piece Spicy Tuna Roll. Entrees are offered as stir-fried, or \"Wok'd\", where you pick out your protein - chicken, veggies or tofu for $8.69 or Steak or Shrimp for $9.69. You then select your rice - a glop of greasy brown or Spackle-like white ... or for a $1 upcharge you can take your chances with the rice noodles or fried rice. Toss in an extra buck or two for \"spicy\" sauce or extra protein. We decided on the Wok'd Orange Peel Steak and the Kung Pao Shrimp, along with a four piece of Spicy Tuna Roll and Sweet-n-Sour soup.First, the soup was so gelatinous and grossly thick from being over cornstarched, that the heavy, china spoon actually stood straight up in the bowl - see the photo above. Absolutely disgusting.The Wok'd entrees were tasteless, with both proteins saturated in the same bright red sauce, despite being completely different orders. The shrimp were rubbery and overcooked, the green beans were completely raw. My carrots in the Orange Peel Steak were so hard and rubbery, I thought they were boiled poker chips. The meat was chewy and could have passed for overcooked chicken.Service was minimal - three people delivered the sushi and two entrees -each about three minutes apart. We never saw the server again.

This place is rather hidden on Ontario St as people don't seem to eat at the restaurants along this less-traveled street. The place is big with plenty of tables but there were only a few tables there on a 7pm weeknight. We were greeted by a friendly employee upon walking in. We took a few minutes to decide what to order. They were out of the sushi rolls with tuna in them. Bummer. We ordered Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Original and Thai Dynamite Steak Original with a fountain drink.The Pei Wei Spicy Chicken was super sour and sweet. t wasn't that spicy despite the abundance of bright red pepper flakes. We inhaled the steam from the food and coughed from the vinegar smell in the dish. The snap peas were super fresh and crunchy. The circle-cut orange slices might look boring but added a firm sweetness to the dish. It was served with plenty of white rice. The chicken was breaded and deep-fried so it added a nice crunch to the dish. There seemed to be plenty of chicken, too. Yay!The Thai Dynamite (Steak) was a favorite of the employee taking our order. I thought it was okay - I would try another dish next time. The steak was lightly breaded and deep fried and there was a small amount of thick sauce. The beef pieces were crunchy and settled atop a bed of sliced green onions and red peppers. The dish seemed to have a lot of salty seasoning and the green onion and red pepper didn't suffice to minimize the saltiness. The brown rice I ordered with the dish, however, helped balance out the saltiness but it was a bit dry. Luckily, I had a fountain drink.The fountain drink served to quench my thirst. One of the machines was almost completely out of order. Perhaps only 2-3 soda brands were available. The working machine, located closer to the kitchen and on the left side of the back counter, gave the drink a weird, almost algae-like taste to the drinks. I tried different drinks (orange coke, sprite, ginger ale, sprite with peach) and they all had this weird taste to it. I wonder if it was the pipe on the machine that had algae on it or the water pipe servicing the machine that had algae in it or the water source servicing the machine that had algae in it. I'm not sure what it was but the soda tasted off.The service here is excellent. The team members seem to get along well with each other and the server who brought food to our table told us what the dishes were as they brought them out to us. Service was quick and the employee who took our order asked us if we had any questions when we were ordering, which was nice of her.The ambiance is very nice. The lighting is great as it's very well-lit and bright. The dark tables go well with the brick walls and the restrooms are quite clean. I'd like to come back again to try out their other dishes such as the Pad Thai next time. I'll give the fountain drinks another try, too.

The wait staff was very friendly, and, even though they were busy, we never once felt rushed to order or finish our meals.The pan-seared yellowfin tuna with pasta that I had was pretty good. It was tasty, but a tiny bit dry (despite my asking for it medium rare). I would, however, recommend the tuna salad (tried someone else's and thought that was better).

What kept me at For Eyes for so long was their bargain prices--it sure wasn't their high-fashion frames. But their prices are no longer any lower than anyone else's, and my new vision insurance doesn't cover them, so time to move on. Spex, however, is covered, and I have walked by their window and seen their stylish frames, so looks like the perfect place to move on to!First the exam. Victor performs a few tests and explains the purpose of each one and gives an outline of the result. Then the doctor completes the exam. OK. I need you to understand that I have worn glasses and/or contacts since I was 10 years old, so I've been through a few eye exams. Between Victor and Jenny, no exam has ever been so thorough, and so well-explained to me. They explained what each test was looking for and what the results should look like. I was even shown the imaging results!On to choosing frames. The selection is rather small. Usually opticians have what seems like a thousand different choices of frames, with at least 80% of them being of a style that your grandfather would nut punch you if you suggested he wear them even as a joke. So you try to make your choice among the remaining 200 frames which are all similar to each other and to the glasses you see on every bespectacled person you see.Not here.Here, there are only a few cases of frames organized by designer. But nothing fugly or cheap- or common-looking. ALL of their frames are gorgeous! Instead of \u00a0trying to choose between two or three frames that wouldn't make me hate my face too much, I had to choose among several frames that I loved! And since my fashion sense isn't the greatest, I really appreciated the advice of Dave, who made suggestions as to which frames fit my face shape best. He even ordered my choice of frames in a color that was not available in the store.And now the sale. Instead of getting a receipt with my charge on the bottom and zero explanation of the charges, Dave not only printed out a very detailed receipt with all charges AND how they would be covered by insurance or by me, he also explained it to me and made sure I understood how all charges were made and applied.So yes.

Beware of getting a prescription here and glasses made elsewhere.I went to Spex back in February to get an eye exam done. I had intended to buy some frames and get glasses made elsewhere as Spex had told me that their frames started around $250 and ranged up to $900, which is way more than I wanted to spend, so I made an appointment for the exam and wanted to walk out with my prescription. I had a pleasant experience at the store and the staff was very friendly, and I walked out with my prescription (which I was told was slightly worse than my current pair of glasses), which ultimately turned out to be wrong. Not knowing that at the time, I ordered some glasses from Warby Parker from their store in Old Town. Given my high prescription, it took quite a few weeks to get my glasses in. Knowing that with my prescription it takes a few days to adjust to new lenses, I went through a few days of forcing myself to wear them, thinking something was pretty off. Nevertheless, I chalked it up to the adjustment period. 3-4 days later, things hadn't improved, and I put my old glasses back on, where things were much better. I returned the Warby Parker glasses and chalked it up to a mistake on their end. After some time of putting my frames search on the back burner, I went to LensCrafters, who made my previous glasses. Upon receiving them, I had similar issues - tried wearing the glasses for a few days, took them back to LC a few times and they tried a few adjustments, until ultimately they looked up my prescription history and noticed my that my old and new prescription were very different (new was weaker; despite Spex telling me my eyes had gotten a little worse, and the astigmatism correction was completely different). I called Spex and was told too much time had passed by (it had been about 6-8 months) and they would charge me $35 to come back in. I thought this was pretty unfair given the prescription is supposed to be valid for 12 months from the date of exam, and since I didn't really have a lot of trust in them, I opted to get a redo exam at LensCrafters instead, which showed that my prescription had not changed at all. The doc at LC even changed her exam tools to show me what the prescription Spex gave me was, and it was not even close. Since I remember being able to see pretty well at Spex during the eye exam, I can only assume that the doc there had written the prescription down wrong. Unfortunately, that led to a lot of lost time and confusion in trying to get new glasses, extra cost to me to redo the eye exam at LC, and while I can forgive the mistake, telling me they'd have to charge me extra to double check my prescription within the same time it was valid didn't strike me as the best customer service.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 10, 13]}, "49": {"description": "Yes it is that time of the year again, time to see my eye doctor, get new glasses.

I stopped him and explained the style of grams I was looking for, and he told me that with my \"fat face shape\" that I couldn't have what I wanted. He then continued to hand me outrageously priced frames. I desperately needed glasses, so I quickly found a pair a liked within my price range and tried to move on.

He told me the order total, which was through the roof, and said I wouldn't get my glasses for two months. When I asked to see the bill and details, I realized he didn't account for my insurance, which I had asked about numerous times. I told him that I know my insurance covers their services, and he literally said \"you got me.\" This man tried to scam me, and tried to again with a second bill. Furious, I told him to cancel the order that I didn't authorize to begin with. He got visibly upset at me for not accepting his horrendous actions.

Previously, I had made the mistake of purchasing from the Oliver Peoples retail store and had not been able to get reimbursed from my insurance. I probably could have, but they couldn't do it directly at the store level, which created too much red tape on my end. At Spex, I only paid around $150 for Prada prescription sunglasses with my insurance.The service from start to finish was phenomenal. I had my exam elsewhere so I can't speak to that--only the customer service in selecting and purchasing frames. The friendly young gentleman was very helpful and in tune with what I was seeking. He even politely asked other customers their opinions, which he could tell I was open to based on my personality. I'm thrilled with the fashion-forward look of my frames yet they definitely are not over the top since they need to be appropriate in business settings as well. They arrived promptly. When I came to pick them up, the woman greeted me warmly, had me try them on, and the frames fit perfectly. When I was ready to go, she handed me a yellow rose for getting a new pair of glasses! I was completely surprised by the kind gesture! It was a simple act, but all day people asked me where I got the rose and I told them the story. Now I want more pairs of glasses so I can get more of these beautiful long-stemmed roses! \u00a0:)I've purchased designer frames from eyeglass boutiques in a number of large cities and Spex exhibited more genuine concern and friendliness in their service than any other shop.

It was the worst Starbucks I had ever encountered, but it was close to where I was staying. I complained (very politely) to the company about the filthy conditions of the store. Starbucks said it was because of the types of customers there, they tried to keep it clean, but my best option was to get my coffee somewhere else (at another Starbucks, of course). My reaction was to avoid Starbucks whenever possible. I have since found some great locations, a lot of OK locations, and a few mediocre ones. This one is the worst. It is a block from my home, so I go there occasionally. Until about 18 months ago, it was a great little shop, busy but comfortable and friendly. Then it changed management and it has been downhill ever since. I believe they use this one for training, because the baristas (and managers) seem to change monthly. About a year ago I complained to Starbucks that this location was usually dirty and that the staff did not seem to have any interest in keeping it clean. Starbucks Corporate's response this time was that they couldn't identify having a location at Ontario and McClurg. I guess I was dreaming.I have noticed a very clear deterioration the past few months. Today was my last visit. Apparently, there was a plumbing problem and everyone was told to leave. The guy at the table next to me was asking if he could finish his cup of coffee and the answer was \"no, you will have to leave\". The employee was extraordinarily rude to him. I was just amused thinking that Starbucks must have completely removed customer service training from their employee training. In any case, I left, along with the other half dozen customers who were told to leave in middle of drinking their coffees or eating the crap Starbucks calls \"food\" \u00a0(including people on the outside tables who were told they couldn't sit there any longer). I guess they didn't want to pay the employees to keep the place open for another 1/2 hour if they couldn't sell anything.Please, Starbucks, just shut this pathetic location down.

I've been getting pretty crappy/weak coffee at Starbucks for the past year in one of their small-town shops.

Seems obvious they've gone that route to up the profit by reducing the pack of the grind for shots (if we want it stronger, we have to BUY another shot.

The weak shots could be because the machine's grind isn't fine enough, or it's not packed tightly enough, and/or insufficient water temperature. Whatever it is, they've destroyed the product. And the fresh taste is GONE. Maybe the grind is done hours in advance.What is also obvious is a drop in patrons. The Streeterville location used to be twice as busy during the morning rush. Noticed 7-Eleven just across the street was crawling with business at the time -- now THEY serve better coffee (than Starbucks), and it's just the old BUN drip!Starbucks no longer means a great cup of coffee.

Still flaky after reheating. I ignored the side dishes, and only ate the salmon because it reminded me of the first dish I ever cooked with my best friend in Alaska: Orange-ginger salmon. The dish made me nostalgic of the orange-ginger salmon I had, because this dish was the result of a new partnership between Mike and Eva. Friendships and so much more can be built on the premise of cooking dishes rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to the food, the service was impeccable. Each plate was presented with a beautiful smile from the hostess, and the host made conversation. He was genuinely interested in how we thought the food was prepared and tasted.

When a saleslady (the only one that was semi-helpful the whole time) pointed me upstairs, I was thankful. When I described the tank I was looking for to the lady up there, she waved her hand in a general direction and walked away. I did not find the tank.Then I went to try on the pants. The same more helpful lady gave me a couple of pairs and I headed to the fitting room. WHen I needed a different size, I asked the lady there and she made a \"uhh\" sound and rolled her eyes, said \"fine\" and went looking for the black pants. When she came back with complete different jeans (not pants) and said \"this is all I could find\" I said, \"they are jeans, not black pants!\" She just looked annoyed and I said never mind, took off the black, funny fitting pants, and left the fitting room.At this point, I was slightly annoyed, so I just wanted to exchange my tights and leave. I had bought 2 pairs of smalls by following the chart on the back. When I put on the first pair, the crotch came to about my knee. Sizes were WAY off. I wanted to exchange the pair I had not opened for a medium. I did not have my receipt, but thought since I was just exchanging for a different size it would be a problem. They did not have the exact pattern. but one that was pretty much exactly the same. They even had the same \"2 for $20\" sticker on them that mine had. I settled for those, but the lady at the counter wanted me to pay over $10 saying that she couldn't be sure I didn't get my pair for less. My pair were a much more intricate and nicer design, and they were both the same material, same price marked, some stickers. I told her I wasn't trying to get money, just exchange for the right size. She was rude and unhelpful. I ended up leaving with my original tights, no pants, and no tanks.I will not shop at this location ever again.SOOOOOO Rude, unhelpful, and acted too \"good\" to help a customer.It was not a busy night either.

Worst Gap I've been to. Mostly because of staff with attitude, which may be attributable to a big store, which seems to be understaffed or incredibly disorganized. There were 3 sales associates on the floor. 2 in the fitting room. I had placed some items on reserve and came to this location to pick them up. There were 12 people in line and 3 cashiers working but after waiting about 10 minutes in line, and not much movement, I decided to go to the fitting room and ask the sales associate in the fitting room to grab the items so that I didn't have to stand in a long line for no reason. I say no reason b/c if I tried the items on and decided they were unsuitable, then I needn't have stood in line with all the people there to return/exchange/purchase. If I did find them suitable then I'd have to stand in line to get the items, which are hanging off to the side on a rack between the cash wrap and fitting room, stand in line again to try the items on, then stand in line a third time to purchase them. Possibly a fourth time queuing up to get another fitting room, if I had to go find a different size. Which I did. What annoys me most is that the staff in the fitting room and on the floor kept passing the buck to someone else so they wouldn't have to pull an item off the reserve rack. \u00a0They were so exasperated that I asked them to do a job that would take less than 2 seconds. Literally. And I actually mean literally b/c that's how long it took for the angry woman on the floor who sighed loudly when I sought out her help by saying excuse me. Then she pushed a cart with a few articles of clothing on it and barreled through the store knocking over an entire pile of shorts on the floor in the process. Lol and there was no one around her even. She was just in a bad mood or didn't want to be at work I guess. I first asked the girl in the fitting room if she could just grab the items for me. I could see the items on the reserve rack. Even though she was less than an arms length away from the reserved items, she told to go to the cashier. Then she walked a further distance than it would have taken her to just grab the reserved items to see that the line had wrapped around by now. She then told me to just ask anyone on the floor. Annoyed that she was so unwilling to help but understanding that she might be really busy or not allowed to do anything but \"man\" the fitting room, I browsed the floor for a sales associate. There were none. None! There was someone who seemed to be a manager who was running around to grab things from behind the sliding walls, but she was obviously occupied. I finally found the Queen of Attitude on the floor rolling the cart around. She wasn't folding anything or putting anything away, so I said, \"Excuse me could I get some help?\" She stopped pushing the cart. Without even turning around she sighed loudly and pushed forward with the cart. She didn't stop until she was in the fitting room and then she turns around and puts a hand on her hip and lifts her eyebrow. I thought this was rude even if she was having a rough day, but asked her if she could help me get the items, which were now less than a foot away from her. Then verbatim, she snapped, \"Name.\"I told her. She yanked it off the reserve rack then said, \"Here.\"Then stomped off. I waited in line for a fitting room to become available. While in line I saw her complain to the other fitting room attendant who first told me to go to the cash register then ask anyone else on the floor. Many of us have been in that position and had a long day or week. I still think it's poor form to complain about working or their job within earshot of customers. Complain with your coworkers or friends/fam after work. At the very least, be discrete about not wanting to be at work. When I get a fitting room, \u00a0I hear the fitting room attendant ask several people if they need other sizes. When the customers asked for a different size, she referred them to go look for it themselves. One woman had a stroller with a baby and looked frazzled but she was told that the item should be available on the floor. Why did the fitting room attendant even bother asking if she needed another size? Oh and it was laughable how messy and unclean the fitting rooms were. I'm laughing to myself even now. It looked like a hoarder had come to Gap. Clearly they were overwhelmed. They had thrown everything into a huge pile at least 3 if not 4 ft tall. In addition to the piles on the cart and clothes strewn across the rack. I wanted to take a picture of the mess but didn't think they'd allow it.Overall, I purchased some items, and despite the location, I will not return to this location.

Service continued to be awkward, so much so that I thought they couldn't have been open more than a few days but I was incorrect on that assumption. Though I was seated in a booth, (on the bar side but a ways from the bar) the bartender was my server. She brought my wine and I didn't think to request bread, I waited on it, but it never arrived. it was only after my lukewarmish pasta dish was brought from the kitchen after some time by a line person did I realize that I should request the bread. And the fresh grated parm. And maybe go behind the bar and pour myself another glass of Chardonnay. I had to summon the only person passing by - a different host than the three by whom I'd already been greeted - and he brought out the fresh-grated parm. The bread arrived shortly after by the busboy. Although I was several tables back and there was a Bulls game on, I unfortunately was still privy to hearing one suited gentleman scold a hostess about having left the podium. Maybe she off was filling someone's water! Obviously, service issues prevailed.

From their cafe section we have tried three of their pizzas, the pepperoni, veggie one, and the BBQ mozzarella one. Also, we've had one of their burgers, an Italian beef sandwich and one of their salads, it's been a while and unfortunately I can't remember the names. We have found that the food is kind of hit or miss. My boyfriend really likes the pizza, I personally think it's too charred and way too light/thin. However the pepperoni one was quite good, but this last one he had the BBQ mozzarella was really thin, soggy he had to fold the pieces backwards for everything to not fall off and we didn't taste any bbq. The veggie one had this kind of strange overbearing vegetable-y taste lol I know it's a veggie pizza but still unexpected flavor. When we got the BBQ mozzarella I also ordered their Italian beef sandwich which was unfortunately underwhelming and full of issues. The beef was just lukewarm and in this wierd compressed shape, I thought they had given me a sausage at first but it was just all stuck together which made me think it was frozen and just heated up. Secondly, it was on a type of overly stiff, crusty fancy rustic looking sandwich roll which I felt was totally inappropriate for Italian beef, anywhere else gives it to you on a plain white French bread type sandwich roll which feels and tastes better with beef. I remember the burger and salad being good. We have found that the later it is the lower our food quality for some reason.

I went for lunch and sat on the restaurant side not realizing that there was a cafe side (which is the menu I had looked at online) so it was a little more money than I usually spend for lunch time.First, our waiter was a bit...off. He tried a lot of upselling, which I get he probably has to do, but I just wanted a casual experience with a business colleague without having to say \"no thank you\" every few minutes. He also offered us a bellini and when we refused as it was a business lunch, he made a weird comment about how he thought it was Saturday. Off. Now about the food: the calamari to start was amazing - lightly breaded, little slices of hot peppers, and overall yummy. I really appreciated the two ramekins of sauce so I had my own for dipping. I asked for the eggplant parm as a sandwich instead of pasta and after checking, he gladly accommodated. I was excited for the parm after great calamari, but was sadly disappointed. The bread was good, but the overall sandwich was so salty and totally fell apart in my hands making a business lunch a little embarrassing to eat and eventually I resorted to my fork and knife. It was sad not to enjoy my eggplant parm, usually my favorite dish to order. The salt was that overwhelming. And to compound the issue, my water glass was frequently needing a refill to counteract all the salt. I finished half my sandwich with no water in my glass before a busboy finally came by to fill it up again.Now about the coffee on the cafe side - it didn't seem like they were set up and it took over 10 minutes to get a simple americano as the guy who I asked what line to get in said I could use the coffee stand (vs. longer cafe line) and then disappeared coming back a few minutes later. No one else came by to help until he returned and when I paid in cash, he disappeared again, another worker showed up with a $10 for change in the machine all while the guy was off somewhere getting my change. It was very confusing and a bad customer service experience after salty food. The calamari started with such promise! Not sure I'll return.

During a peak period, I ate there 2-3 days per week for lunch or dinner for an entire year. I adored this restaurant and I can't say I've ever had a bad meal there. Due to a move back to the city, I haven't been to the Oak Brook location in a couple of years.So recently I learned that Labriola opened a restaurant in downtown Chicago. I was thrilled. Since I love this restaurant (especially the Richie burger, salads, and pizza) I decided to finally stop in. My only concern was whether or not the food would be consistent with my experience at the other location.I had an early lunch (around 11:15A) and I ordered the Richie burger. \u00a0I found my food to be the polar opposite of what I was used to. The burger was the driest burger I have ever eaten in my life. The pretzel bun was unheated and tasted bland. The bacon was very thin. The cheese was yellow instead of white and covered only half the burger. The lettuce has paltry and anemic looking. The burger was also not seasoned and quite tasteless. It was also just warm instead of piping hot. As I was eating the burger, I couldn't believe how flavorless and dry it was. I began to wonder if this was a leftover burger that someone threw in the microwave to heat up.As a big lover of the Richie burger, this meal was a huge disappointment. I was planning to treat a friend from work to a meal here and to also bring family members. Well, that's clearly not going to happen now, because I'm not wasting another cent in this restaurant.I don't understand why they would have a location right off the Mag Mile and not make sure the experience is equal to or better than the Oak Brook location. I was hoping to eat here a couple of times per month. Oh well.Additionally, I tried the buttermilk donut. It unfortunately had a bad greasy aftertaste and the water glass that I was given was dirty. My advice - if you love the Oak Brook location be cautious about eating here, because the food may not taste as good.

After ordering from the television monitors above the register, we walked over to the dining area to find a smattering of food and crumbs on the floor and tables - nothing too discouraging, just more of a post-rush hour dusting of debris than a time-to-start-a-new-day look for 11:30am.Our food arrived very quickly, delivered tableside by a waiter we never saw again - my soup and sandwich combo included a half tuna salad sammich, topped with fennel and olives, perched on a large bagel-like onion roll that was a bit too thick to tackle. The soup of the day was a rich and flavorful creamy tomato soup ($9.95) - one of the freshest I have ever sampled. The tuna was just how I hoped - lightly dressed, with just enough fennel to make it taste like it had a little pickle relish in the mix. The wife's plate overflowed with fresh-cut, super-crispy potato chips and her prosciutto-wrapped chicken panini ($9.95) was welded together by a thick layer of gooey provolone cheese, some fresh spinach, slices of dried tomato, dressed with a pesto mayo.Both sandwiches were certainly flavorful and came at a very decent price point, considering the proximity to Michigan Ave. We look forward to trying them again.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 26]}, "57": {"description": "Arrived and were promptly seated with our reservation.

Now- I hadn't been since they started weighing food at the registers, so I asked for help having the only decent looking/ripe Apple they had weighed, the employee lightly shook his head and carried on with what he was doing and did not tell me they weigh up front. Bakery:Younger- fast service, though they did lose one birthday cake once, but that's out of multiple a year for over a decade, one isn't THAT bad and it was easy to replace.Now- I bake a lot, but one thing I'll never give up is bakery frosting. The bakery no longer looks like somewhere I'll be buying from. Yes, the decorations look nice, but the icing looks warmer than it should be and the cakes all look like they've been sitting there for weeks and they're not even boxed, just in a container that's being opened constantly through the day and very easy for bugs or ants to make their way in. No thanksRegisters:Younger- they were friendly, they knew who I was and they asked about school/life/ whatever Now- I understand that I've changed over the years and that they've had a change in employees, but I worked as a cashier in a grocery store and you damn well better believe that I asked every customer how they were and provided extremely quick service. The line took WAY too long, I don't know if I just never noticed this because it was the grocery store I always went to or if the employees have slowed it down a lot but I always remember there being excessive lines. They didn't even look at or talk to me they were talking with the next cashier over. I understand talking to friends who work with you, but when you have a customer, talk to them, or at least say hello. Don't be rude. All in all, this place has gone down hill over the years. I got better service when they knew who I was but now I'm just another customer most of them have never seen before and I've been learning how they treat the customers that don't come in daily- not good.

Granted I know it was only a dime but I asked for future references if that was the wrong price. The lady seriously stared at me with a dirty look like I just killed her first born. Then she rolled her eyes at me and walked away. A response would've been suffice but she had to pull out the theatrics. The deli manager is just as bad if not worse. She is blatantly rude to costumers and frequently makes inappropriate remarks. I have witnessed this first hand several times so I know to stay away from her.

I am not complaining about the prices because I get it, they have to be higher due to the location. But I have picked up several items that look like they have been there since the dawn of time. I picked up a container of ovaltine and the dust on top was like an inch thick. At this point you are probably wondering, \"Why does this chick keep going if she hates it?\" Well I'm glad you asked, they sell soda by the can for 60 cents.

I was so impressed and from that moment realized why she is so busy because she is just naturally dedicated to her profession and her class showed thru because what made her so successful is her professionalism and customer service first her talent wow I have never had an opportunity prior to tonight to have my new extensions hair color and cut done so amazingly it is hands down the best haircut and color I ever have had in my life and she just did it like she knew and I didn't even have to say one thing plus she just knew exactly how to put in my new hair extensions and she uses SHE by SO CAP which I have come to realize is the best but even the way she fuses the extensions is so different than anyone else I mean you can barely even see the bond ... I mean Jordyn is 27 years old that's it yet her ability is absolutely flawless which I feel can only come from someone smart enough to understand that to become great you must learn and that takes real humility she even just put the extensions right in my bangs which was exactly what I wanted but since no one had ever done it I figured it wasn't possible but the way Jordyn handles those bonds which is amazing and like no one else and she just knew and she just took the time to make sure it was done and done right She began my hair tonight at 5 pm and without one complaint took out my old extensions highlighted my hair washed it and put in the new extensions beautifully and with a complete full head taking that extra time to create these tiny bonds which feel like nothing in my hair and did my entire head plus the bangs cut my hair and we walked out of her salon at 10:40 pmAnd I am not sure I even have heard of any in my life even salon owners who would do all of that not only in that amount of time but she made those hours with her seem like nothing and I have been so sick the past almost 4 months and physically am still struggling to look better and Jordyn just made me feel so much better and did all of that for me with a smile on her face the entire time There is something very special about Jordyn she is one of the classiest people I have ever met with such a grace ease and beauty but with an understanding of people and maturity beyond her years Through out the darkest time in my life Jordyn who because of my circumstances fit me into her very busy schedule and I literally mean that I love my hair my hair color how she did my extensions and I mean it's the best of all three I have ever had and I mattered to her Just like anyone would what I respect the most is that is exactly how she treats every single one of her clients every time And tonight for the first time in months I smiled and felt better about myself as a woman I am 43 years old so one can say I have just had more years to try and find the best salon the best stylist and it took this long but I finally did and Jordyn is the best I have ever had Everything you hear is true she is the real deal and she has studied under the best and worked really hard and it shows No matter what you need done Jordyn is the one to contact period and I know she will make the time cause she is a true professional and if you need hair extensions hands down Jordyn is who you go too It will be the best decision you will make and will feel exactly as I do afterwards all of her clients are dead on right about her Chicago is incredibly lucky to have her it's the truth JORDYN IS THE BEST IN CHICAGO And no one can argue with the truth Thank you Jordyn", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 7, 7]}, "33": {"description": "Jordan is such an amazing stylist! she got me in on such short notice for New Years and my hair turned out perfect! it stayed all night and I was getting compliment after compliment.

Disclaimer: Jordyn did NOT do my hair or makeup and I think that's where the problems arose. I made an appointment online through an automated system that is clearly flawed. It sent me 1000 text messages and emails before I'd even gotten close to my appointment time, never mind the day of. Just too many. Then the times for my makeup got mixed up and caused stress, but it was fixed fairly easily.I showed up and met the vibrant and bubbly Jordyn and wished I had known more about this place so I could have made a better decision. I definitely would have gone with her doing everything. She's put together and just gorgeous. I had an appointment to have makeup/hair done for a very important photo shoot/event the day of. I was paired with Madison for makeup and Camrin for hair. I walked in and had to find this little bitty room of a salon. Not typical at all and had I known that this was the way it was set up I definitely would have made a different choice. My mistake. Camrin and Madison were both the sweetest. I really loved their outgoing personalities and how kind and accommodating they were. I had made an appointment for a blowout with Camrin but when I sat down and got ready to have it done she pulls out these HUGE rollers. I have never in my life gotten a blowout with rollers. I expressed my hesitation and said that wasn't what I was looking for but was assured it would be fine. I showed her a picture of what I wanted with curls and was told she could do that. Camrin would blow out tiny sections of hair, one at a time, and then put a roller in. My roots are curly and she wasn't really getting those. It was really not a blowout. Then she gave me the curls I asked for and they doubled the cost of my blowout, but they didn't tell me until it was already done. I wouldn't have paid $55 for someone to curl my hair. My blowouts in NYC (that I get twice a week) are the same price whether I blow it straight, have it flat ironed, or curled. This was a VERY overpriced hairstyle. It also lasted one day.

My makeup was horrible and I had to do it all myself for my photo shoot. She used drug store products and was just not good at it. I was devastated.

The cashier- finished with taking my order- then turned to the foodstuffs and stared like a toy robot run out of batteries.This was so awkward to witness that I took a seat and pretended to have other things to think about. After a while a manager appeared and began to help the cashier with my order. Things seemed to be picking up in pace. The manager then came to me and asked me to confirm my latte order.\"A chai latte... you want a shot of espresso seperate?\"\"No, in it.\"\"Oh, well, different strokes for different folks I suppose! Have a great day, okay? And come back, we're a new location!\"She then poured the shot in with a broad, sincere smile. I picked up the cup and immediately noticed it was really light. I sipped, and there was barely a drop of milk or chai in it, just 90% foam and a shot of espresso in a small puddle of latte. I looked up at the manager- she was still smiling at me. She'd done it on purpose due to some twisted money saving logic! If I had any sense of aggression in my personality whatsoever, I would have protested. But no, let's be clear- when you complain about a coffee beverage a piece of your soul withers forever. You did, after all, ask an underpaid retch to fetch you a drug. Talking down to them makes you an addict so vile you may as well be on heroin. So unless the mistake is fatal (or you are a sociopath) it is very difficult to take a barista to task. So I let my glance linger on the manager... Her smile faltered as my lower eyelids raised themselves in a squint. That's right... I am writing a motherfucking Yelp review about this. I know you're trying to be nice, and maybe it was even a mistake, but you held this cup and you know it's practically empty. You can't pretend you don't know what happened here!

Then she says, \"I'll be right back to take your order\" - we were trying to politely say \"we can tell you now it's just a burger and a salad!\" But she ignored us, not for one minute, but for 20. When we finally ordered, I told the waitress I had a wheat allergy and double-checked the calamari is sans croutons. No extra requests, she confirmed it doesn't come with croutons and I ordered off the menu as-is. \u00a0It showed up with no lettuce and extra croutons. It was just calamari, tomatoes and croutons on an appetizer plate - are you kidding me?? This is now 90 minutes in. We just tell her to take it off the bill and well cash out because it's inedible. She says, \"that might take a minute, our managers are really backed up.\" SHOCKING. Horribly managed, horribly serviced, bland bad cold food. And we weren't the only ones to be given dishes not even made to menu description. They get their 18%, why should they care? It's on the beach and people will come no matter what must be the mantra.

They get five stars for friendly and always there to help you find stuff employees as well.

Now, the reason that I'm giving only three stars- their prices. In fact, the three stars are an average I got by giving their prices zero stars. Today I decided to go grocery shopping in the area and avoided whole foods because there's no doubt they'd be the priciest option. I chose bockwinkels for the above mentioned reasons yet I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I reached for grapefruit bits that cost 1.29 in target (1.99 here). I then reached for a jacks pizza which costs 3.99 (and today 4 for 10) at target, and 5.99 here. That's twice as much for the same product that I can (and did) get down the street at target.

I confess that I ordered some pasta from the deli and began eating it while roaming the store to see what they carried and how it was laid out. It was my first visit. I was wrong in not paying for it first, but certainly had every intention of doing so. I simply had not eaten all day and the weight/price had been affixed to the container. It must be frustrating to observe this, knowing that some customers don't follow through with payment. However, his approach to me was unnecessarily rude and alienating. I cannot imagine that anyone working for this man would ever consider that a friendly, service-oriented approach was valued.

As I was sitting a bitchy bridal party walked in... The bride was a huge bitch! She was complaining that all of the bridesmaids weren't sitting together. When the front desk lady apologized the bride was still being bitchy. The front desk was not at fault! The only reason that the bridesmaids weren't sitting together is because one little princess showed up 13 minutes after everyone else was already seated and other customers had come in. Yet the front desk lady handled it with ease and was still very polite after all the bitchiness from the bride. The customer sitting next to the bride even got up and moved in the middle of her pedicure to accommodate the late princess. I would've told them to go screw themselves but that's just me.I can't say enough good things about this place... I highly recommend Polish and Pour!

The massage was done with her wearing latex gloves, so it was extremely uncomfortable for me and really did more harm than good in relaxing me, and the latex pulled on my skin. And the polish was messy - got all over my cuticles since they weren't pushed back properly. Three days later and my nails are chipped all over - I could have done a better manicure myself.My mom, on the other hand, got some genius nail technician and her manicure looked like it was done with lasered perfection - even, beautiful red coats, cuticles that were all but naturally missing and smooth.

She said that booking my group was a mistake and that she doubted they could accommodate that many people on a Saturday, but that she would call me back in a few minutes.

She did not offer us cups while we waited, did not ask us to choose our colors... \u00a0We waited for about 10-15 mins before anyone came over to us. And then still without explanation they took 4 of the 10 people back for pedis. We then had to ask 3 times for our mimosas and they weren't sure which champagne was ours as their were other groups there. The rest of the group was left standing at the front wondering what to do. It was awkward. Then while I was getting my nails done, the girl at the front kept coming up to me and asking who was getting what services. She literally asked me at least 5 times. Each time I answered her. I don't understand why she had to keep asking me the same question while I was trying to relax rather than just asking the girls standing at the front waiting. And I wanted to pay for myself and another girl, but that was too confusing for the girl to understand and resulted in a lot of painful questions. It was so ridiculous the nail technician was rolling her eyes and laughing. I should say the nail technician did a wonderful job which is the only reason there are 2 stars instead of 1.

Competing with others like the rooftops at the Wit or Dana hotels, the Ivy's Sky Terrace has positioned itself as an ultra-premium lounge with cocktail prices ranging from $12-$16 and a large portion of the drink menu dedicated to bottle service options upwards of $350.Even if words like \"new\", \"ultra\", and \"premium\" tickle your fancy, the Sky Terrace will disappoint with its lack of substance.

As far as drinks go, you might be disappointed to find that the $14 strawberry mojito we ordered was simultaneously cloyingly sweet and watered down, with very little mint and a lot of strawberry-flavored syrup. Most of the drinks we ordered off the cocktail menu were similarly sweet and lacking in alcoholic punch.

It's clean but the first women's stall has a huge gap between it and the wall so it might be awkward if people walk into the restroom and the first thing they see is that gap.Staff is nice but line formation for placing orders is rather confusing as patrons don't seem to stand in any line in front of the open register.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not sexist, but when it comes to my nails, I'd rather have a younger woman with perfect nails as my manicurist vs. an old man with jagged, long nails and dry hands. Relaxing Friday night manicure? Not so much.He was very nice and attempted conversation, but I was anxious about the manicure the ENTIRE time. He picked too much at my cuticles (I actually said \"ouch!\" at one point) and did not file as thoroughly as he should have. I also asked for a paraffin wax, but the owner explained they no longer used it, and suggested I do a sea salt scrub instead. For only $5 extra I went for it. Bad idea. The man rubbed it way too hard on my hands - it wasn't relaxing at all! Totally not worth it.Once the nails were prepped, he began the polishing...ACK!!!!! He got through one coat of one hand and it was awful. Crooked, streaky.....just bad. I decided to let him keep going as I figured he would fix it...but he stopped midway, and asked the next technician over if she could finish my nails. He was \"too nervous\" about messing up and wanted \"a pro\" to finish it for me. I thought he WAS a pro????So the new technician finished my nails - she did a good job, but was super rushed and the second coat was sloppy. She also used her nail to wipe up excess and dug in pretty hard into the cuticles. There was no room at the dryer so I had to sit at the station with a mini fan.I may be too picky, but this was not my idea of a relaxing manicure.

It's truly a beautifully set restaurant, with many large windows to view the outside restaurants, and passerby street people. Chicago is still awake, which is notably pointed out, with the busy bustling young adults who are outside deciding in large noisy groups, with loud voices saying things like... 'The night is young, lets go to this so and so bar!' ... 'I'm buzzed, and I want to check out this so and so lounge, and dance!'... Ji-Seung and I are like... 'dude keep it down, we are tired and just want some good food, because we're exhausted!'Anywho... our server, was a bit zippy from the get go. It was apparently very obvious he wanted us to eat super quick and get out super pronto, so that he could do his nightly errands, and just get to his next destination... after all, it's party harty day, and his job is the last place he wants to be.We start off with our choices: Ji-Seung chooses the app, which is a cheese wrapped rice ball, with a great dip sauce of tomatoes and herbs. It was so good. Crunchy on the outside, and as you bite into the ball, it sort of crumbles and falls into the rice inside. Not salty at all. I did mention: 'NO ADDED SALT TO ANY OF OUR DISHES PLEASE... thank you so much', with a small smile... hopefully he'll cheer up.I ask him: 'Is the margarhetta pizza less cheesy than the mushroom pizza?'... I ask because it's pretty late, and I don't want to go to sleep having to digest so much fatty cheese... already the cheese ball is enough.He ensures me that the first choice has less cheese, it just has mozzarella balls here and there. Okay, so I say that I want the less cheese Margarhetta pizza, with no salt. It's made to order, so a simple very easy request. Just don't look at that salt shaker and move her booty up and down, dosing the gluten free pizza crust, because after all the tomato sauce is salty as is.So what comes to the table?

So I'm eating slowly, because I won;t rush myself, and endure a night of rumblings in my tummy for any server and employees, because like them, if you don't care about my needs, why should I care about your selfish needs? After all, i didn't complain about the MANY mistakes you selfishly made because YOU WEREN'T LISTENING.The table next to us are a loud group of drunkards, who are taking their time enjoying their food.

Also we were hungry and tired... so maybe that just increased the taste buds to be less picky, and just love whatever is savored within our mouths. The crust is thin... but salty. The egg on top was the a very smart add on. It decreased the SALT VOLUME. The mushrooms are healthy, delicious, and I'm a lover of most shrooms.

I told her I wanted a 5 guard clipper on the sides and back with it tapered to a 3.5 guard on the bottom. She started using a 2.5 guard clipper and even though I wasn't facing the mirror, I could see how much hair was coming off. I immediately voiced my concerns but she told me it would look good. Nothing she did ever made it look good. She wanted to use a 6 guard on the top but I told her boldly that I wanted a scissor cut on top with only a little bit (maybe a quarter of an inch) taken off. She ended up taking a full inch off the top because she couldn't get it even and kept cutting. At this point I was disgusted. I should've voiced my opinion when I checked out but I just wanted to leave because I was so mad. I've never had someone cut my hair and not listen to what I wanted. I even told her I had a cut just 3 weeks ago so not much needed to be taken off. After using a barber shop in Lincoln Park for 2 years, I might be going back after this.

Emily, our server, was attentive without being overbearing and gave us great drink & food suggestions. This was my friend's second visit and even though she was getting an entr\u00e9e, she absolutely raved about the Wrightwood Salad. We got that, and the Spaetzle Mac & Cheese, to start. Both were excellent. I'm a Southern gal (born & raised in Memphis & moved to Chicago from Atlanta in April), and I like to think of myself as a Mac & Cheese connoisseur. The Windsor's did not disappoint. Creamy without being gooey and flavorful without being too rich. I decided to splurge and got the prime rib as my entr\u00e9e. It was served with mashed potatoes and I got an additional side of asparagus - I needed something green to balance my dinner! The prime rib was flavorful, tender, and cooked perfectly, and the potatoes and asparagus were both delicious. My friend got the bucatini, which she said was fantastic. At this point, we were very happily stuffed, but how could we have this amazing meal without enjoying a dessert as the finale? We decided on the nutella brownie, served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top. YUM. YUM. YUM. It was the perfect ending to a pretty perfect meal.Beyond the food, the actual restaurant is gorgeous, with detailed wood ceilings and a couple of rooms that look like they can be closed off for private events. It's beautiful without being stuffy, and when the weather is nice, the restaurant flows onto the patio thanks to what look like big pocket doors. We happened to chat a bit with the couple sitting at a highboy next to us (in what I think would have been inside the restaurant if the pocket doors were closed), and they raved about their food as well - she said the mussels were the best she'd ever had.Since going to The Windsor, I haven't stopped talking about it.

I went to him back in 2001, or so, when I was researching plastic surgeons to help augment my chin. I had an implant put in in 1996, which was causing bone degradation. Thus, I wanted it removed. Geldner is not a bone specialist--so i went to mckay mckinnon--who solved that issue for me. However, to work with the new chin (elongated very symmetrically), I wanted to add a more square jaw line. Speaking with me over the different options, Geldner proposed a new, \"cool,\" method -- buccal fat transfer from the abdominal area to the jaw line. Anyways I was convinced--it was less expensive than having implants put in, and he assured me it would look great. Well, needless to say, I had it done, and my face looked like an exact box. A square box. OR a chipmunk. After 1 year or so, I went back to him, and asked him to remove it. He charged me only $1000 for the removal, warning me, \"next time, be careful what you wish for...you might just get it.\" so he removed it -- but he couldnt remove it all, due to tissue scarring, etc. So my \"lumps\" are a little lopsided--and of couse, my skin is massively stretched. It was horrible judgment on his part to propose building a robert redford type of jaw line by using this technique. I sent his office a \"before and after\" and of course, got no reply. How can this guy be so revered? If you read his website, and his fans, you would think he was the holy grail. I went to several other surgeons to fix his mess, after he removed the buccal fat, and they mocked him. Professional jealousy? I cannot say.I am not a litigious person, but this was a horrible lapse of judgment. They had no digital imaging, so I couldnt see what it would have looked like before. My disappointment, and anger, more than anything else lies in the realm of bad judgment and of course--I cannot revert to where I was prior to the procedure.Be careful with teh surgeons, people.

I would say if you scout out the area of trusted offices their prices are no different. Apart from Lynn, I made an appointment with Dr. Geldner for a rhinoplasty consultation. This is where I am not a fan. I made the appointment weeks in advance and when I showed up, I waited in the room for nearly a half an hour. It's a doctors office so this is expected, but 30 minutes is time wasted. When Dr. Geldner came in, he barely said anything other than shooing off all of my two seconds of saying why I was there and referred me to an Otolaryngologist to whom he partners with when or if you mention anything involving medical concerns.

After getting the runaround from the Geldner Center for 2 months (I can't even count the number of times someone there told me \"Oh, it's all going to be fixed and your account will be credited tomorrow!\"), I have come to the conclusion that they are not going to do anything. It's up to me to dispute this with the surgical center, even though the Geldner Center was the one who gave me the written quote for surgery charges.

It can be even more difficult to walk into a plastic surgeons office that can help you explore areas that you could improve about yourself. ::Drum Roll:: But at Dr. Geldner's office, you will find a very different plastic surgeon. I met with Dr. Geldner for an initial consultation. I can only think of 3 words to best describe him: Ethical.Honest.Kind. After speaking with Dr. Geldner, he told me that there was nothing esthetically displeasing about my face. Nothing that needed correction, significant improvement, etc. This isn't what I expected to hear. I thought that I would hear \"sure we can do that...and make it look like this, and sure, I will do that too.\" Dr. Geldner takes his approach to plastic surgery with humility and honesty. So, in truth, what I thought I wanted to change, needed to change, hoped to change....was clearly just my vanity. Not seeing what I already had was exactly what I already needed. Maybe for some women, this is a \"duh\" or \"obvious\" afterthought. For me, I was caught up in ways to improve myself to something \"ideal.\" A huge thanks to Dr. Geldner in helping point out that all I need was a little more self-esteem.

So, in truth, what I thought I wanted to change, needed to change, hoped to change....was clearly just my vanity. Not seeing what I already had was exactly what I already needed. Maybe for some women, this is a \"duh\" or \"obvious\" afterthought.

The first time I visited this pharmacy, I was told it'd be about a 25 minute wait. An hour later, in pain, I finally had my prescription.Yesterday, my doctor prescribed a wound solution that again is not often in stock, but the nurse said she'd call it there because they might have it. Upon arrival, I checked in and explained that I'm sure it wasn't ready yet, but it had been called in and I wanted to make sure they have it in stock. I was assured they had it in stock and it'd be ready in about 25 minutes.15 minutes later, my name still wasn't showing up on the screen. I went up to check to make sure I'd been processed, and with no explanation, was just told \"we're working on it.\" 20 minutes after that, they called me.

We'll order it.\"I left and left a message for the nurse to see if she could call around and find it at a pharmacy near me. She called me back and said they didn't have it anywhere near me, but she talked to the Walgreens at Northwestern and they had a different solution that was fine for me to use, and they'd have it for me in the morning.So this morning I trekked to this Walgreens and received an attitude when I smiled, said good morning and said I was there to pick up a prescription. \"WE DON'T HAVE EITHER.\" I calmly explained what the nurse had told me. \"Yeah, no, we don't have either solution and it might be in the shipment we received this morning and it might not be, but no one can check until at least 2 p.m.\" All with a nasty tone.Talked to my nurse, who talked to them and confirmed 4 times that it will be available for me later this afternoon and I'll be alerted when it's ready.

I've only ever been to Zodiac room but not downtown so it was nice to experience this for a Sunday brunch with my mom. We did some shopping downstairs and decided to go have some tasty lunch since we were too tired to walk anywhere far. We got a nice table by the window and ordered away. The place is a more modern twist to the traditional Zodiac Room but it went well with the Michigan Avenue store. Okay, so let's talk about those popovers, I swear those things alone deserve five stars, they are to die for, and seriously the best part of eating at Neimans. Oh and that strawberry butter that goes along so wonderfully with them, I mean wow! How can I fail to mention the little chicken broth soup that I have with the popover, it is so very tasty and now that fall is on our way, it's the perfect thing to have on a chill, crisp day. I take that back, it's good anytime of year. We ordered the salmon platter as an appetizer which had a fabulous presentation but we could have passed since our entrees were enough. My mom ordered the thai scallops which she seemed to really enjoy. I wanted to get the turkey panini but then when I saw a cheeseburger brought out for someone else with gorgeous skinny frites, I quickly changed my order and got the burger. I asked for well done and it was over done so that's the reason I didn't give them 5 stars. I wasn't in a hoity toity mood to send it back but for a $17 burger which can easily be shared by the way, I want it done right. The service I must say overall was very good, our server was sweet and attentive and everything was brought out as it should be brought out. For drinks my mom got the strawberry margarita and I got the fruity sangria and both were also delicious. As if we weren't full enough, because I seriously should have been done with my broth and popover but nope, we had to try one of their desserts. We shared the creme brulee and it was beautifully presented but I didn't love it, it was a little warm like it was sitting out for a while and the flavor just wasn't like it is at RL or some other places.

Keep reading to find out why i had the most amazing, comforting and helpful experience. This couldn't have been a better place to go and receive help, specifically from Dr. Norman Blase. I was driving home from college and was having trouble closing my eye and my vision was getting blurry in one eye. I freaked out because i was having trouble seeing and going out of town the following day. I called over to Dr. Norman Blase's office and he instructed that i come by immediately to get checked. When i got to his office i was helped immediately. He was extremely professional and comforting at the same time which made me feel relaxed about the whole eye examination. He ended up finding out that my cornea was scratched and gave me 2 eye drops. The following morning i woke up feeling like a new person with ZERO pain in my eye. I would HIGHLY recommend people to Dr. Norman Blase for various reasons. First he was extremely thorough in his examination as well as making sure his hands were clean before touching my eye. Second, he was comforting and made sure during the whole examination that i was okay and also would stop when my eye began to tear up. Third, he genuinely cares for his patients and that's why he instructed that i come in to see him immediately. You would be silly not to go and see him, he is the BEST!!!!", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 5, 28]}, "19": {"description": "I went to the Pearle Vision on Division in the Gold Coast.

The best part, my teeth did come out MUCH whiter (she said 2 shades) so I was happy! The only reason I am leaving off a star is because the first 5-10 of the procedure hurt very badly. Felt like needles going into my gums. She asked if I was comfortable and said tingling was good, burning was not. It felt like a little of both so I said I was fine (I didn't want to be a giant baby!). When she removed the mouth piece my lower and some of my back gums had turned white. She said this happens sometimes and they would go back to normal in a couple of days. The whiteness is gone but my gums are a little scabbed up and open sore looking. I've been using lots of mouthwash to make sure they don't get infected and they seem to be healing quickly. I looked online and this happens sometimes when the peroxide gets on your gums. Apparently its not supposed to happen but it's not that big of a deal when it does. I think it's partly my fault for not telling her I could feel some burning/tingling on my gums. I'm just glad it is my lower gums and back teeth so you can't see it when i smile! Overall I will be back in a few months for another treatment as it works great.

The bar at Markethouse has not caught up to the innovative locovore movement of the kitchen. I even glanced over the beer list and saw no craft beers - just macrobrews that you would expect to find in any gas station, apartment fridge, or concert across the United States.The food was good. Between the two of us we had the chicken pot pie and ribs. The pot pie was delicious and perfectly sufficient as a meal of its own. The crust was philo dough and overlapped the edge of the bowl. Tucked inside were large chunks of vegetables and chicken - well portioned if not a tad salty. The glory of the ribs was in the sauce and fries. The large slab was cleverly placed on top of the bed of fries so that some of the barbecue sauce dripped down upon them. We didn't even touch the coleslaw.Our concluding opinion of Markethouse was that it was a good restaurant for two dollar sign comfort food. Other menu items included hamburgers and fish and chips.

I called Rosin to make an appt and see if they would give me a pair to hold me over until my visit.

I had one appointment that was uneventful, got some glasses for computer eye strain, and then as my vision worsened I had two more appointments with a doctor who was terrible. The front desk staff was very nice and the opticians who helped me select/prepared my glasses were very sweet and helpful, so that's why they get two stars instead of a lowly one...The problem is with the optometrist I saw for my second two appointments. I cannot recall his name, but he was younger with dark hair. Everything with the first exam went fine, but he gave me no instructions on how to wear my glasses, nor did he mention they should be for distance only, nor did he bother updating my prescription for computer glasses to treat my eye strain from my job even though he asked about my work and how often I went on computers. I left under the impression that I had one pair of glasses to wear all the time, which was wrong.The second appointment I had, about 9-12 months later, I had the same doctor, and he laughed at me once he found out I had been wearing my glasses wrong. He couldn't keep a straight face the whole appointment, including when he informed me that 'you've actually, hah, made your vision worse by wearing those glasses when you work on the computer, heh.' I asked him about contact lenses and he laughed at me again and told me 'actually, hah, I want you in bifocals.' He couldn't say bifocals without chuckling, as though they were the ugliest glasses in the world. Then he informed me not to be upset and that people get Lasik just to see as well as I see so I shouldn't be upset. Well, it's not about what you want for me, Doctor, and it's your responsibility to tell your patients how to use the glasses you prescribe, without laughing at them. \u00a0I work as a graphic designer and now my eyesight is permanently worse: my eyes are my profession and I clearly trusted the wrong person with their care.I have since taken my business to Chicago Vision Club, and they're amazing (I'll be reviewing them next to make up for this nasty review). They told me that had I been prescribed proper glasses for computer use and given detailed instructions by my optometrist at Rosin, I could have prevented a lot of damage.

The eye exam portion with the doctor was fine. I asked the staff to assist me in finding a frame, and I was told \"go ahead and pick some out\" without any sort of help at all. When I finally picked out a pair, waiting for them to ring up my glasses purchase took over an hour because there was one guy who appeared to kinda know what he was doing. I sat and waited for SO LONG that a manager finally took notice and came up to me and asked me why I was still waiting. I said \"I don't know\" and she had one of the (several) front desk people assist me. Thing is - that lady didn't know what she was doing and told me she'd have to wait for the guy to help. So basically, I sat across the desk from her in total silence for an additional 15 minutes while I waited for him to finish up someone else's order.They then went on to use the excuse that my insurance was \"unknown\" and therefore takes significantly longer to complete the transaction. Really? EyeMed is an unknown insurance? Because I'm pretty sure that nothing should ever take that long to ring up EVER no matter what the excuse. And guess what? I don't care. If you don't know my insurance, or if it's too difficult to help people who have my insurance, then don't accept appointments from people with that insurance. So two weeks later, I went over to pick up my glasses and apparently they don't do any sort of adjustment or checking of the frames other than to look at them on your face and say \"yep, look straight!\" They don't check fit behind your ears, the width of your face, nothing. When I asked them about whether there's an adjustment to make sure they fit my head properly I was told \"we do an adjustment when they come in to make sure they're level on the table and the arms touch the table equally top and bottom.\"..........seriously?!?!That would be FANTASTIC if every head was completely symetrical and level like a table. .... which they NEVER ARE.I just took my glasses and left rather than have them sit there and look at me with the look of pure attitude and confusion. Once I was back in my office I followed up with a call to the store manager.

I really recommend talking with Brad (office manager) if you think there is an issue. I had very good experiences here and (as most people do) got very upset when I had one frustrating moment of mis-information. I have a very weak prescription and I ended up getting the priciest (biotrue) contacts. I expected quality and they were horrible. They sent me home with a few pairs and they were ripping in my eyes and unbearable to wear for 8 hours. I am not qualified to say this but I think since my prescription is so weak that the contact material is too thin. When I went to pick my order up they mentioned that they were very highly rated and the trials were probably bad. This seemed reasonable to me because I have had something like this happen with a bad batch of contacts before and I also couldn't expect the front desk person to know what was wrong with them and I had to go.I kept having the problems and I decided to go through my 6-month supply, which took me close to a year because I don't wear them often. I mostly wore my glasses or would only wear them to the gym for a couple of hours. I figured I had to pay out of pocket on top of insurance so I'd try to use them as much as possible. Most of them ripped or chunks came off the edges before I even put them in.I called in because I was finally out of them. My insurance doesn't renew until 8/30 and I just wanted to order some contacts to get me through next month and a half and I obviously didn't want these contacts. When I called in to get just any other dailies that they have... I was told that they couldn't switch brands so close to the end of my insurance. I wasn't given an alternative on the phone and I didn't ask more, I just got mad.Long story short(er)... Brad reached out to me and cleared everything up. I am going to get a brand that I had prior to these until I come in for my yearly appointment and look into Lasik. I'm glad that everything has been worked out.

We went there for a friend's birthday who is very into farm-to-table restaurants. When we got there, we ordered cocktails.

We had to ask for things multiple times because the waiter would forget to bring someone's drink or appetizer. The food came out and my sandwich was great (I had the pulled pork). I was a little bummed because the mac and cheese never mentioned that it had mustard on top - that kind of ruined it for me.

From day one, the Catering Manager, Bruce, was a joy to work with. He responded promptly to emails and phone calls, reiterated everything in writing that we spoke about by phone, and did everything he could to accommodate our hyper-specific requests calmly, like they weren't strange or high maintenance. He was also extremely organized, and quick to make suggestions when we brainstormed about the menu and presentation. Shortly after exchanging a few emails, Bruce invited us to have lunch with he and the chef, Isaac, to discuss the event. Not only did we come up with a menu that met our needs, but they agreed to accommodate our request of sourcing bread and pasta from two additional, out-of-state vendors, and serving the home brew my husband makes, worked with us to identify and order the specific, deli-style packaging we wanted, and allowed us to provide labels we designed to apply to the containers.The day before the event, I went to the restaurant to drop off the sourced bread, pasta, and food labels (which a handful of kind staff people offered to carry in for me), and Isaac invited me to the kitchen to taste some of the ingredients that would be used in the food for our party. It was really rewarding to see how many items were from local sources, and the quality was evident in the flavors I was able to sample. It was also a wonderful opportunity to see how much care was going into our event, and how passionate Isaac is about what he does.On the day of the party, the catering team did a fantastic job of setting up the buffet (of sandwiches, salads and chips), walking our guests through making their selections, and clearing everything out before the end of the evening. Both Bruce and Isaac took the time to stop by the venue to make sure everything was to our liking. We were also able to tip the staff by phone a few days after the party, instead of having to deal with doling out cash after our reception, when we were frazzled with getting everything out of the venue in time.The food was exceptional. From the bottled sodas created in-house, to the three flavors of handmade potato chips, to the roast beef made on the premises specifically for our sandwiches, everything was delicious, and very much enjoyed by our guests.We're so very grateful for the time, effort and attention to detail that Isaac, Bruce, and their team were able to provide.

Now let's get into my grievances with this spot:We opted for this place today after learning they had a Restaurant Week Lunch Menu. For $22, the selection was pretty bleak. My butternut squash soup was good and portabella mushroom sandwich was tasty (goat cheese made it flavorful, otherwise it would've just been \"meh\"). Service was so ridiculously slow-- we were sitting around idly for 40 minutes during our lunch hour, waiting for the third course. I had selected an Apple Fritter but asked for it to be packed. When I opened it up to eat just now, it looked half eaten. Regardless of whether or not it was, the portion size was meager, at best. Really lame deal for $22.Especially upset by our experience here today because one of my friends is gluten-free, and she had specified her restriction to the waiter upon ordering. Lo and behold, her plate came out with potatoes touching her omelette (potatoes shouldn't have even been on the plate, it's all gluten!).

The fruit was super fresh and delicious; berries were ripe and pineapple was sweet. It was a great combination of summer fruit. The bread was warm and chewy, and the outer crust was perfect. The inside was light and airy. This meal, for being so simple, was literally the best thing I have eaten since arriving in Chicagoland!The interior of the restaurant is rustic. There are wooden tables and chairs and hardwood floor. It is keenly decorated to look like the inside of a modern farm house and the art is very outdoorsy.

I seriously have not had better service than with Eye Society. An avid eyewear devotee, everything from vintage to modern frames pieces I will invest some serious cash in.This last Saturday, visited with my friend who I had referred to Eye Society, and as per usual, they were warm, welcoming, fun; the atmosphere was totally laid back. \u00a0Eye Society has been the only optometrist office since I started seriously collecting frames that hasn't been off-putting when I enter the establishment. Frames are not something easy: first impressions and presentation are absolutely pivotal, and as an individual, you often need time to try on many different sets to find \"the one.\" Eye Society never rushes your time with them, and they let you be so you can concentrate on what your are fitting to your face. I had sent an email earlier saying that I was popping in, and without much of a queue, Becca, one of the opticians with ES, said, \"Hi Kayla!\" right when I walked in and gave me a quick hug. When was the last time you were hugged or addressed by name without a patient sheet on a clipboard at the Optometrists office?The ambiance of ES is quite nice- laid back, comfortable, and with a definably stylish interior, it feels more like a boutique where you are a regular than an optometrists office. Also, the lighting is not harsh-- so you can really see what a frame will look like without the glare of standard in-store lighting.You will shell out money here- ES does an excellent job finding discounts where they can with insurance, promotions, etc., but with premium frames and lenses comes a premium price. A great piece of advice given to me a few years ago: \"Sometimes the best isn't for everyone.\" Eye Society is very much in this category. If you are looking for run of the mill, standard frames, with as small of a price tag as possible- ES isn't for you. IMO, if you are going to an Optometrist office in Gold Coast, common sense should tell you a premium pair of designer lenses isn't going to be \"free\" with insurance. If you are looking for \"free,\" visit a location with lower-end options and a more traditional feel.The pair I picked up on Saturday (without an appointment) are perfect. Very chic; very me. Also paid out-of-pocket for the frames, without an insurance benefit.Hopefully to you, the reader, this speaks volumes for itself: a pair of frames without insurance, inclusive of premium lenses and coatings, went into the higher three figures.Just remember to have fun, and that eyewear isn't something you can put a price on: you wear it most days, and is an outer expression of yourself. The investment is worth it.(Previous review:)Just loved this place- the selection of frames is great, the service was exceptional; I am an eye wear aficionado, and the fact that they said I could bring in my other vintage frames to be filled speaks volumes.Will be a patient and customer for however long my future is in Chicago- they've got me for life.", "rating": "5", "date": [2012, 8, 6]}, "50": {"description": "I am new to Chicago and was very nervous to find a new eye doctor.

I only own my own business and therefor understand the necessity to offer my customers the goods I advertise), but none of the staff seems to care.2) the staff hates making food.

They advertise free wifi and they provide the password displayed prominently. My girlfriend had no issues whatsoever getting onto the wifi, so I figured I would be fine. Wrong.

The extra pita is definitely a must when trying out these dips! I ordered the mixed kebabs which were actually pretty good. I was a little disappointed by the rice - not as much flavor as I would have liked but that may have been the goal so it didn't overpower the meat.The atmosphere - super small and cozy place. They keep the lights pretty low which adds to the cozy and intimate atmosphere. There are some neat booths along the side that give you some privacy.

Fresh, flavorful, full of finely diced tomatoes that give it a slightly acidic kick that I find tabouleh which is primarily chopped parsley lacks. The red cabbage is lemony and delicious-- this coming from someone who usually doesn't order cold dishes.

In the evening rush hour, the city was bustling, and we crossed over the Chicago River and enjoyed the street musicians and the varied architecture. The Chicago Tribune Building, with all its intricate designs, diagonally across from the steel and glass Trump building, were quite a juxtaposition. I can now see why the City of Chicago wants Trump to remove his ugly name from his otherwise attractive building!Anyway, the restaurant was indeed cozy and fairly romantic, with candles on every table, and little booths in rounded alcoves. We were seated in one of these alcoves, and though it was certainly sweet and romantic, the seat was uncomfortable--the width of the rounded bench and the distance from it to the table was not quite right for either of us, and we are average-sized people. Oh well. The waiter was friendly and very attentive. We got great service. The food was so-so. I had the vegetarian mezza platter. The baba was nothing to write home about, the hummus unremarkable, the tabouli very good. The pita was warm and fairly fresh, but it didn't appear to have been made in-house. My husband had the vegetable kebab over basmati rice. He said it was OK. I had some of his, and it was good, but again, not remarkable. \u00a0I'm glad that we said YES to dessert--We had pistachio baklava. Oh my goodness, this was delicious.

In addition, the place was pretty empty when we got there. The emptiness probably had to do with the location (a little hard to find - especially being out of towners) and the weather (it was raining that night so most people probably chose not to go out).The food - really good actually! I was super impressed by the appetizers. I love a good hummus and tzatki. We ordered a couple samplers and the server made sure to bring us extra pita which was great. The extra pita is definitely a must when trying out these dips! I ordered the mixed kebabs which were actually pretty good. I was a little disappointed by the rice - not as much flavor as I would have liked but that may have been the goal so it didn't overpower the meat.The atmosphere - super small and cozy place. They keep the lights pretty low which adds to the cozy and intimate atmosphere. There are some neat booths along the side that give you some privacy. We were at a large table in the middle so it wasn't quite as intimate but it could be fun for a date night.The service - this is where they lost me. Our server wasn't that great. If the place had been super busy I would have understood her forgetting things or taking awhile to bring something but the place was almost empty. She forgot one of my co-workers drinks and so he was sitting without for a bit. In addition, she just seem kind of irritated with us the whole time and I'm not sure why.

We were looking to share a few small plates, have a glass of wine, and move onto a late night bar. When we arrived, we were surprised that nobody was there to greet us. There were a bunch of waiters and bus boys walking around cleaning up and nobody looked up at us. After about 5 minutes of waiting, one waiter finally decided to walk towards us and ask if we needed help. We asked if the kitchen was still open for a quick bite as the restaurant was still scheduled to be open for another hour. He responded yes and said we can sit where ever we pleased. There were only 3 tables occupied at the time so we chose a table by the window. It took another 3 minutes to receive the menu. I quickly ordered a glass of red wine and my girlfriend just wanted water. After a brief glance we decided on 2 tapas and paella. The waiter said they were all out and the kitchen was no longer cooking anything new for the night. If we wanted food, they would be able to reheat some leftover food from the day and he explained which dishes were left. I was turned off by this. If the kitchen was closed, we should have been notified prior to being seated. We were hungry at this point so we just ordered one dish to be \"reheated\". It came out like warm and overly spicy. After a few bites, I chugged my wine just so we could escape this dinner nightmare. Completely spoiled our evening.

It was escargot in top of toasted bread and topped with a cream sauce. The dish is promising however, the ratio of the bread and cream sauce to escargot was a little overpowering. I wanted the flavor of the escargot and garlic \u00a0to shine a little more.Overall the meal was good. Compared to other tapas places I would say this place is average.

I love the idea of being able to eat smaller portions of more dishes. On a typical visit, you should get about 2-3 small plates per person. A few favorites- the garlic potato salad is a must have, as long as your date agrees to eat it with you (or doesn't mind extreme garlic breath). The tuna canoli also from the cold tapas is absolutely delicious. From the hot tapas, the Bacon wrapped dates are the perfect combination of savory and sweet, but let them cool before digging in, they're super hot! Grilled shrimp, grilled calamari, and the chicken brochette are also fantastic. If you like octopus, go for the Grilled Octopus under the specials, absolutely delightful- crispy grilled octopus that melts in your mouth. The red sangria is also fantastic, get the pitcher.

But outside it's very Spanish. A nice restaurant and wine bar, offering different varieties of cold and hot tapas and paellas. In their specials they have grilled Octopus, it's amazing. Spanish people know how to cook octopus right. Calmares were a little bit rubbery and oily. Tortilla a la espanola, pan con tomate, jamon serrano, queso de cabra, ensalada catalana, gambas al ajillo - the menu is all in Spanish and sounds so native. But underneath you'll find the translation and the explanation in details of all the dishes of course. On weekends they have special offer for paellas: if you order one (they have four different suggestions: mixed, seafood, vegetarian and chicken with vegetables ), you'll get a free bottle of wine. But some people might think that the wine they give for free (it's two options of white and two for red to choose from) isn't good enough for them and would want to order something more extravagant and fancy.All wines here, except of one which is Malbec from Argentina, are from Spain. A decent selection for reasonable price, interesting choice of cava. For desserts: profiteroles, strawberries with ice cream, fresh Peach casserole under streusel topping with ice cream etc. The Peach casserole was a ok. I have some doubts that the peaches were fresh, looked like canned to me. But still, pretty delicious. And they offer a variety of dessert wines by the way.

We started off the meal with Calamari. It was good, but tasted like calamari I've had a million times before. Next we had the Bruschetta (Tomato & Basil, Mushroom & Parmesan, Buffalo Ricotta & Tuscan Honey). The Tomato & Basil was just OK and the Mushroom & Parmesan was LOADED with so many mushrooms I think the parmesan decided to stay in the kitchen. I swear if there was parmesan on those slices of bread than the waiter must have eaten it off before he got to our table. Now the Buffalo Ricotta & Tuscan Honey was pretty amazing. It was so good I wanted to lick the little bit of buffalo ricotta that got on my fingers, but since I was in direct eye site of the maitre d' I decided against doing it.For our entrees we had the Spaghetti AOP and the Vitello Scallopine. The spaghetti was...well spaghetti. The most exciting thing about this dish was that it came with a huge red pepper in the center of it. I dared my friend to take a bite of it, but she elected not to (I think she was trying to be all fancy and highfalutin). The Vitello Scallopine was veal medallions with a tablespoon of mashed potatoes and teaspoon of spinach. I was disappointed by the portion size and by the taste.

Employees call it \"the cafeteria\" and it looks exactly like a cafeteria. This cafeteria, The Allspice Cafe, is extraordinarily good, and offers a wide variety of food, all at prices that are reasonable, although they are not cheap.The cafeteria is broken down into multiple sections. There is a section which displays and serves dinners. Patrons line up there for salmon, chicken, mac and cheese, eggplant, and the like. Usually there are two or three entrees, vegetables and starches available. Another section makes hamburgers and the like, to order. There is a nice section that does nothing but offer two entrees, plus various vegetable and starch dishes, all of which are nutritious and calorie counted for the customer. Here is an example of a meal from this station: baked fish, choice of couscous or bulgar salad, choice of two vegetables from: spinach, asparagus, mediterranean salad (like a horiatiki), squash. Calories = 600, according to the chalkboard, and price = $6.95.Another section makes sushi, to order if you like, but mostly to stock a chiller with boxes of sushi. The sushi is not particularly cheap, nor is it great, but it is made fresh.There is a frozen yogurt bar, almost like a frozen yogurt store, where a worker will put together your yogurt to order.Some items in the Allspice Cafe/cafeteria are quite a good deal. The meal that I described above is one such deal. Most hot dinners, for example salmon, mac and cheese and one vegetable, would also run about $7.00. The hot dinners are quite good.There is also a salad bar that charges by weight.I recommend the Allspice Cafe, particularly at lunchtime when all of the stations are open.

But 30 minutes earlier she had been apologizing for all her mistakes.

There was a massive, neon-colored dj booth that played some techno music, and it felt very authentic to a Japanese karaoke bar.But....We were bummed to find out that it was private rooms only. For me, the whole point of karaoke is to watch strangers embarrass themselves, and perhaps help you drive up the courage to embarrass yourself.Regardless, we had a round of drinks there and my pear sake martini was good, but I was pretty amazed to find that when my sister ordered a Makers and Diet Coke, the waitress literally brought them separately. She also forgot my boyfriends single shot of Jameson on the rocks.

Because there were 5 of us, the minimum of 5 cocktails had to be purchased to meet their minimum requirements for the karaoke room. We didn't want individual cocktails so we decided on purchasing sake bottles. Each bottle were considered as two cocktails.

So we asked her to give us less than 5 minutes so we can figure out what to purchase instead of holding up her time. This rude little Asian lady told us well if I leave this room I will be starting your time! (With her angry face) are you serious lady?!!! Maybe if you gave us a heads up of which sake's were out, it wouldn't have taken so long! We ended up purchasing two of the same bottle of sake and a cocktail. Aggravated by our server, we had a hard time understanding how to read the karaoke machine. Everything on the machine as well as the remote were in KOREAN. When the rude server came back with our cocktails, we asked her how to use it. Our server said she doesn't know to use the machine. We asked if anyone else here knows to use it. She said no.

I always wonder what good therapists are doing at Massage Envy, since I have a vague inkling that they are seriously underpaid compared to other spas. My only issues were that she was pretty talkative, and at first I responded out of habit and politeness, but eventually just zoned out. I really don't like it when therapists talk but I find the awkwardness of being blunt and telling them not to talk more uncomfortable than just dealing with it. The thing that really surprised me was that she asked me how I got my scars, which i found to be shockingly rude and made me feel pretty uncomfortable. Even when I go to those ghetto Asian places and they don't know I speak chinese and talk about me behind my back, no one brings it up. Maybe people are just more open here. Also, I think they read the reviews here because when she walked in, she announced the start time and end time out loud, which is pretty cool because I've gotten robbed of several minutes at other locations a few times. The room was also super warm and the bed was REALLY warm so I think they fixed the cold room problem.I tipped her $21. I literally cannot believe people writing that they feel it's okay to tip $10 - I hope it's because they don't know any better and not because they're ignorant. [uh oh, I feel the rant starting...] If you just used your brain for one second and think about what's going on here - you're getting a dirt cheap massage. The company keeps a lot of the money, and the therapist is making barely anything. Then you are adding further insult to injury by leaving them coffee money instead of a real tip. For someone to say \"if you want me to tip $20, charge me $100\" is idiotic. Really, is that what they have to do, charge you more money, for you to give a fair tip to your masseuse? Every time I go, I always overhear someone leaving like an $11 tip or a $10 tip and acting like they're all generous and I always want to just smack them. A lot of the people here do just as good a job, if not better, than the masseuses at other spas and tip should service. Tipping based on price is just a starting point. If you can't afford to properly tip [or you don't want to], don't get a massage.

No other local burrito place has that kind of flavor and quality for that low of a price (~$6)!

Disclaimer: I don't eat really meat/chicken at these places so I can't compare those types of options.Chipotle: always \u00a0delicious but no shrimp/flavor like this!

Ordinarily I was a spectator on Yelp just surfing places to go. But I feel I needed to write this to forewarn people before they go to this place. Many Chicagoans and foreigners might like the food but what they are liking is the idea of Indian food which in it's essence is spectacular. However the execution of the idea by this restaurant has been appalling. If this food was an ambassador of India then people out here have been fed lies since it's inception. We tried 3 appetizers and one dessert. Let me begin with the Paneer Tikka (Cottage cheese). We paid $18 for something that tasted like an eraser, we could have got a cheaper one at staples. Paneer is supposed to be soft and melt in your mouth. The Chandni Chowk Aloo Tikki sounds and looks great in theory however in practice it was a mash of bullshit. The pattie was terrible and lazily prepared. The samosas were mediocre at best, however no where close to how it is supposed to be. I forgot about the poppadum, it was not fully cooked and had corners which were raw not roasted. However the cook was more generous with the Gulab Jamun (dessert.) Probably too generous because he burnt the dish. And the server had the audacity to bring the burnt dish to our table and \u00a0 place it there in a nonchalant manner.The service was alright.

He really did try to fix things, bless his heart. He sent the delivery woman back to my hotel and I met her downstairs after getting out of my pj's for the second time (I guess I could have gone Walmart style and worn them downstairs). This time she brought a napkin, a plate, and a fork. She was very kind and apologetic. I thanked her and asked to forward my thanks to the manager as well.

I'm kinda disappointed for not finding kheer and mango ice cream for desserts which are offered at Gaylord on oak street. The lunch buffet is around $15-ish/person.

This wouldn't be a problem if the managers were actually professional and could follow through on calling disgruntled customers in a timely fashion. As I stated earlier there is no main office which means there is no number for you to get in contact with and since employees are under strict rules not to give out managers' phone numbers or any number which can reach someone with one functional brain cell, your best bet is to just hope to walk in one day when the manager is working. The rules and restrictions put in place for membership holders are ridiculous for the amount of incompetency that happens in this establishment.

Pasta that is made in house, served al dente and which holds up to the sauce. I bought the small plate of pasta and it was still a big portion. The fonduta sauce was smooth and creamy and had just a hint of smokiness to it. The peas were firm to the bite. The flavors are well balanced. Plus,the staff is very attentive. Their wine list is long and thoughtful with wines to suit any taste. I also very much appreciated that, despite the marble floors and glass walls, the restaurant isn't overly loud. You can have a conversation in your normal speaking voice. I also liked the lighting, which is not quite mood lighting but is dimmed enough that the atmosphere is relaxing.

He looked confused and asked her what she wanted to do. She stated that she would like her dish removed from the bill and he agreed and offered to remake her dish to-go. We obviously had a bad experience, but at least they were trying to make it right. This is where it gets weird. Our waiter brings out my friends remade dish packed up in a take-out bag. Then a different waitress brings out the check (which I think was done on purpose) \u00a0and we notice that my friend's dish was not removed from the bill. We inform her politely, to please remove the item since she was not able to eat most of it. She agrees and then goes to talk to the other waiter about it. Two minutes later she comes to the table, says nothing and snatches the carry-out bag off the table and leaves!! We were shocked! We never asked to have her dish remade, the first waiter offered! We were going to say something, but figured what is the point....if their kitchen sends out food with staples and crap in it, why trust that they won't do it again?! I can only imagine what other health codes they break. We just paid the bill and left.

If I hadn't jumped on a bus on Ohio last week I would have never known that Dao was this close to me. There are other fast food chains and wine bars along this street as well. Just steps away from Michigan Avenue too. On a Tuesday night, Dao was not even busy. I was immediately seated.Decor - subtle yet immaculate. I love the statues and figurines and the bamboo. The interior is dimly lit, which sets a more intimate atmosphere. I love the middle section. The cushions are super plush, which makes for great, comfortable seating. Bathrooms were a bit wahwah but Its not like I was expecting it to be glammed out.Service - Quality service! Truly. The staff here are very welcoming and very warm spirited. All smiles and great talk. one of the elderly workers (probably the owner) even offered to teach me how to use chopsticks. Even though I already know how (I was just too hungry to play around with them), I thought that was cute. Drinks - There is a full bar here. Unless someone buys me drinks however, I choose not to imbibe. I pretty much always stick with water. If you read my other reviews, you will see that this is a recurring trend.Food - Let it be known that within 10 minutes of placing my order, I received my food. This scared me at first to be frank. I questioned the freshness of the food at that point.*Pad Khee Mao - I LOVE the squishy/chewy rice noodles. I told them to make sure it was spicy because I have been to many places that claim this dish is supposed to be spicy but it never is. Again, they said they would turn up the heat but I guess that meant for them, to add more thai chilis. It wasn't spicy at all, but it was tasty. I thought it was funny that this dish was supposed to come with chicken and shrimp. More like chicken and a shrimp. I swear on everything that of the entire dish, I had one piece of shrimp. I definitely would have preferred beef and if I try this dish again, I will make sure to get it with. Other than this minor let down, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.

If you are expecting a pampering experience, it is probably best to look elsewhere. Before coming here my only waxing alternatives were 1) storefront nail joints where the possibility of double dipping (horror) is top of mind or 2) higher end spas/salons where prima donna estheticians needlessly drag out what should be a wax-wax off process with their delusions of being Michelangelos, working in hot wax instead of paint. I point to one salon in particular on Rush Street, where the woman flat out refused to wax my brows, noting that I should let the hair grow more in the middle (aka unibrow style) before she would even touch them. Digressions aside, EWC gets the job done, with an easy to use online scheduler to make appointments.

Prior to finishing my beer, she asked if I wanted coffee, or dessert. I asked for a second beer, to which she replied, that she'd get it and bring the check also. Is there a limit on 2 beers or is it just this particular waitress that \u00a0decides on what quantity of beer a customer \u00a0can purchase before being made feel they are unwelcome.

Thankfully, we each ordered savory entrees, otherwise it would have been too sweet of a meal.For our cocktails, we both tried Tee Time, which was citrusy and refreshing. I don't normally go for cocktails, as I'm a beer girl, but I very much enjoyed this one. Because I love Chilaquiles, I had to try Level Two's version and I wasn't disappointed. The smoked chicken flavor came through and the refried black beans were a spicy and tasty addition. The tortilla chips also stayed crisp in the dish making for a hearty flavor and texture combination. I wish I hadn't talked as much as I did, so I could have eaten more of the dish before it got cold.The dessert then came around, and it was a tasting of three different treats: white chocolate bread pudding, key lime pie, and chocolate chip cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake best, as it was smooth and creamy. The key lime pie was tart, but too crumbly, and the white chocolate bread pudding was just okay, as it was a bit on the dry side.All in all, with pleasant service and an elegant atmosphere, Level Two offers a menu to satisfy any taste, and I was certainly not disappointed.", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 1, 18]}, "31": {"description": "Their weekend brunch is fantastic!

Eggs benedict, bacon/sausage, thinly sliced steak and potatoes, seafood patella, little cast-iron pots filled with sausage and peppers, granola, a meat/cheese section, and fruit/salad selections. There was also a omelet bar, a bread/bagel station, and a nice table of desserts. On top of all of this, there is a table where you can make your own bloody mary or mimosa. Lots of fresh juices, fruit purees, and all kind of bloody mary-ish options (olives, pickles, etc). Once you make your base, the server brings you your choice of booze (champagne or vodka). Service was excellent. Our server was Courtney, and she was friendly and attentive. Overall, the food was all fresh and tasty. I think the eggs benedict (served on top of an english muffin with ham) was my favorite (aside from the mimosas of course!).

In case you have less than six people, here are the things we got, in order of how much I liked them: 1. Loaded potato skins. Always the loaded potato skins, which I crave when I can't get, and which I have resorted to buying frozen from Costco in desperate times. These were crunchy, with generous amounts of cheese and an acceptable, if not as generous, sprinkling of fresh bacon. Definitely the favorite dish we got. 2. Bruschetta. One of the things we were on the fence about ordering, but it ended up being a fantastic choice (for those of us who liked tomatoes... so not me). It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty, and really refreshing, especially against the other, heavier things we ordered. 3. Mozzarella sticks. Arrived at the table at the perfect temperature - almost nothing more disgusting than lukewarm mozzarella sticks - and the perfect proportions of coating to cheese. 4. Boneless buffalo wings. I'm not a fan of boneless buffalo wings in general, but these were particularly one-dimensional and featured a very, very thick coating of batter with a small piece of meat. 5. Potstickers. Generic, definitely not something we would have ordered if we had had fewer people. The sauce was the only part of this appetizer that was interesting or different. Would not recommend. 6. Spinach dip. Definitely not worth ordering, it's a huge portion of spinach dip paired with a small serving of chips. The dip was bland and insufficiently creamy, with a weird, buttery aftertaste. Would not recommend. We also ordered a short glass of Angry Orchard and one of 312, both on tap. Our waitress initially brought us two glasses of Angry Orchard, but she was quick to correct her mistake once we pointed it out. Service overall, however, was lacking. I understand that, since the bill was so small, she wasn't anticipating much of a tip, but she dropped by our table to check on us only once, mumbling something that only one person heard, and we \u00a0only saw her three times more - twice when she asked if we wanted more food (yes), and once when we asked her for the check. Our food was brought out by other people, and she never actually brought us our check. At least ten minutes after we asked, another girl saw us waiting, asked if we needed our check, and brought it to us within minutes. I'm going to give this experience three stars because service was pretty much nonexistent and because of the wait times, which were far too long considering there weren't that many people in the restaurant.

Moses never explained the endless appetizer deal that wasn't on the menu when we asked about it. A friend at the table, who knew what the deal was, had to do his job and help the rest of us. Once we ordered, Moses only gave us three plates for our appetizers and never brought us napkins the entire time and never brought the rest of our plates. Two of use had to eat using the appetizer dishes.Also he only came to remove appetizer dishes once. So we had to start putting our empty drink glasses, empty appetizer plates on an empty table as he would bring a few more items on the half hour. We didn't have any more room at the table.My friend's were never able to get a refill on their pop in the entire three hours.I do not eat pork and would get sick if I did. I mentioned that I didn't eat pork when I was ordering my appetizer so he could tell me which ones had pork. I came to enjoy a Jack Daniels burger with no bacon/onion, an appetizer, and a dessert.

He gave drink recommendations and was just so pleasant. I'm a server so I think I pay extra close attention to the people who are my servers and he was just great!!! We had the spinach flatbread and garlic parm buffalo wings for an appetizer (1/2 price apps if you sit in the bar area). Both were great. Then we both got the ribeye with lobster tail and it was all delicious! So much food omg! We got the broccoli and the mashed potatoes for our sides. Get the mashed potatoes!!! You'll thank me. I don't even like mashed potatoes and these were awesome. For dessert we had the Oreo madness. So good!For drinks my boyfriend got a house Long Island iced tea and then a blackberry Long Island. I had the berry mojito (SOOO GOOD!!!) and the Barbados rum punch. That was good but I wanted something a little stronger. It took a while for us to get our drinks but whatever that can't be avoided sometimes. Everything was soooo good! Sometimes I feel like it can be a hit or a miss with chain restaurants. They tend to be very mediocre. Our experience tonight was just awesome. Oh I had left my wallet and Augusto ran out to our car to give it to me. I thought that was sooooo nice since I had no idea.

Steer clear of server Moses. Visited on December 6 with four friends for lunch. We traveled from Hyde Park to near north side, just for TGIFriday's. Our server Moses was terrible. He rarely came to our table which made a lunch, that should've been closer to an hour, stretch into three hours-mostly waiting for him to take our order. We sat dow at 3p and couldn't leave until 6:15p. We also had to track him down for the bill. Service: Moses would never come to our table, rather he would come in the vacinity and we had to actually call him over by name. Again, it was five of us. Moses never explained the endless appetizer deal that wasn't on the menu when we asked about it. A friend at the table, who knew what the deal was, had to do his job and help the rest of us. Once we ordered, Moses only gave us three plates for our appetizers and never brought us napkins the entire time and never brought the rest of our plates. Two of use had to eat using the appetizer dishes.Also he only came to remove appetizer dishes once. So we had to start putting our empty drink glasses, empty appetizer plates on an empty table as he would bring a few more items on the half hour. We didn't have any more room at the table.My friend's were never able to get a refill on their pop in the entire three hours.I do not eat pork and would get sick if I did. I mentioned that I didn't eat pork when I was ordering my appetizer so he could tell me which ones had pork. I came to enjoy a Jack Daniels burger with no bacon/onion, an appetizer, and a dessert. An hour after ordering, he shows up with a dbl cheese burger full of bacon and proceeds to argue that I ordered this bacon burger and tried to shove it in my face because he didn't want to admit he was wrong. Who does that? He took no responsibility, gave no apology, and his customer service skills were offensive. I unfortunately, had to cancel my order because I didn't have another hour to wait for him to get it wrong again and our friend's valet time was expiring after dealing with this nonsense. I spoke to manager, Johnny, who didn't introduce himself nor wear a nametag. We had to get his name from another employee. I informed him of how our service was not good and how I came to enjoy a JD burger and had a bacon burger shoved in my face and the server tell me it would be a \"long time\" before I get my correct order. The manager did not take responsibility nor ownership of his server's poor service, and gave no apology. All he said was, \"I don't think I can get your order out to you faster.\" I canceled my order and didn't order anything else. I expect better from TGI Friday's, especially since the manager claimed the Erie St location as the flagship. During our visit we also had to deal with gnats flying around. The \"loaded\" potato wedges were anything but and they looked and tasted like the restaurant ran out of the appropriate cheese and they substituted with an Aldi brand spray cheese.

My coworkers and I have been going here just about every week for the past few months because it is steps away from work and the lunch special. We only have a 45 minute lunch break so the location is very convenient. Over time we got used to the slow service and just dealt with it and were usually late getting back because we could not be served and eat in 40 minutes apparently. We would mostly order soup and salad, rarely entrees because of time constraints, and always sat at or by the bar. This particular time it was taking more time than usual to get our food after we ordered a little bit before 12:30. Lunch break ends at 1:00. We started paying our bill around 12:55 because we were trying to save time after we ate and not have to worry about it. Some people got to pay, some people didn't because the bartender walked away. At 1:00 we had to tell the kitchen staff, the bartender wasn't at the bar, to please just box up our food to go because we're already late. This was 5 lunch special orders, mix of soups and salads and 1 chicken tenders. This is Friday's, I don't think the chefs were growing their own lettuce back there or making the soup of the day specially for individuals. The place was not busy at all. It appeared that there was about one employee per every two customers there. People that sat at the bar after us received their food before us. At 1:05, the bartender gave us 2 large bags with our to go food, apologized to us, and we left. We were shocked that the manager didn't apologize, we were not offered anything, and since we all had already paid to save time there was no discount.When we all got back to the office to pass out our food, of course the chicken tenders were missing and a salad was missing. I called the manager and explained the situation and he kept referring to our pick up order. No, this was dine in. He proceeded to tell me that he has my food ready for pick up. \u00a0He refused to send somebody over to drop it off after I asked. I had to leave work again to pick it up, no apology, nothing.

Worst experience I've ever had at a Panera store, which I've always loved. I only frequent the Panera Cares in Lincoln Park now because of their mission and incredible service. To make a long story a little shorter, I went there one morning to work on a paper and bought a bagel and a small coffee. A man sitting two tables over had bought a small coffee. He exhibited signs of homelessness, but had made a purchase and was NOT bothering any customers, as only one other man was sitting near us. An hour and a half into a peaceful morning, 2 Chicago police officers came in and told this man to leave. He quietly asked why and did not understand as he had bought a coffee. The man was not disrespectful at all. Eventually 4 more policemen came in. Their reason for kicking him out was that \"I don't know, management just wants you out and that's what we're here for\" Considering what time the store opens, I spent a longer amount of time in the store than this man could have and bought only a bagel more. I somehow did not seem to warrant a police escort out. I restate, the man DID NOT cause any customers ANY problems at all. I sent an email to corporate about the shameful discrimination I saw. I didn't receive an answer until a month later when I resent the email and asked why I had not heard back. They answered the next day this time and forwarded it to the branch. Store manager Gina emailed me back saying this was not a normal occurrence but that this man had a history of problems with the store and had a heated discussion with a manager before sitting down. Apparently another manager called the police to have him escorted out as \"safety concerns were high.\" My next question to her was that why, since I came in the store I was sitting with a somehow dangerous man an hour and a half ago, a high safety risk man was allowed to sit near me for such a long period of time without having any manager come up to him or me about this. I waited 3 weeks for a response about this and sent another follow up asking about it. Her response was that \"the police took awhile to show up\"...an hour and a half? If he's poses a high safety concern, why wasn't I warned to not sit near him? A quick google search showed that police response times averaged 4 minutes in Chicago in 2011. While I would like to trust Gina that this man was escorted out in a highly shameful way for my safety, I find it hard to believe when it takes them an hour and half to do so. How this situation was handled is shameful, and the manager did not EVER come up to me to tell me about this situation that was apparently high risk OR ask the man to leave himself - both me and this other customer were unaware of the situation until 6 Chicago police turned up out of the blue, which to me is a complete disregard for ALL customers involved, including this homeless man who was so dangerous he walked out without ever raising his voice or getting belligerent. This situation was NOT handled in ANY way that showed this branch cared about their customers. Gina mentioned she was glad I did not see this exchange between the man and the manager, but if this was a high safety risk situation, I would absolutely hope that the manager of a store I am patronizing would be filling me in on any safety concerns, not leaving me in the dark until 6 policemen show up out of the blue. The manager should have told me, or should have had the decency to ask this man to leave instead of surprising him with and embarrassing and DEFINITELY unnecessary police escort. For this reason I will never return to this branch.

Following the unfortunate incident I experienced last night, Amanda did everything she could to remedy the situation and sincerely apologize. She assured me that she had no knowledge of the construction workers plan to work through the night, and that it won't happen again. She was professional and kind and incredibly generous in compensating for this incident. When the construction continued through the following night, she was kind and thoughtful enough to put me up in a hotel for the remainder of the week. Her actions in this situation prove me wrong in my initial impression of the values that back Bandera. This seems like an incredible restaurant under great ownership. If the customer service is anything like Amanda's, I recommend you all to check out Bandera. Previous review:Unfortunately, Bandera is my neighbour. My review speaks to the character, integrity and basic human values of the Bandera ownership. Bandera shares a building with a residential condominium, and to avoid doing their kitchen renovations during business hours, or to maximize their time for renovations, Bandera is inconsiderate enough to be BREAKING CONCRETE, hammering and redoing floors and ceilings in the middle of the night. I will be going to work on 3 hours of sleep because of this. They have no regard for the law as this is not legal, and police complaints were made tonight.

I believe the ribs exceeded the chicken in tenderness and flavor, while the coleslaw was delicious without being overwhelming.

The live jazz is just the right volume, giving the place a supper club feel.The menu is similar to Hillstone's and Houston's, which isn't surprising since it's affiliated. A couple of our favorite starters from there appear here. The spinach artichoke dip is creamy, and served with sturdy tortilla chips perfect for dipping. Also included are sour cream and a salsa with just a hint of heat. House smoked salmon is very smokey, delicate and flaky, served with crisp toast and a mayo and dill based spread.Bandera's Caesar salad isn't for purists, as it uses kale, and the croutons are made from a fairly sweet corn bread. Ours were heavily over-dressed, but when the waitress noticed we weren't enjoying them she immediately had them remade with about one fifth the dressing, and they were much better.A house specialty is the enchilada, which is available with steak or a la carte. It's a bit unusual in that it's stuffed with squash, but is quite creamy, cheesy and satisfying.Much of the menu is given over to burgers and other sandwiches, so the price for dinner and a show can be quite reasonable.

The most important aspect was how amazing she found them when she received them. She was showing me some unrelated pictures on her smart phone when I noticed she had taken 5 or 6 different pictures of her flowers. In her words, she was stunned and overwhelmed at how pretty they were and how great they smelled. She wanted to capture the moment with pictures. Lastly, I won't list when my special request was because I don't want them to be burdened with similar requests, but I did ask for some special consideration when I called in the 2nd order.

The restaurant is new, modern, and clean.Cons, 2 issues:1. I've eaten at different Cosi's prior to this one opening, and I love the chicken pesto sandwich. I order it pretty much every time. One time, when I ordered from this restaurant, I got a hot/toasted version of the same sandwich, except replace lettuce with what seemed like a half pound of melted cheese. Disgusting, horrible tasting sandwich, not one which I ordered before. I went online to further examine the menu, and i see there is a Pesto Chicken Sandwich (cold, with lettuce, yummy!)

It's so frustrating to be so clear in ordering something so good, but you can count on them messing up each time. Even when I take my sandwich to the cashier to pay and they ask what I ordered, I tell them, and the register says \"melt\".

He told me they were out of wheat but then a stack of wheat flat breads arrived so I informed him, wheat please. It was given to me on white, but no biggie. the chicken was chicken - big chunks. Same with the avocado, big chunks. This was great because the interior of the sandwich was way more than the flat bread holding it together. Typically when this happens, the bread gets destroyed. However, not here. The flat bread was toasted to perfection to hold all the interior in without breaking apart.The bacon, however, was disappointing. It wasn't crisp and really thin.

It's served with rice as a perfect accompaniment. This dish has been their special on Thursdays for as long as I can remember, and this past summer, on my family's way back from Navy Pier, I led them here. My husband looked at the outside, and knowing my taste, really wasn't expecting much. My daughter was just hungry, and when they both looked at the huge board that's the menu, they were both happy.They still had the Greek chicken! I ordered it, while my husband and daughter ordered a Chicago-style hot dog and a philly cheese steak, and they were both dipping into my plate!

Go if you love to BBQ and when you want a leisurely night.We had to laugh a bit because there is a sign warning you of the hot grill and to keep your babies off the table...and we still managed to singe our fingers. It was well worth it because it was really an engaging dinner. They kind of trick you because as you are grilling your own dinner, you realize YOU are doing the cooking. Well, that's the fun. Make sure you put the timer on your phone to help you remember to turn the meat, even a couple minutes can quickly pass you by and burn your food. The service is great. They replace the grill grate frequently and add oil so you get the perfect grill each time. We got one of the combos for 2 and it was plenty, almost too much (really it was for a famished couple who haven't eaten all day or a party of 3).Great location downtown, so if you are in the area for a conference, just want a fun dining experience, or want to get your grill on, reserve your spot here!", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 16]}, "28": {"description": "The selection of food here is decent.

I arrived a bit early with a friend so we had to wait at the bar. Our bartender was fantastic. He suggested a sparkling sake...it was their special for the day or something (It was called Banzai Bunny and was sweeter to taste than most alcohol). He told us everything from the history and origin of sake, the makers of the one we ordered and was very hospitable in general. We were seated in a cosy booth in the top floor and ordered the \"Samurai for 2\". Do note that the lighting is dim on this floor, so ask to be seated downstairs if you don't like that. But it does make for a warm, romantic vibe if you want that. If this is your first time at a Japanese BBQ, they give you instructions on how to make your meal so now worries! My favourite part of this meal was that they served us in perfect intervals - I didn't have to wait too long or rush on anything. Even if you're not an avid beef eater (like me), don't let it hold you back cause its marinated and well done here. Don't leave the meat a few seconds more than their suggested time because it toughens the meat. Don't go to this place for a solo meal or in a group larger than 4-6 people. Get the Green Tea Mille Crepe for dessert for sure if you like Matcha, its great. Get the Bibimbap instead of the noodles. If you get separate plates of meat to grill, avoid chicken because it doesn't grill well and was honestly the worst part of my meal. If you get a set, don't order separate plates to grill until mid-meal or after the set is over because for most, it should be enough. Also, they have valet parking and if you're staying there past 10pm (when their valet closes), there's always parking space on the other side of the street!

Gyu was like a combination of a Korean BBQ house and a Japanese izakaya. They pretty much took elements from two of my favorite types of restaurants so I was super excited to try it. I'm usually a value guy and aim to get my money's worth when it comes to Korean BBQ. Pretty much every good AYCE kBBQ restaurant I've been to has been some sort of no frills joint with non-English menus, and my sole purpose in life was to cram as much meat into my stomach until I could barely breathe. While that still sounds like a great meal, Gyu Kaku offers a different type of experience that balances good food but also a fun environment.Reservations: It didn't start out too well because if you try to reserve a table for more than 10 people, they pretty much force you to get one of their group packages. It didn't make sense for us though because there were various dietary restrictions within my group, and it would've been way easier to just order everything a la carte. That, and we didn't wanna waste any of our appetite on crap filler items like seaweed soups and salads. To be honest they were pretty inflexible about making substitutions and made planning this dinner way too difficult. They pretty much forced me to break my group into 2 separate tables and then told us they can't even try to get the two tables on the same floor. Ambiance: They had trendy decor that you'd find in a lot of these more modern Japanese restaurants. The first floor had a mix of booths and regular tables. The second floor had more regular tables and also a bar, and the third floor had traditional style seating where you take your shoes off and sit at a lowered table. It was pretty cool. They had cushioned seats without legs that you just pull up to the table and then underneath the table the floor sunk down a step for your legs to hang down. Seemed great for larger parties. Drinks: Who says you shouldn't mix beer and liquor? Oh the sake bombs were flowing all night long. They had a pretty decent drink deal for bigger groups (or a small group of alcoholics) that included 3 pitchers of Kirin and two 750 ml bottles of sake for a hundred bucks. Food: So the first thought that came to mind when I saw their menu was that it wasn't all you can eat and I would probably spend a ton and still leave here hungry. While it's definitely more expensive than a more traditional Korean BBQ place, it wasn't too far off from what you'd expect in river north and surprisingly our group of big eaters left feeling pretty stuffed.It was a bad idea allowing the guys with the biggest appetites to order for the table. The menu suggested you order 1-2 appetizers, 2-3 meats, and 1-2 side dishes per person, so I rounded up in every category and estimated that we would need 7 dishes per person. Based on that, we didn't think it was a big deal ordering 45 items for our table of 6 haha. Garlic rice - Definitely has enough flavor to stand on its own. I probably consumed a whole bulb of garlic with all the rice I ate. \u00a0Miso chili wings - Typical sweet/spicy Asian spinBacon chips - Deep fried pieces of bacon that you garnish with rock salt. What kind of evil genius thinks of this? So deliciousFried dumplings - A little bit crispier than normal pan fried gyoza, but the filling is pretty similar. Wasabi crunchy shrimp - Tempura style battered shrimp with a creamy wasabi sauce drizzled on top. Garlic noodles- Super thick noodles that weren't too saucy. Reminded me of Filipino pancit canton. Spicy kalbi ramen - I'm a huge ramen fan but I just wasn't really feelin this. I'm not too big on beef based broths and the flavor just seemed a little off to me. Noodles were meh.Grilled meats - It's tough to describe the differences between each of meats, so let's just say everything was DAMN delicious. Seriously how can you not love marinated meats freshly grilled right in front of you. The best was when a nice char started to form on the outside. We pretty much ordered a little bit of everything. Harami skirt steak - Unique miso marinade. Cooks pretty fastKalbi short rib - The quintessential kBBQ meat. You can never go wrong.Chicken/shrimp/salmon - Nothing too unique about these. Still delicious though.Pork belly - These took a little longer to cook, but nothing beats the flavor of charred pork fat.Toro beef - It's described as beef bacon, so you gotta get itRib eye/filet mignon - Thicker cuts of meat. Came out super juicyOverall, I would say dinner was pretty fantastic, and I would definitely come back despite the whole reservation fiasco. Maybe it's the sake bombs talking but everything was perfect.

West Egg feels like a small-town diner, imported into a big-city location. And when it's early in the morning, that's just what the doctor ordered. When you enter the building, you might be a little concerned depending on what door you walk through. They're going through construction right now so one of the entrances seems like it's a for-sale property, still undergoing renovations(much like the rest of Chicago). Once you make it inside though you'll be pleasantly surprised to see quaint tables, friendly waitresses, and an unmistakable smell of eggs, pancakes and everything else breakfast.The menu is fairly normal size for a diner, featuring a wide variety of different pancakes, waffles, omelets, and other breakfast specials(many with, but also many without, egg). I got the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy, which came with home-fried potatoes, a sausage link, and two eggs cooked to my specifications. My friends got two omelets, and a California crepe(sort of like a very thin rolled omelet, but filled with avocado and other vegetables and topped with alfalfa sprouts). The food itself was all good, though the omelets seemed a little more dense and less fluffy than I usually prefer. The biscuits were flavorful, though they could have been fluffier. Quite enjoyed the sausage gravy, wish they could have spooned a little more of it on. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the homefries were crispy as well.

West Egg feels like a small-town diner, imported into a big-city location. And when it's early in the morning, that's just what the doctor ordered. When you enter the building, you might be a little concerned depending on what door you walk through. They're going through construction right now so one of the entrances seems like it's a for-sale property, still undergoing renovations(much like the rest of Chicago). Once you make it inside though you'll be pleasantly surprised to see quaint tables, friendly waitresses, and an unmistakable smell of eggs, pancakes and everything else breakfast.The menu is fairly normal size for a diner, featuring a wide variety of different pancakes, waffles, omelets, and other breakfast specials(many with, but also many without, egg). I got the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy, which came with home-fried potatoes, a sausage link, and two eggs cooked to my specifications. My friends got two omelets, and a California crepe(sort of like a very thin rolled omelet, but filled with avocado and other vegetables and topped with alfalfa sprouts). The food itself was all good, though the omelets seemed a little more dense and less fluffy than I usually prefer. The biscuits were flavorful, though they could have been fluffier. Quite enjoyed the sausage gravy, wish they could have spooned a little more of it on. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the homefries were crispy as well. Granted, I was not wowed by West Egg, but I would come back here again.

The broth was a bit oilier than I typically prefer, potentially because the spice agents they use here are more oil based. We also got the chicken karaage, which was good.Atmosphere: The dining area is much bigger than Mt. Prospect, which means the wait was significantly less. It feels less like sitting at your grandma's house and more like a regular restaurant.Waitstaff: Friendly, nothing out of the ordinary.Overall: I enjoyed this location and still think it's the best ramen I've found downtown.

Yes, the prices are higher than they are in Mount Prospect, but that's expected because of the location and high rent costs.I've been to the Mt. Prospect location twice, the first time was the best experience food-wise. The cha-su pork was grilled to perfection. Since then, and both times at the Chicago location, the cha-su is ok, but not great.

This broth was suppose to be from their Silver Dish menu where the broth was to be \"fruity and natural\". It was totally \"full bodied\" from their Gold Dish menu side. The waitress says all their soup bases come already pre-mixed with the MSG so my face puffed up looked the moon later in the evening. Their dishes could use some bok choy, scallions, parsley, or some other greenery to add some color and fiber to their all brown dishes. I ordered the Silver Dish Hokkaido-Chasu with egg. The pork was fatty and the ground pork was very salty. My husband ordered the Silver Dish regular ramen with a fried shrimp. The dish was salty as well. Don't get me wrong, I love salt but these dishes were over loaded. What a pity as I was looking forward to getting my weekly ramen fix conveniently down the street.

To compensate, our very nice server asked us if they could provide us with something else and my friend asked for a chicken karaage replacement. The server also brought out 2 new chashu porks for them to try and see if it would taste better: and yes, it did! When it came time to pay, we discovered that the \"compensation\" Chicken karaage was actually charged and that it actually wasn't offered as a replacement. We then had to discuss with the manager to settle on charging them for regular ramen without Chashu and additionally adding on the chicken karaage price. I really don't see why they couldn't have just not charged us for the chicken. Oh well. They ended up losing money this way.

Though if you're on vacay like I was, it's worth a try.", "rating": "4", "date": [2016, 1, 12]}, "6": {"description": "My wife and I got the Deep Dish Nachos appetizer ($11) and Jalape\u00f1o Blue deep dish pizza ($25). \u00a0The nachos can only be described as holy cheese! \u00a0Very cheesy, super tasty. \u00a0The presentation wasn't all that fancy, but who cares about that? \u00a0This isn't an upscale place, the atmosphere is very laid back and down to earth and the taste of the pizza is MIND BLOWING! \u00a0My only regret is that I won't be able to sample the whole menu since I'm only in town a couple of days.Now I'm not going to lie to you, if you're looking for some great pizza quick you will not find it here. \u00a0The deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes to cook and they are well worth the wait time. \u00a0So grab some friends, grab some drinks and relax and make conversation for a bit. \u00a0Overall we were there for about an hour and 15 minutes give or take.And as a side note, the beer is pretty tasty too. \u00a0Prices are reasonable for draght (20oz for $8) and they've got a good selection of local brews for anyone from out of town looking to sample the Chicago fare.And side side note, they also do a military discount. \u00a0I can't complain!", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 18]}, "22": {"description": "Good pizza; however not the best in Chicago. I would highly recommend Giordano's is located across the street. Crust is better I think; however Giordano's has a much better sauce which, for me, is why I think it is better.

Since the pizzas we're going to take a long time we ordered fried artichoke hearts and artichoke dips. Both delicious.
