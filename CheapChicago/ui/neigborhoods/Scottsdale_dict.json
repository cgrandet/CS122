Amazing enough that I decided to fill out this form and add the recently opened store to Yelp. Don't want to read the details? Skip to the summary and head to Sleepy's!!I moved to Chicago from California with an apartment lined up, but no furniture. I figured the RoomPlace / the MattressPlace on Cicero would be a great option to get \u00a0a mattress quickly as they were advertising a sale, The place was clean and had a nice set-up, but the salesmen were aggressive and oozed shady. They refused to negotiate until they realized that though I flew in that morning, I wasn't born that morning. When they provided me with their 'best' price, I told them I would check out the surrounding shops to compare. The cocky salesman informed me that I would be back. The other shops I tried on Cicero aren't worth mentioning. They simply lacked quality. Then I stumbled into Sleepy's as a last resort before heading back to the shady salesman at the RoomPlace. Paul greeted me at the door and was professional yet personable. He was a true gentleman and gave honest feedback on the pros and cons of each mattress. I was thoroughly impressed with his knowledge. As opposed to trying to wheel and deal he simply let the facts speak for themselves. I found a mattress I liked and wanted to compare it to the one down the block at the RoomPlace. Paul understood me wanting a peace of mind and off I went to sit on the other bed. The shady salesman was quite smug and hovered as I sat on the bed trying to get a feel. I noticed that their pillow top bottomed out and my decision was made. I went back to Sleepy's where I received better service & a higher quality. Paul quickly checked me out and the delivery was accurate and smooth for an amazing price!Summary: Mistake = going to the RoomPlace / the MattressPlace.

The food has always been awesome and the prices can not be beat. The Good: The food. I love the Carne Asada dinner (which is on special on Saturdays). I could eat it once a week. The rice and beans are also very good. My wife loves the Taco Salad, which she substitutes the rice for meat. The soup they provide for you at no cost is also very good. The prices are very good as well. These days it is close to impossible to get a good diner for 2 for under 20$ and this place breaks that rule. The Bad: No liquor license.

Have a quarter ready because you need to put one in the shopping cart. Don't worry, you get your quarter back once you return your cart. Genius isn't it? People want to get their quarter back which eliminates the need for and employee to gather carts and helps keep prices low. You might find yourself walking up to the register and find no one there. Don't worry, the cashier will come around in a minute or two. Aldi pays they employees very well, but has them do multiple jobs. When the cashier has no one in line, they sneak off for a few minutes to straighten up the store and restock items.Also, either bring your own recyclable bag or \u00a0you can buy a bag at the register for a mere .10. You will also bag your own groceries, there is no bagger. Love that they encourage people to bring in their own bags, another smart way they cut down on overhead and keep prices low!This is a great place to come for toys as well, the selection may not be huge but you can find some incredible deals.
