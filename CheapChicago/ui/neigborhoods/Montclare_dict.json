I've also visited the other locations but less frequently. What can I say, I'm not really impressed. Everything sold there is imported from Poland but looks made in China. The store itself tries to look like a WorldMarket kind of place. For those of you who have visited Poland in the recent years, most products look like those found in the Polish equivalent of a Dollar Store (ex Wszystko Za 5zl), except way more overpriced. But if you're looking for a cheap ethnic gift, like mugs or shot glasses, you'll find something. I've usually only visited around holidays, like Christmas or Easter. i love colorful ornaments and of course, I stop by when I see them in the displays. Most Christmas ornaments are the typical Old World glass ornaments. However, they are super expensive. So are the Easter decorations. Honestly, very similar ornaments, also all handmade from Poland, are sold at Shon n' Save during the holidays, all for way way less, most at $5 each. Rolling pins and cake pans? I can get those at Home Goods and pay half the price. The glass vases they have? They're pretty and unique but alas, Home Goods always has a display of the same ones from Poland, for a fraction of the cost. This all pretty to look at, giving the store 3 stars. I took away the one star for my recent experience though. I stopped by the Christmas Market at the Daly Plaza during my work break, only because it wasn't very busy. I was surprised to see that Dom, itp had a booth, all filled with ornaments. They were all so ridiculously expensive (a tiny ornament for $34.99) but I guess I should've expected that, given the prices at all the other booths. There was only one more person \u00a0at the booth browsing with me. The three girls working the booth, all Polish ladies in their 20s, were basically ignoring us. That's fine with me though, I don't like to be bothered by sales people while browsing anyways. However, they were having a rather loud conversation, in Polish, in which every other word was profanity. They probably assumed their customers didn't speak the language or just plain didn't care. I honestly didn't know so much vulgarity can be put in one sentence, by women so young, as they didn't look much younger than myself. That alone made me walk away, and to my surprise, two booths down was another ethnic Polish booth, where I bought some beautiful porcelain to give as a gift.

There is a big wall of coffee mugs - can you find your name in Polish? \u00a0I found mine pretty fast, Aniela. \u00a0The designs on the mugs are limited with either delicate flowers or white and red flags bearing the giant eagle. \u00a0I went with the flowers. \u00a0I was so excited to find my name, as my mom recently told me that a long ago member of our family was named \"Aniela,\" so I thought it was cool that I have the same name. \u00a0The mugs are only $5!I didn't browse the pots and pans or other kitchenware - those are the same in any language. \u00a0There are some pretty accessories, but they're a little more expensive than I was willing to spend. \u00a0Same goes for the clothes - I was kind of feeling a black tunic with leather pockets, but for $125 I wasn't even going to waste my time looking for my size.The girls behind the counter speak Polish on auto-pilot because most of their clientele speaks Polish. \u00a0I often forget that, outside of the suburbs, European cultures still live in tiny enclaves in Chicago. \u00a0The girl finally realized that I don't speak Polish when she handed me my change and I replied, \"Thank you.\" \u00a0She was unnecessarily apologetic for speaking to me in Polish, because I expected that she would.The parking situation is nice, there's a small parking lot, although mostly occupied by people shopping at the grocery store next door. \u00a0We were able to find a spot right on Belmont though.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 11, 17]}, "5": {"description": "As a cook, my favorite stores are the small, out of the way places that stock esoteric and strange kitchen objects.

I had a total of 4 fittings with Adela, and after that I just had to take the dress even though it was not done. I asked her 3 times to make me a V-neck, in the front and the back (previously a boat neck). She cut me some kind of odd shape with three corners, and each time I asked her to fix it, she said she would and then didn't. She always managed to make things too tight or not tight enough, so the dress never actually fit me around the bust and shoulders. When taking up the skirt we ended up with a crooked hem line. The worst part is that she is just a sloppy seamstress. Here I had a gorgeous designer gown that has now been totally butchered by her attempts to alter it. As a result I now have to buy a new dress for my wedding and say goodbye to all that money I spend on the dress and the poor alterations.

I mean a lot of work. Kelly, the owner, recommend Adele, who does dress alterations out of her house. Adele removed the shoulder pads, inserted cups, lowered the neck line, took the sleeves out, and that was all good. I would only recommend her for simple alterations though. She is not very attentive to detail of the dress, did not do a good job taking in the back, and would not remember what I wanted to be altered in the dress.

I purchased a vintage bridal gown from this shop. The dress had amazing beading and lace. The color was worn out, it had shoulder pads, it needed to be pressed, among other things, but I loved & saw the potential of the dress. I fell in love with a gown that needed a lot of work! I mean a lot of work. Kelly, the owner, recommend Adele, who does dress alterations out of her house. Adele removed the shoulder pads, inserted cups, lowered the neck line, took the sleeves out, and that was all good. I would only recommend her for simple alterations though. She is not very attentive to detail of the dress, did not do a good job taking in the back, and would not remember what I wanted to be altered in the dress. I would not recommend her for the more complex alterations & I would not say that her work is quality. Additionally, she is not very professional when it comes to sticking to appointments. There were times when I waited outside her house for 15+ sometimes 30 minutes. I ended up taking it to another alterations shop, so that another lady can finish making the rest of the alterations. \u00a0I ended up paying more for alterations combined than the dress itself. Advice: Check out this place, but if you do fall in love with a retro gown, take into consideration the cost of rejuvenating the dress.. I am with my second alterations person with more than 3+ fittings and its costing me as much as I paid for the dress.

She does a great job and will work with you on whatever you want to alter on your dress; add or take away sleeves/trains/etc at a reasonable cost.

I would highly warn anyone who would try and sell a gown or veil to the questionable owner, Kelly Hamilton. I brought my dress and veil in one year ago and had to call Kelly to get updates on the selling status. Whenever I would call, we would be disconnected. I usually could not get through for a day or so and then would be told that there were new phones with problems. I believe Kelly had my number logged because whenever I called from a different phone, she would answer. The contract agreement stated that when the garment was sold, a check would be sent in the mail. After many calls, Kelly finally admitted that the veil was sold even though I had not received a check. \u00a0After several more calls, Kelly finally sent me a check. Then six months went by and I never heard from her, so I called again only to experience the disconnections. Kelly then told me that she did not know if my dress sold and that she couldn't tell because I didn't have a picture of it. Even though I gave her the invoice number, she said it was impossible to look up and that she would call me the next day to update the sales status. She never called and one week later I called her from another phone. There was no problem with disconnection. She then told me she FORGOT to check on my dress and if I come in, she would look for it. Again, I asked her why she couldn't give me the status over the phone. She would not answer my question but said that if I come in we can look for it. I made an appointment and she had cash in an envelope for me. I asked her about my dress. She said she still didn't know if it sold, so \u00a0I asked her WHY she was giving me money. Instead of giving me an answer, Kelly asked me if I wanted the dress back. I took the cash and left NEVER wanting to deal with her again. Her actions speak volumes regarding her honesty.

It's a 24/7 gym2. Unlike many gyms, Xsport gyms (at least the newer locations, not the former world gym ones) are large, and have lots of specialized machines and weights. \u00a0So, if you're serious about weight training, bodybuilding, and/or serious hard-core cardio, they have lots of specialized equipment, which you won't find in places like Cardinal Fitness or Planet Fitness (which are geared more towards your average fitness) or even many Bally's locations (which are stuck in the 80s). \u00a0Xsport has pretty much EVERYTHING.3. It's relatively cheap (except for some select locations like Lakeview). \u00a0Xsport stripped most of the unnecessary crap that you'll find at places like Lifetime (racquetball, spa, seating areas, and all that yuppy crap that drive up the price of a gym membership). \u00a0Of course, Xsport, *does* have some unecessary crap (sauna, jacuzzi, etc), but it's minimal.So, Xsport is a great chain, definitely consider it.HOWEVER,The Bricktown location specifically is G-H-E-T-T-O. \u00a0I'll repeat G-H-E-T-T-O. \u00a0It's probably an inside joke within the company that this is the worst location of all their gyms.The equipment is not well-maintained at this location. About a month ago, I witnessed a guy -who was doing seated cable rows- ...the cable snapped, and he fell backwards. \u00a0He was lucky not to hit his head on anything.A very large percentage of the members at this location are lazy, rude slobs. \u00a0It starts in the parking lot, where people follow you in their cars to park as close to the entrance as possible. \u00a0Even though they're coming to the gym to WORK OUT they don't want to walk more than 30 feet. \u00a0(Of course, it gets VERY crowded and busy during that one day of the month when they hold \"Membership Appreciation Day\" and give out free pizza and cake....sad). \u00a0And because they're too lazy to walk, many perfectly-able people park their cars in handicapped spots (and they do NOT have a handicap sign on their car), or they make up a parking space where there isn't one.Inside the gym, rarely do people re-rack their weights. \u00a0And I don't mind if people don't remove the plates they used from the machine they used, but it DOES bother me that they just leave plates on the floor, for someone to trip over. \u00a0People also don't re-rack dumbbells, which is even more annoying.For dumbbells, there's only 2 pairs of every weight-category in the gym, and when you need to use the dumbbells in the 5-45 lb range (the most commonly used), they're often NOT to be found on the weight racks. \u00a0People (and women are just as guilty as men) take dumbbells far from the weight racks, and just dump them wherever when they're done using them. \u00a0Which means, when you need to use a dumbbell in the 5-45 lb range, there's a good chance you'll waste 10-20 minutes looking for them.Oh, sometimes you won't even find the specific dumbbell you're looking for, because people steal them. \u00a0Yes, an employee confirmed it for me. \u00a0And the same goes for D-handles, which have a high turnover rate of disappearing. \u00a0Of course, when you DO find what you need, there's a chance someone may have stuck their chewing gum onto it.Of course, people don't only steal the gym's belongings. \u00a0They can also steal yours. \u00a0I stopped using the lockers in the locker room when someone picked my lock and stole my credit cards. \u00a0I've also had a jacket stolen, and personal equipment stolen (ab hangers, bar pad)...so make sure not to forget anything behind when you move from one equipment to another, because it'll be gone in ten minutes, and don't bring your wallet with you.Which all makes sense why the company puts little investment into this gym. \u00a0Why they don't maintain the equipment, why they don't frequently fill the paper-towel dispensers, why a faucet in the bathroom may be \"out of order\" for weeks at a time...I mean when people steal from the gym, or when they leave the faucet ON with the water running after they're done washing their hands in the bathroom (IF they bother to wash their hands)...it's just not worth putting too much investment into this location, otherwise the company loses money on this location.So, like I said, great chain, crappy location, \u00a0I've been to other locations, and they're very nice. \u00a0Unfortunately, I have no choice, as there is no other gym near me that has all the equipment I need. \u00a0But, if you have a choice, don't go to this one,", "rating": "2", "date": [2011, 9, 28]}, "1": {"description": "Still waiting for clean locker rooms, disinfecting spray bottles with actual liquid in them, and civilized staff.

With that being said, I'm a person that values quality over quantity. Although they have a lot of machines and weights, they are older and outdated. There's always a machine broken, crusty treadmills covered in dried up sweat, and dusty circuit training equipment. It's so sad because I want to like the place so bad. Because it's so large, they should have more free weights. They only have two sets of every dumbbell. That's the same amount at the express XSport that I go to sometimes. It's always crowded and that's not very conducive to the workout environment. The locker rooms smell like crap and are so unsanitary. I swear I'm about to get a bacterial infection every time I step foot in there. Lastly, the staff is very unfriendly and arrogant. They facilitate an environment that isn't likeable and don't make it a welcoming experience every time. They scan my card and give it right back.

I ended up getting the shrimp coctail that night and my bf got some steak dinner. Well, my shrimp coctail was gross! While it was pretty big for their smallest size, and it contained a lot of shrimp, it was practically cold tap water with bit of ketchup and a few tiny pieces of avocado in it, ewwww. It had no taste, despite my efforts to revive it with a lot of hot sauce and ketchup, and was just overall nasty. My bf said his streak was a little dry and lacked flavor also, and this must have meant it was,really bad because he's not really picky when it comes to steak. When my bf mentioned our bad experience with his mom, who loves the place, she suggested we give it another try because she said the shrimp coctail was a relatively simple dish to make, so they probably dont put as much effort into it as they do the other dishes, and that my bf's steak wasn't as good because the place is really seafood oriented. It sounded reasonable, so we gave it another chance a few weeks later. They failed again! This time my bf and I both ordered the shrimp a la diabla dinner. Again, while there was a lot of shrimp in the dish, it lacked flavor. The sauce seemed like some generic bottled crap and only had a slight kick to it.

So Applebee's it was.Food was about what I expected for chain restaurant par, not gonna knock your socks off but just alright. I hate to say it, but the food wasn't quite as good as I was hoping it'd be. Thinking about all the things I ordered, I was hoping it'd be a slight bit better than it ended up being, and it reminded me(having only been to an Applebee's once before, believe it or not) how much I prefer similar sit down chains(i.e. Chili's, Bennigan's(too bad so, so few are left....), Ruby Tuesday) over Applebee's. OTOH though, the server we had was surprisingly good, and kept up with drink refills much better than I thought we would. Men's bathroom was surprisingly clean(too many chain restaurants have s***** bathrooms that aren't kept up, so I'll give credit where it's due here), bar patrons were pleasant and not annoying, no children I could hear were screaming anywhere in the restaurant, and the music wasn't annoying(they have a TouchTunes internet jukebox). Staff was also pleasant as well, but I can't get over the fact that while some of it was fine(i.e. strawberry tea my friend got), some of it seemed just average as well(i.e. fries, and the 3 cheese penne pasta I got). Overall the more I think about the food(edited on 1/29/14, due to the fact I was debating forever in my head if this is more 2 or 3 stars...), the more I realize to myself that it isn't quite 3 stars, but a hair short of that due to the food being not quite as good as I was hoping it'd be. Can't deny that they're other chain restaurants I just prefer, over Applebee's. The strawberry tea(think that's what it was my friend ordered?) wasn't bad, though. And of course, one of those times where I wish I could use a half star rating, since they were a strong 2.5 stars, that may as well be like 2.75.I wouldn't rush back here, but I'd be open to giving this location another shot. I like this location more than the one I went to in Hodgkins, a number of years back.

The waitress went into the back to ask about it and she returned saying that the cooks said it only comes with a citrus line vinaigrette. And put a dressing down and I asked if it was peanut sauce. She said yes and left. I tasted if and it wasn't peanut sauce. It was more citrus line vinaigrette.6. My husband enjoyed the steak and his salad. 7. My daughter enjoyed her mac n cheese and applesauce. 8. After attempting to eat my flavorless salad, I grabbed a menu. This is what was missing from my salad: edamame, almonds, peanut sauce. Stated right there in the menu! I was annoyed with our waitress that she relied on the kitchen staff to tell her what was in the salad instead of looking it up on her own. Or just knowing the menu, like she should. 9. I showed the menu to our waitress and she grabbed her manager. I explained the issue and he had the kitchen make a salad to go and comped the salad for us. He showed us the salad before we left so I could approve it. I just wanted to leave, so I ok'd it. The edamame was now visible and he pointed at an area that he said was peanut sauce.10. When I got home and put the salad away, I tastes it and there was definitely no peanut sauce anywhere.

Because my husband and kids were satisfied and because the salad was comped and the manager did try to solve the problem, I'm not too mad.

As we're waiting, a waitress is telling the manager about an altercation with a table saying how she doesn't care and it's not her fault and I quote \"bye, Felicia.\" Ghetto. And this is in front of a group of employees AND the manager AND us. So we get seated as the manager nonchalantly goes to talk to the table. They were out of crayons which was disappointing for my daughter but she lived. We ordered our food at the same times as our drinks as we had plenty of time before we were attended to. Our waiters pen died and he got another one. So he brings out the drinks. He asked everyone what their drinks were. So he calls out Sierra Mist- nobody answers and he says Sprite and my sister in law raises her hand. My husband joked that there must be a switch on the cup to switch the two. I DEFENDED the waiter. This was until he brought out the next drink. He called out a strawberry lemonade and handed it to my brother in law's girlfriend. She told her boyfriend she ordered pomegranate so he tells the server. \"Oh, that's what it is.\" She drank it but thought it tasted like strawberry.y motherinlaws coffee came at least 15 minutes late. She asked for 2% milk and he brought little creamers. My father in law told him they wanted milk and he said that is milk. No. It was cream. He brought out a cup to hold the cream. The kind that holds marinara sauce- awkward to pour from, no? It was so cold that most people had on coats and even a waitress mentioned how cold it was- that makes for an unpleasant experience in itself. so they bring the food. Well, most of it. The food was brought out by a good 5 different people- including the manager. My husband and brother in law both got the shrimp and steak. My brother in law's food had 2 little shrimps and my husband had 5. He asked for more shrimp as it was a SHRIMP AND STEAK. This meal comes with steamed vegetables. The carrots and broccoli were crunchy. They were just warmed up. My husband did not eat his steak. He has NEVER done that.. Even if the food is just ok, he'll still eat it. My father in law called the waiter over to tell him that he has the wrong sandwich as he had a blt and asked for a club. First he said it was a club - as expected. Then he consults the menu after asking my father in law what the difference was. He laughed and told him he was right- it wasn't what he ordered. He was laughing and joking. He went to the kitchen and said we got someone else's food- which we believe was what happened with the altercation at the beginning. We all finished eating - without any refills mind you. All of our glasses were empty. we never received our mozzarella sticks (we ordered 2 and got 1). \u00a0After we were all finished eating, they finally brought my father in laws food, at which time he asked for a box. To our surprise, we were still charged for the sandwich. As we were leaving the manager was at the hostess desk. He did not even acknowledge our presence.

I was a little frightened coming into this Applebee's and for good reason. First, the host/hostess station has no order or understanding whatsoever. People who came in after us put their names in before us with a little movement towards the front. After getting our names in and seated, we were greeted not by a server, but by a sticky table with so much trash at our feet that we had to brush it aside with our shoe. Being here as a tourist and not knowing much in the way of places to eat and after a long, long car ride from Dallas, we wanted to \u00a0just eat and get to our hotel. What a bad start!!Our server came over after about 15 minutes and asked if we were ready to order. As we were placing our order (both drink and food at the same time....lord knows we had enough time to decide), our server was being called Nana by some young kids in the corner, not at a table. After interrupting us several times to answer her grandchild, (also a little shocking as our waitress was somewhere in her 30's) we got our order placed and waited. Our food comes not delivered by our waitress but another server who was very attentive and polite. The food came out being held on the side of the plate by pot holders we knew our food was delivered hot and fresh for us from the MICROWAVE!!! I could have swung by Aldi or Walmart and had better food microwaved in our hotel room. The food ironically was pretty decent. The bread on my pasta plate was hard as a rock though. A poor victim of the microwave!! \u00a0After we finished our food we had to ask our waitress probably 3-4 times for the check. Our check was delivered to us 10 minutes later with only the paper, not book or anything and was soaked with god only knows what. In a strange twist of events , our credit card was taken almost immediately and promptly returned. As we were filling out the receipt, the table behind my wife was being cleared off, shocker to see all the food, napkins, straw wrappers, etc.. Being nicely flung into the floor to add to the pile. We were pretty disgusted with this place and wanted to leave ASAP. Upon our drive to the hotel, we stop at a red light only to be attacked by some guy with a bottle of windex and a window cleaner. After nicely telling him we didn't want our windows cleaned he does it anyway, rumbling on about us paying him the next time around. To our shock, this was witnessed by an undercover cop car behind us who grabs the man and put him in hand cuffs and then comes to our window asking if we wanted our windows cleaned. \u00a0When we told him we didn't, he cheerfully tells us he is arresting the man and tells us we can go.

I got the salt burn off of these flavors. It was pretty hearty and pretty filling, but I wouldn't sign myself up for a second round. It was kind of like... \"I'm eating this bowl and finishing it, only because I've already halfway invested in it.\" But the chicken was dry. The soup was very thick. It's a filler, but not super tasty or different, by any means, in my book.Green goddess wedge salad: Pleasant surprise! Green goddess tastes like thousand island dressing wanting to go green... pretty similar flavor profile, with more of a zing. Sweeter, maybe. But what caught me off guard is the candied bacon. Sweet and salty, with a little bit of a crisp. YUM! I'm not that big on bleu cheese, but it wasn't overpowering, and definitely helped blend all components together. That was a win.Shrimp scampi liguini: Flavorless linguini, and cooked all right. The shrimp was pretty good I guess... looked nearly translucent, had a slight fishy taste, which leaves me wondering whether that was a good or a bad thing. Is it fishier because it's going bad? cuz it wasn't cooked enough? I don't think I like questioning my food as I'm eating it. I know that sounds weird, but when you're eating to try and answer questions to life, that doesn't necessarily leave me with the itch to come back for more.Service: Weird. Food came out pretty quick, which was good. But I wish the waitress pointed out that there was a Monday special, which I SO would have jumped on! 6.99 for a burger and fries on monday? whaaaaa.....All food had come out while I was still working on my soup. She asked how everything was, but it was pretty evident that nothing aside from the soup had been touched. She never gave me a refil on my soda. And I would have ordered a small dessert (3.49 dessert shooters), but she dragged on coming back after I finished my food.It's a lot better since the applebees I last remembered!

However, they are helpful enough to make you feel comfortable about buying something through them in one of their catalogs.Erin walked us through the catalogs and told us the different price ranges. She was extremely knowledgeable about her furniture and I really felt like she was trying to help us find the right piece and not upsell us. When we came back two days later to make our purchase, Erin walked us through all the final decisions and even pulled couch pillows off of their models to help us find the perfect fabric. We decided on a beautiful Rowe sleeper sofa that was in our price range. Definitely a better deal than most places we have been to, and you just WANT to buy from them because they are so darn friendly and down to earth. Erin quoted us the amount the first time we came in, and our final price stayed true to that amount (plus taxes and delivery) which was great, because I feel like most places will pull random charges out of nowhere when you are about to hand them your credit card.Would highly, highly, highly recommend this place.

Definitely do your homework and look around a bit, but Far Below Retail could be your best bet. Having just moved to Chicago, I was daunted by the prospect of furnishing my 1-bedroom River North apartment. After scouring through Craigslist (including viewings), IKEA.com, and a bunch of other furniture store websites for a couch, I was feeling exasperated. I was even ready to head out to the suburbs to check out a mega furniture store or two (or three). Then I chanced upon FBR through Yelp. Since it was only a short walk away, I thought I'd try my luck. I had been warned about sleazy furniture salespeople in general, so I put on my \"the world is out to screw me but I won't let them\" cap. Bring it on. Thanks to Erin and Tony, I did not end up with battle scars that would stay with me for life. In fact, it was a very pleasant shopping experience altogether! They were willing to help me work within my budget, and did not hover or push sales while my mom and I were going through the catalog and testing out various couches. There had been an Ashley couch that I'd seen online that had looked promising, but it turned out to be uncomfortable. Arghhh... Then I came across a couch that I liked (a gorgeous chocolate brown recliner loveseat). Much to my dismay, it exceeded my price range by quite a bit. When I expressed my concern, Erin/Tony suggested that I take the (2 month old) floor model for a reduced price. Still above my budget so they threw in the pillows too. They also said it could be delivered the next day. Ok, DEAL. My thinking was that if I was going to sit on it for the next few years, I might as well invest... I kept my fingers crossed the next 24 hours awhile I waited for my couch, but it turned out I didn't need to do that. The movers arrived slightly ahead of schedule and I didn't need to lift a finger. Done!Now, a few days later, I absolutely love my couch and am so happy I decided to invest in it!

We were in the market for a sleeper sofa for a new second bedroom. We couldn't decide if we wanted to go with a cheapy one or get a nicer one for when guests stay. We had looked all around at the big furniture stores and had a couple of \"finalists\" in mind. We came to Far Below Retail since the reviews were so good and it was close to our church so we thought we'd give it a try. As soon as we walked in, Erin and Tony were so welcoming, friendly, and gave us the low down and a glass of wine for me and beer for the husband. Erin sat with us and told us about the different options of sleeper sofas. It's a big warehouse, but only a handful of selections on the floor, which I could see as a bummer since I like to see something before I purchase it. However, they are helpful enough to make you feel comfortable about buying something through them in one of their catalogs.Erin walked us through the catalogs and told us the different price ranges. She was extremely knowledgeable about her furniture and I really felt like she was trying to help us find the right piece and not upsell us. When we came back two days later to make our purchase, Erin walked us through all the final decisions and even pulled couch pillows off of their models to help us find the perfect fabric. We decided on a beautiful Rowe sleeper sofa that was in our price range. Definitely a better deal than most places we have been to, and you just WANT to buy from them because they are so darn friendly and down to earth. Erin quoted us the amount the first time we came in, and our final price stayed true to that amount (plus taxes and delivery) which was great, because I feel like most places will pull random charges out of nowhere when you are about to hand them your credit card.Would highly, highly, highly recommend this place.

Eight days ago, we went into this store. We quickly selected a couch. We would have happily bought the couch on the floor, but they encouraged us to look through their samples and get any variations on it that we would like. We chose just a few variations. The perky saleswoman very casually told us, \" Oh yeah, we'll just send off these specs and call you the second it hits our floor.\" We never asked for a date because her demeanor suggested that it would be in quickly. We spent approximately $2000. When she handed us the terms and conditions she discouraged us from reading it, pointing to where to sign and saying \"this just means that if you don't like the couch, you can't send it back.\" When we hadn't heard in over a week, we called them. They told us the sofa would not be in for five more weeks.My husband called them. The saleswoman was rather rude and unhelpful. Rather than trying to fix the problem, she told my husband, \"Well, how long did you expect it to take?\" He responded with, \"I didn't know. You're the furniture professional. It was your job to tell me. \" She refused to take responsibility and continually implied that we should have expected it would take six weeks without being informed. They refused to cancel the order and give our money back despite that it was five \u00a0more weeks until we got the sofa. We even were willing to go with the original floor model, but they told us that it would be three weeks because, according to them, \"it's our best seller and if we sold it, we would lose thousands.\" In other words, they would rather mislead customers to make thousands of dollars than run a customer-oriented business with integrity. Finally, they cited the terms and conditions that we were discouraged from reading, stating that there were no refunds once the order was put in. This was the exact same person that discouraged us from reading it in the first place. Normally, I am quite vigilant about reading those, but they had inspired so much trust that I let her rush us through. If, after you read this, you still decide to shop here, be sure that you both get an estimated date in writing and don't let them deter you from reading their own Terms and Conditions.

I definitely have some work ahead of me as there are some repairs and updates that are needed. \u00a0For me, that means I am on a budget. \u00a0I have some big expenses that I am planning for. My top 3 priorities to get done asap are 1. Replacing all light fixtures 2. Painting the entire condo 3. Finding a sectional. I have been researching furniture for the past 6 months. I knew what I wanted. Clean lines, contemporary, \u00a0COMFORTABLE, \u00a0made well. \u00a0 But I told myself to stick to a budget. \u00a0$1500.00 is the limit I set for myself. \u00a06 months of research lead me to finally realize that everything I found that met my style and standards were all over $3k. \u00a0Buying such a large piece of furniture is an investment. \u00a0I don't plan on getting another sofa for a long time. I would love to be able to spend $3k or more for some of the furniture that I have found, but I can't. Finally, \u00a0I came across Far Below Retail on Yelp. I was a bit hesitant as I have gone to similar stores to only find traditional, \u00a0and not at all contemporary furniture. \u00a0Not to mention very limited options. \u00a0To my surprise, Far Below Retail has some great, modern suppliers. I found a great sectional with amazing manufacturer warranties. \u00a0The sectional is made to order. \u00a0I selected the fabric, leg color and positioning of the chaise. Though I would had liked to see more floor models for examples, \u00a0I felt like there was enough there for me to imagine what my final sofa will look like. For me, knowing what I wanted before coming in helped. There are so many directions you could go in here that having an idea of where to start is key.

I still need to get mattresses and frames for my spare rooms, shelving, and lots of other stuff. Now I feel like I can actually get it all done fairly quickly since their prices allow me to get more bang for my buck.Oh. And the sectional I ordered. I only payed $45.00 over my budget. \u00a0I can't get that price on a sectional that size from ikea.

We visited on Saturday 2/28/15 around 1:30pm. There were 2 other people in restaurant, surprising with the recommendation I had received. The windows of the restaurant which span the entire of the building were covered in muddy dirt and snow, from what looked like a snow plow coming by and splashing the windows. There was no music playing, there was a very loud soccer game on 1 of the 5 TVs that were on. The tables, bar, tile work, gelato display case, espresso machine all looked very nice, new you could see into the kitchen right to the pizza oven. There was a Specials board that said that the soup of the day was Spinach Gnocci? When our server came by and my friend inquired about the soup of the day. She looked over at the board and said, \"Whoa, that's weird, that is my handwriting from November.\" Its almost MARCH! She said the soup now was chicken noodle egg drop. Huh? Despite that, he ordered a cup. I ordered a Caesar Salad. We also had a Sprite (which was poured out of a 2 liter bottle behind the bar) and a Iced Tea (didn't see it but it tasted like Arizona Green Tea). The salad came out and it was not a Caesar Salad. \u00a0It was a bowl filled with mixed greens and romaine tossed in a balsamic \"looking\" dressing. No other veggies, just greens. Not sure this salad was even on the menu. Fortunately it tasted like nail polish remover! Seriously, I had my friend taste it and he agreed. Did she ask me if I liked it? NO, she didn't even ask me if there was something wrong with it? My friends soup, not he other hand, was exactly what he ordered, egg drop chicken noodle soup with spinach. Bland, no flavor and the chicken you could bounce on the table like a basketball. It was so rubbery and cubed that is had to have been some frozen soup mix. Not an Italian's grandmothers recipe for sure. Then we ordered our pizzas, a Florentina (spinach and 3 cheeses) and a Funghi (sausage and mushroom). The pizzas took about 30 minutes. Which surprised me being that we were the only ones in the restaurant eating. The other couple were just having coffee and a gelato-shake. Every wood-fire oven, being that is what it said on the menu, takes about 10-12 minutes to cook, thats the novelty. The pizza came out and the entire area around the crust was burned. When I grabbed a slice and picked it up, the slice fell and all the ingredients with it onto the plate. I piled everything back on and bit into the mound of \"pizza\" and realized that the underneath of the pizza was not cooked. It was doughy. I looked at the bottom of the pizza and it wasn't even brown. Was this pizza broiled? Or baked?Well we didn't finish the pizza, never got asked if there was something wrong with our food but she did ask it we wanted boxes? Hmm. My friend, who recommend the place, said he would take care of the bill, he felt bad. No biggie. He didn't own the place. So I went to use the restroom to wash up....Oh yes, this one got me. The automatic paper towel dispenser is right above the urinal. Huh? So as I walk up to the urinal a towel dispensed. Well this towel dispenser was set to roll out the maximum amount of paper. Yup, right into the urinal, were I am... Yea you got the picture. As I come out from the restroom, my friend is holding his credit card in his had with a bewildered look on his face. I ask, \"what's up?\" He tells me that the computers were down so they can't run a credit card. So I asked the server if they had a manual one (knuckle buster). She said no, \"He is gonna want cash.\" She told us that there was no ATM, but there was a bank 2 blocks down the road. So with the wind out of his sales, and about to crack, my friend leaves and starts walking down the street. What I didn't know, is that he also order two small gelato's for us, probably to make up for his bad recommendation. So as he was out in the cold walking to the bank, that was not his bank, so he had to pay a $4.00 ATM fee, I was about to enjoy my chocolate gelato......I have never had freezer burned gelato. Gelato with ice crystals surrounding it. So frozen that our server that was scooping it, couldn't even get it out of the pan. Even though the menu said, made daily. When my friend returned with cash, he walks over to the counter and lays down the money. He looked into the kitchen and noticed the owner working on the line. The one she had pointed too saying, \"he is gonna want cash.\" The same guy that made my nail polish salad, which was not what I ordered, dished out the soup, and made the pizzas and served them to us in that their raw and not appealing state. My friend also noticed that the really cool pizza oven, was turned off, strange because the menu said it was a wood fire oven and there was no wood inside, just a gas oven, not even turned on. No wonder our pizzas were not cooked all the way. He had the oven turned off to save money.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 3, 1]}, "9": {"description": "Because we had a good experiences in the past \u00a0and we like to support local business, we came by for a quick family dinner on an unusually slow Friday night.

I gave them all my necessary measurements and details. \u00a0( I had my husband measure.) The salesperson and I agreed on the 12 year GE.The day arrives for the unit to be installed. \u00a0The job was assigned to this particular Home Depot, and they jobbed the work to an awful company by the name of PIT. 2 guys pull into my alley, go through my basement door and then inform me that in order for me to have the hot water heater installed, I would have to give them $250 COD. \u00a0 They then told me that sorry, I'd have to settle for the 9 year because a 12 year won't fit. \u00a0I think the fact that I am a woman gave these two jerks the stupidity to think that they could take advantage of me. \u00a0I immediately called Home Depot's home services department to find out if this was correct. \u00a0No one had informed me that I was to give anyone anything COD. \u00a0I was correct. \u00a0They were trying to scam me. \u00a0Their home services department called PIT to find out what the heck was going on. \u00a0Of course these guys lied and said no, they did not ask me for that amount of money, they lied and said that it was $60 in additional parts. \u00a0I was relayed this info by their home services department and instructed not to pay anything COD and that the additional $60 would be put on my Home Depot card. \u00a0And the hot water discrepancy? \u00a0Let's just say that these jerks didn't have any other water heater on their truck. \u00a0In finalizing the installation, these jerks did not supply me with any warranty information, manuals etc. \u00a0They then proceed to ask me again for the $250 in which I informed them that I already spoke to home services and was instructed not to pay them. \u00a0They were not happy. \u00a0I then tried repeatedly to obtain the warranty info and manuals from this particular location to no avail.In November of 2007, my husband special ordered a new screen door for our back door. \u00a0We had custom ordered a security door at another Home Depot many years ago, and did not have any issues. \u00a0He went over the size specifics with the mill worker on duty and went over the the details on how to proceed measuring for this particular door. \u00a0Our door did not arrive until 3 days before Christmas Eve. \u00a0It was way too cold to try and install it. \u00a0We finally had one day of good weather and my husband proceeded to install it. \u00a0The measurements were all wrong. \u00a0Why because the guy on duty told him to measure from the inside, not the outside. \u00a0We called them to complain and they basically told us tough luck, it's a custom order, all sales are final. \u00a0My husband had to build a new frame around our door frame in order to make it work. \u00a03 days later, the entire door split in half sideways, not from where my husband installed the frame or anywhere near the pieces that he had to install but the actual door that we received, where the glass is held in place by the two pieces of aluminum! \u00a0The nails that were in place to hold the actual door together were to short and exposed the particle board in between. \u00a0It happened when I was home alone with the little one, and I almost fell down the porch stairs. \u00a0It was really heavy, and I had a really hard time carrying it down the steps.My husband called to complain and speak with a manager 4 times as it was a manufacturer defect. \u00a0We just wanted someone to come and look at the door and replace it. \u00a0 No one would return his calls. \u00a0After a week of being told that the managers were away or they were in a meeting, and not receiving any call back, I pulled out my bitch card and called corporate. \u00a0I had all the info on the door, when phone calls were made, and names of who we dealt with. \u00a0I also had pictures of the damage ready to email. \u00a0Corporate was very apologetic and accommodating. \u00a0They returned our purchase in full via gift card so that we can purchase a new door altogether and not have to deal with this particular store again.

They offer typical Chicago fare, at very decent prices, and always made extremely fresh and made to order. I usually say otherwise, but this actually IS one of the places where I come for the fries. The proprietor is an older Greek man with his son working the register, and sometimes his wife working alongside them on busier days. The fries are freshly cut for each order, and double fried to perfection. He gives you one giant russett potato, so it's a really good portion.

From the roll, to the medium well, deliciously marinated steak, seasoned with a little bit of oregano, and loaded up with onions, tomato, and au jus. I think the charcoal grill is what makes these steak sandwiches, as well as the freshness of the steaks. It's just so juicy and so smoky, and with the perfect fries, it's hard to get any better than Mr. D's. The steak sandwich hits the spot so well for me, that I don't usually have room to try anything else.

It's a bit tougher, just a tad bit chewier at times. But the secret is that it really holds in the flavor of the marinade or seasonings that Mr. D is using. I ordered mine with tomato and onion and the veggies were VERY fresh, well seasoned and enhanced the sandwich no doubt. So did the bread, which was like a french bread bun but not as firm, almost like a burger bun. This was key b/c is allowed the juices to quickly soak up in the bread, which gave it a cheese filled texture.The fries were excellent. Someone else mentioned they tasted like Gene and Judes and I completely agree. However, the fries at Gene and Judes, IMO, get a bit mushy when wrapped up with the dog. The fries here at Mr. D's stay crispy and crunchy as soon as they hit the table. Prices appear to have gone up a bit here. My steak sandwich was $7.15 before tax.

So I had the opportunity to evaluate the buffet without having to consider its costs.It is remarkably crowded here, to the point that you're probably going to be almost running into somebody every time you get a plate of food. To make matters worse, for some reason there aren't any forks at the end of the buffets. Just spoons and knives. The forks are off on some other table, and it took me a good five minutes to figure that out. In general despite appearing to be located in a recently-constructed strip mall, the place looked dusty and aged.The food ranged from decent to awful. You should stick with the steamed fish; both the tilapia and salmon were flaky and tasty. The steamed octopus with jalape\u00f1o (I did not know this was even a thing) was a weird combination of flavors, but decent. There was some sort of springy, fried fish ball with a stick in it. Seek out the dishes with real crab meat.And that's the end of it. The onion rings and anything with imitation crab meat were terrible. The crab rangoon wasn't too bad, but pretty plain. The pineapple chicken was made with boneless chicken thighs (good) but otherwise pretty plain; the Kung Pao chicken next to it actually made me nauseous, which doesn't happen all that often. Fortunately they have Vienna sausages wrapped in bacon, because... well, I don't know why, but it was all right.I didn't tempt fate with anything in the warmers, and anything and everything in the dessert section just wasn't good unless you stuck with the fresh fruit, of which the selection was also limited.

You can smell the delicious grease from outside. I got my hopes up. We ordered, got our food, and went home.I dove into the bag and grabbed the tinfoil that held my cheese quesadilla. When I opened it, I was sorely disappointed. It was TINY! I'm used to the giant quesadillas that I get from TBK and various other places. This one took 3-4 bites to finish, the sour cream was runny, and the tortilla was dry and gross. My boyfriend said the nachos weren't terrible, but they weren't good.

I ran a few errands this last sunday and decided to stop in and give them a try. It was about 11:15 and they were fully seated. It looked like there were only two waitresses who had their hands full. People wanted to leave to make room for people leaving but were waiting to get checks. A party of 6 came in after me and an elderly couple as well. The couple left, not wanting to wait. The party of 6 was seated before me which kind of bothered me as I had been waiting about 10 min by that time and I saw that a table was opening up. Ok, I get a 6 party table will make more $s than a 1 person table, but they had to wait about another 5 min for the table next to the empty one to clear to seat the party of 6 and another table right next to it was clearing out as well. Since I knew another table would be available soon I did not say anything. The menu is very large. I ordered a small bisquit and gravy, and Denver omlette with pancakes instead of toast. \u00a0The bisquit was large and fluffy but the gravy lacked flavor and had very little sausage in it. The pancakes were kind of chewy. The omlette was a good size and fluffy and not overcooked and the cheese was in the middle like it should be and not off to one end. The hash browns were nicely crispy on top. Service is about as good as it can be for a very busy small establishment. Like I said, it looked like there were only 2 waitresses there that day. I am not sure how many the establishment seats, it is not large. Sometimes it can take a bit to get your waitress' attention. The place is clean and neat. It was standard breakfast fare - but I did not order anything fancy. Definitely better than going to chain restaurant for breakfast food.

We had previously had a really rotten day of couch shopping at discount stores like Ashley, The Room Place and Value City Furniture, etc. These places did not have fabric options and I found, perhaps surprisingly, not that much cheaper than Cassona .... plus most of the couches were ungoldy uncomfortable and certainly of a lower quality. I wanted a gray couch which is apparently impossible, IMPOSSIBLE I tell you, to get at these aforementioned discount stores. Walking into Cassona I was presented with at least 3 beautiful gray couches plus tons and tons of fabric options. All the couches were very comfortable too, it was quite hard to decide since I was finally faced with beautiful couches in fabrics and colors I loved that had actual lumbar support. We ended up deciding on a 3 person sofa with chaise. The chaise is moveable/removable as it comes with a long cushion and an ottoman underneath that can be moved to the middle or other side of the couch, plus an extra cushion if you want to remove the ottoman entirely. The versatility to change the couch is a great option. The couches all seem to come with 2 accent pillows too and we got to choose through many many more fabrics for those. What I liked most about Cassona, other than the beautiful and not absurdly expensive furniture, was the helpfulness and honesty of the staff. John helped us yesterday and offered lots of helpful tips in choosing a couch and a fabric, explained the different kinds of fabric and how they wear and should be cleaned, explained the warranty and didn't pressure us to purchase. It was nice not feeling uncomfortable about coming back the next day to think it over through the night. We did in fact come back today and the owner helped us place our order and answered more questions. Everything about Cassona is class, from the style of furniture to the care from the staff. Quite a different experience from Ashley Furniture and Value City where I didn't have a singe sales rep offer any information on how the fabric wears or how one should clean it etc. I cannot wait for the couch to arrive!

I moved to a new condo and abandoned a lot of old furniture starting off with a clean slate in the new pad.

Combine this with the fact that I am clueless and illiterate when it comes to interior design and that sort of thing, I didn't even have the terminology to say what I liked or wanted !! So it was a with a lot of trepidation I ventured into the store in Andersonville, the first encouraging sign was that they let me browse, a sales person checked in with me when I arrived and then let me explore and look for ideas. When I finally had some clue as to what I wanted I was lucky enough to be looked after by John who was amazing. He very patiently went through my lists, spent ages going through swatches with me, gently and diplomatically eased me away from my more horrendous choices and was genuinely interested in making the whole process work for me. At no point did I get the feeling that I was being encouraged to buy the more expensive choices and because of the size of the order he worked out a very generous discount. The furniture arrived this weekend and I could not be more pleased, I had brought some photographs with me of my new place on my first visit and that helped a lot, now that its all installed the entire package works. The delivery was efficient and very professional. My impression is that the philosophy in this store is that If they help you make good choices they will have a happy (return) customer and that's more effective in the long run than just selling you the most expensive item on the floor. It certainly worked for me, I'm back next week for round two, the rugs and tchotchkes and stuff to 'pull it together', under John Zotti's careful eye of course !!

Ordering furniture can be a bit of an adventure, and special ordering makes it even more so. \u00a0All you can ask of a retailer is that they keep their promises, do their best, and treat you properly. \u00a0Cassona did all of that. \u00a0The damage problems weren't their fault: \u00a0all they could do is react to those problems as quickly as possible and try to make things right. \u00a0And that's EXACTLY what they did. \u00a0If not for the manufacturer's quality issues, Cassona would have delivered the bed several weeks earlier than promised, and that's how they should be judged (along with how they worked to resolve the problems). \u00a0That's why I wanted to leave such a thorough review: \u00a0they deserved to be acknowledged for their excellent efforts. \u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY order from Cassona again, and if you're reading this, you should too. \u00a0They will do everything possible to make sure you have the best possible experience.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 2, 8]}, "38": {"description": "It's only in the last few years that I've graduated from Target and IKEA into the world of good furniture.

The order was resent and no harm done, food was okay, but was very very late.- From that point on, it seemed every order was late - this from a place that is maybe 5 minutes away.- Pizza toppings ordered 'not in stock'- We request crisp/well done crust always.. and got \u00a02 pizzas with soggy mushy crusts.- Another order - Eggplant Parm, which I order a lot, arrives ice cold - not just from cold weather - but ICE cold. As this order was late, again (and again, all the late orders are a new thing) I just reheat it and eat it - and - I get a whomping case of food poisoning from it, ugh.

Our most recent order.. More than TWO HOURS after we ordered, we receive a call saying our order will be on its way 'shortly'. TWO HOURS to tell us this? And we are pretty much regular customers - for years, you'd think maybe someone would have taken a minute to let us know they were in the weeds a little earlier??

It's not just that you can get far better deals in them, it's the sheer exoticism of these places that really appeals. \u00a0There's nothing oppressively sterile or buttoned-up about places like Avenue Food Mart, a nifty Eastern European (mostly Polish) market that's just around the corner from DOM ITP on Belmont. There's a small bakery and a deli/meat counter , but they were both so jammed that I avoided them as much as possible (My last trip to Caputo's made me want to take a hatchet to the idiots who park their carts diagonally in the aisles and then stand next to them talking on their cell phones or staring blankly into space.) But there's more than enough to see in the rest of the store. The produce section really isn't much to crow about, which surprised me a little, but there's a very nice dairy section where we found the elusive Danio coconut yogurt and bought the last three cartons. As for the rest, it can be summed up by saying: If it's a vegetable, you'll find it pickled. \u00a0If it's a fruit, you'll find it made into preserves of some sort. \u00a0If it's a meat or fish, there'll be tins of it in various forms, most often p\u00e2t\u00e9. If it can be made into cookies, candy or some other sort of pastry, you'll find a package of it, and you will be overwhelmed by walls of condiments (How many different sorts of mustard and horseradish can one person keep in their fridge?), juice and tea. The liquor section is smallish, but there is a lot of beer and vodka, and liqueurs you've probably never heard of before.You will buy things even if you're not sure what they are because they look so good.But the bottom line at a store like this is that you'll get a lot of bang for your buck, and have the opportunity to try things you might never have tried if you'd stuck to Jewel or Dominick's. You might even find that you love the Polish rye you can't find anywhere else, or the lingonberry horseradish, or the celery salad, or the mixed fruit syrup...

Well, Avenue Food Mart gives them some serious competition a few miles west of there. I used to shop here more often when I lived in the neighborhood, before it burned down and rebuilt nearly a decade ago. I haven't visited them for some time. Coming back after a long absence was a real eye-opener.I was in the area, so I thought I would stop in and get some Easter basket essentials. I was mainly looking for Andrulis brand farmer cheese, which Jerry's and Shop-n-Save by me no longer carry. Not only did I find it at a great price, it became my one-stop shop for everything else in my Easter basket: round hams about the size of a baseball, small sausage loops to fit a candle in the middle, hot horseradish spread, and even a beautiful chocolate and white glaze Easter bundt cake from their huge bakery selection. Avenue's centerpiece and anchor is their enormous deli, spanning the width of the store. Not only does it carry every variety of sausage, ham, poledwica (Canadian bacon) but also has fresh fish, meat, and cheeses. They also have ready-made soups, salads and other Polish specialties. Since it was 2 days before Good Friday, the line was huge and I was #89 though #77 was being served at the time. The number dispenser is off to the left of the deli counter, near the dairy section, which made it confusing just to get a number in the first place. However, I counted 12 people working in the deli area. My turn came in under 10 minutes and I got what I needed quickly. Avenue makes its own sausages and even has a real smokehouse. Not the corrosive liquid smoke that can dissolve stainless steel, but real smoked meat. The flavor makes all the difference in the world. And they don't overprice their meat as if the products deserve some \"premium markup\" of a boutique/import grocer. I bet the local residents must love the smell of freshly smoked meat in the air daily. That alone would keep me coming back.Avenue also carries lots of Polish imported chocolates, jams, syrups, candy and cookies. They even have Polish children's books and a good selection of magazines. There's a liquor section too. Produce is their one weakness, so I can't give it a 5-star rating. Checkouts are quick. Be warned that the predominant language spoken is Polish. When they call your number at the deli, watch the display board carefully unless you can count in Polish.

And after 3 days of utter nonsense, I submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.Louis eventually offered to let us exchange the sofa for an additional $100, claiming that the manual is $300 cheaper (which is not true). We declined the offer as we were given a price and a receipt at the time of sale and should not be asked for any additional money to cover *their* mistake. After their initial unwillingness to work with me, there was no way I would agree to even that. We told him to honor the receipt or take it all back. He even tried to \"reason\" that we received a 19 inch TV (which is about the size of cereal box), as if it had anything to do with the fact that they messed up our order. The lack of professionalism on all their parts was both infuriating and astounding.**UPDATE**- A month later we received the correct sofa... thanks to the BBB complaint.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 12, 15]}, "13": {"description": "In early September I went to The Room Place.

We purchased our kitchen appliances from this store. One of the items was not in stock at the time, and a week or so later when the item came in, without warning they credited our account and then charged us again. Because credits don't come through instantaneously, and the amount they did this with was quite large, it completely screwed up our bank account and caused an overdraft. Like an idiot, a month later I went to the same store to buy a washer. The washer was 10% off and the state was offering an additional instant 15% rebate. The cashier didn't know that she needed to do anything to process the instant rebate. Once I pointed out that she didn't do it correctly, we needed to cancel the transaction. Instead of canceling the transaction, she put it through, refunded it, and charged me again. So now there is - again - \u00a0a bunch of money missing from my bank account that will take several days to get back. She also said she'd checked out several customers who thought they had gotten the rebate, but apparently they had not. These employees need to be more careful with customers accounts, and learn what how to do their jobs. The service in general here is generally awful. I've been told over the phone that they have items, and 15 minutes later when I get there I find that this item was not in stock. I've asked employees where simple basic hardware items are, and they have no idea what I'm talking about.

Lowe's is relatively close to my house, which has been nice since we have been making several trips a week to get materials. Unfortunately, many of these trips have been very displeasing. On one of our first trips to Lowes, we make an attempt to rent a hardwood floor sander. We ask an employee walking buy how we are to go about doing that and this particular employee is unsure. No big deal, we'll ask someone else. So... the mext person we ask is unsure too, but he is going to go to get a fellow employee to help, which turns out to be a person whom also doesn't know. Finally, we track down a fourth person, someone who can help us. He says he thinks he heard that one of them is broken, but he isn't sure which one that is. Apparently, he just picked the newer looking one for us and assumed it would work. We pay and take it out to our car. We can't find anyone to lift it up into our car, but grab a kid in the parking lot who agrees to help us. When we get home, we realize that this sander was the broken sander. UGH. So we pack up the sander and drive back to Lowes to retrieve the other sander that they have displayed on the floor. Again, we cannot find anyone to help us. So we just wheel it right out of the store--and no one even stopped to ask us any questions! Just let us wheel out thousands of dollars worth of equipment right out of the store without any receipts. We get out to the car and we find two Lowe's employees and ask them to help us load the sander into our car. They take the old sander out and put the new sander in. When they finish, they leave the old sander sitting in the parking lot and walk away. REALLY now?! Who does that? It was hysterical. They obviously really care about their jobs... So anyway... We get the sander home only to find that this sander is also broken. Believe it.... we gave them a mouthful. But it didn't matter because they didn't hear one word of it.

I never had any strong feelings for Lowe's before, though for some reason I leaned toward it a bit more than Home Depot (for some reason, it seems a little cleaner in a Lowe's than an HD, and less warehouse-y).We went to this Lowe's, instead of the one in Lincolnwood that is 10 minutes away, because they had an A/C installer available. We purchased two A/C units and signed a contract for installation with them, with the promise by the clerk that we would receive a call within 48 hours to set up a time for installation.I called the following Saturday - after almost a week had gone by (we purchased on a Sunday) to find out why we hadn't been called, and to set up an installation. The girl who answered informed me that the people who work in that department were not there past 4 pm on Saturday. The next time I called I did get an employee in the installation sales department, and she informed me that the reason our purchase hadn't been installed was because we had been charged for installation of only one of the A/C units, not two. Of course I was a bit annoyed by this, and she went on to say that she could charge the second installation to the same credit card and set up a time for installation. I told her that since it wasn't my card, it wasn't my place to allow them to charge additional funds, and that I would have to find out when would be a good time for installation (both of us work during the week, and since it had been a week already we didn't want to have to wait until the following weekend for installation).We called again to find out what the total charge would be and what installation dates & times were available, and learned that she had in fact charged the additional fee (over $100) to the credit card. At that point, we refused to allow the service and demanded a refund of the installation charges. I haven't been to Lowe's since, and don't plan on returning anytime soon; I also make sure to let people know to be careful when dealing with them.The whole experience bothered me on several levels. For one thing, the woman in installation sales made several assumptions; one, that I was the wife of the credit card holder; the second being that if I was the wife, I would automatically be an authorized user of the credit card. On top of that, we paid for an installation of at least one of the units, even if the employee who rang up our purchase forgot to charge a second one. Since we didn't get any break on more than one installation (it was the same charge per installation for 1 or 10 installations), they should have come out to install the first unit, then come out a second time if they had to.

I can't get a red bull or a soda at the door, the bathrooms are filty. (Ladies, when you are a contractor, you may only get to go at these places) just one disappointment after another. Prices aren't all that competitive and you can't ask a trade question to kid working a weekend job.I know why I frequent Menards & Home Depot...

A shed, it was the only one I could find that was 8x10, without a floor, for around $900. I also purchased the lumber to build the floor myself, \u00a016 inch centers for heavy stuff. Got the shed home and some of the parts were missing.This would usually \"p\" me off pretty bad, but when I called them they asked me what I was missing and told me to come and get the parts.On my way there, I went by Menards to look at the same shed and it was $749.00. \u00a0This Lowe's refunded the 100 dollars I paid them over Menard's cost plus ten percent. A young kid let me pull my truck in the service bay and load my truck when I made the original purchase. Can't believe I haven't \u00a0been back to this Lowe's.", "rating": "5", "date": [2008, 6, 8]}, "4": {"description": "My family ordered a new washing machine several weeks ago. They were supposed to bring it the following Saturday, but never showed up. When we called, they said they couldn't find our machine and weren't sure when it would be coming. So, two weeks later they finally come and guess what... They REFUSED to install it, even though we paid for installation!!!! So then after going to the store they were basically like, oh sorry I guess, here's your installation money back. You can buy a hose for a dollar and try to do it yourself. Whaaaaatttt?!?!?!?!

It's been a nightmare. Lowe's takes all your money upfront, leaving you with no leverage. They make design decisions without consulting you. Take longer than promised. Speak to you disrespectfully. If you don't email everyday they'll forget about your project. And when they make mistakes, which they will, it's like pulling teeth to have Lowe's fix the problems. I entirely regret using Lowe's for installation and I wouldn't wish anyone else to go through the same headaches.
