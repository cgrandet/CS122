Mc'd aint deliverin' and you really aint goin out anywhere so why the hell not?If you order traditional, known pizza combinations you are safe. Veer into their specialty pizzas and the uncharted territory becomes very murky and quite unpredictable. I mean really really unpredictable. The BBQ chicken pizza is chunks of chicken breast with cheese on top then BBQ sauce is seemingly added on top. And it seemed like where the tomato sauce should be was BBQ sauce too. I was confused to look at it and my taste buds were entirely perplexed.Ordered garlic bread with marinara. Got charged for the marinara but not the garlic bread. Only got the marinara. Not the garlic bread. Why the hell would anyone order a side of marinara sauce with BBQ chicken pizza? The idea made me want to vomit.Never been to the brick and mortar restaurant. Pretty sure I'm not missing much. I'll continue to order from here basically because it is in my hood and the options are limited late night. Will I like it?

My boyfriend lives near this location, so we'll stop in every now and then to grab a pizza. We went in last weekend and sat at a high top in the bar area. The bartender (I think his name was Mike) Served us. We got a thin crust and a half antipasto salad (perfect for 2). The Salad was really good, it was our first time getting it, and the thin crust is always pretty tasty. I like that the sauce is sweet. \u00a0Everything came out in a timely manner and our server was really nice. My only complaint is that we sat right near the area where the servers congregate in front of the kitchen window, so we heard every bit of their personal conversations. I worked in restaurants for years so I understand how it goes,especially since the place was dead, but we would have liked to not hear every detail of their night's plans or how they wished they would be sent home soon. I've also noticed that almost every time I come here, I am absolutely freezing. I am not sure if its because there are so many windows or just a coincidence.

When asked for explanation, considering we had paid Estate for their venue for OUR party with OUR guests, guests were told to \"f**k off\" and called \"b*tches.\" The majority of our guests paid additional money for open bar access for 4 hours, but coincidentally, security felt the need to throw people out (many who had purchased the open bar access deal) within the first hour of our event -- a sketchy business move that cheated hundreds of our guests of what added up to be thousands of dollars. Besides the rude and unprofessional staff who removed people from our private party at our leisure, the venue itself was not fun. Guests weren't dancing because there was no clear spot for a dance floor, and compared to the many other venues we've hosted events at, this was by far the most dull, had the worst food (and not much of it at all despite paying a hefty sum for it), and was on the smaller side (especially given the price).I will never be going back to Estate, and given the horrible time that the majority of my guests had, I don't think anyone in the organization will ever be returning again.Edit: Even more disappointing, after our organization's feedback, management promised at least a partial refund to a representative of our organization for members of our party who had been thrown out, which was much appreciated.

Then one of the bouncers saw me sipping from my friend's glass (purely because neither of us wanted to drink a lot so we decided to share), quickly assumed that she was trying to pass drinks onto a minor, and started throwing us out. We tried to explain to them the situation and presented our IDs (Authentic Illinois Driver's Licenses, it's not even like we were using some obscure foreign ID). The bouncers clearly seemed to have an \"Oh shit maybe I made a mistake\" look but quickly decided to continue kicking us out instead of apologizing that they've made a mistake.

I have an EMAILED receipt stating this time frame as well. When we go to the bar, at 5:45pm, we were told the deal didn't start til 7:30 and ended at 10:30pm. I didn't pay for that time frame, I paid from 5:00pm-1:00am. No one contacted me telling me there was a change of time, so once we were there, almost 2 hours before the deal we already purchased started, we had to pay for our drinks, meaning we HAD to spend more money. We had an additional $60 dollar tab for our group. Since the bar knew they were offering a drink special during the game, they should have been more properly staffed. There were 2 bartenders and a bar back. The bar back was very nice, and pouring beers, getting cans, but he wouldn't take food orders. He said we had to order from the bartender. I think it confused a lot of people. Besides being under staffed, they also were under supplied. The deal offered select cans and drafts and before halftime, they were out of 3 of the 5 beers being offered. The only option people had was Bud Light and 312 drafts, and some people don't like draft beer for fear of dirty lines and a huge headache the next day. They ran out of Stella before the first quarter was over. I know it was busy, but the bar was offering this deal, they should have known to be ready for a crowd. Lastly, \"beer nuggets\" during the game were included in the package. They set tiny bowls on the bar and it was pretty much a free for all. People were 2 rows deep at the bar reaching over people's heads to grab what they could. I didn't see one bowl get replaced once emptied. So not only were the \"nuggets\" already sparce, once they were gone, that was it. They were gone. We asked for a new bowl since our surrounding patrons hoarded them, but we were told there were no more. Overall, it was a horrible first experience.

It was our intention to have brunch and sit on the roof. However, we were told that there is NO brunch because it was not the weekend (fair enough it technically wasnt, we assumed that they would do brunch on the holiday, not a safe assumption), and the rooftop is only open at night (a big mistake in my opinion! They are missing out on the summer brunch crowd, who are looking for a great rooftop (check), with a good food and drink selection (check), and located ON the water/ breathtaking view of the city (check). All of which this location boasts, but does not utilize to their advantage!! Additionally, you would think that Estate would indicate somewhere on their website that their roof is only open at night we assumed it would be open when the venue is open (the website says call for rooftop hours of operation, my bad). We arrived around 12:30 and the place was DEAD. But we sat out on their first floor patio right next to the water. We soon forgot about not being able to sit on the roof, although there is a cover over the entire back patio, so you won't be getting much color on nice summer afternoons. But the view is great and you feel like you are on vacation with the boats flying by and docking up to come in for a bite to eat. We ordered some of the specialty drinks and although they are pricey they are VERY tasty (I highly suggest the summer snow or any of the sangria choices they were all phenomenal!!). \u00a0We ordered our lunch options and they were all fine. The only mistake the waitress made was she forgot our calamari appetizer, but brought it during our meal and it was not a big deal at all. I will admit for being SO dead the service was a little slow, but not unbearable. It was a summer afternoon, so we were pretty laid back and parked up for the afternoon. Our waitress was more than accommodating, we asked her if we could see the roof since that's where we wanted to sit originally and she walked us right up there and took our picture. I have to say I would defiantly go back to enjoy a few of their specialty cocktails on that roof! The furniture and decor would remind you of a club in Miami or Vegas. The cushions were bright orange with white trim, eye catching but still elegant. \u00a0The view is very pretty as long as you do not walk to close to the parking lot side. That side looks more like a construction zone as I would assume that areas is still up and coming. Unfortunately for them that side is where the city sky line is, makes for a pretty picture just make sure you stay far enough from ledge. The parking and taxi situation I can imagine would be a huge issue. We drove because it was a Sunday afternoon and we were not planning to drink to heavily. But if it were a Friday or Saturday night it would have been a different story. The parking lot is pretty big, but not big enough if the club was full. My suggestion would be to use UBER. They come on demand and with this location being very secluded (not many businesses and certainly no other bars surrounding it) taxis probably don't come that far off the beaten trail .....

I want to like this place, because it's really close to where I live, and there aren't too many bars along the elston corridor. I think they are aiming for a crowd that is coming in from the suburbs, not locals, for a few reasons:- the location is not convenient to straightforward transportation - you have to take a cab or drive- there's a lot of effort put into valet service and space for parking (good idea when you're drinking at a bar, huh?)- the strict dress-code doesn't lend itself to someone walking down the block to get lunch or a drink - at all hours, not just eveningsI feel the food is overpriced and not of great quality. With so many places upping their game for fancy cocktails, the drink list here really leaves something to be desired. It took a long time to get our food and drinks, for it not being too special.For the nighttime scene, it's too much pomp for not pulling big name DJs. I'll put up with dress codes, crap service for bad drinks if they get awesome people to play, but they don't.*The dress code thing: first time - bad on me - I didn't know you wanted to keep it super dressy. Second time, it was because my friend was wearing leather strappy sandals. They said dudes can't wear sandals. It was in the afternoon before the Bears game and we were just trying to get some drinks and something to drink.

It happens even less often that I want a sub for dinner.Last Saturday, both of these rare phenomena did indeed occur, and this is where Vinnie's delivered. Well, not delivered as in \"brought to my house,\" but delivered as in \"filled the void\" and \"hit a home run.\"After it was deemed that I wasn't cooking, I decided to pick up some viddles for dinner, make some tasty cocktails, and have an impromptu picnic across the street from my house. I headed to Vinnie's after I remembered reading such glowing reviews. This unassuming little sandwich shop on Grand Avenue is fantastic. There's a huge variety of subs, available in two sizes: a nine inch or a twelve inch. Unless you're ravenous, a nine inch should suffice. There's plenty of options--all kinds of meats and cheeses, and lots of choices for vegetarians as well.In order to try as many as possible, I asked for a tuna salad, smoked turkey/provolone, and a 'capri,' which had fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Sandwiches are made fresh to order (obviously) and can be customized with the de-rigeur toppings of lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar, onion, pickles, mustard/mayo, and seasonings. And for a small upcharge, they have premium add-ons like artichoke hearts, eggplant, or pesto mayo.And because my fianc\u00e9 feels that no picnic is complete without potato salad, I grabbed a side of that as well. I was on my way in no time. Three nine-inch subs and the potato salad came in at around $17. Wow, that may be the least amount I've ever spent on food for a picnic. The highest price here for a sandwich is only $6.75, and that's for a twelve incher. You can't even buy the ingredients at the grocery store to make one for less money. This is cheap eats heaven!But of course, cheap means nothing if the food's not good, and this food was GREAT. Super-fresh ingredients, perfectly crusty bread, and just the right amount of well-balanced fillings. I also liked that they didn't use a heavy hand with the condiments. These sandwiches were damn near ideal.The potato salad on the other hand, was forgettable. I'd bet a million dollars it came from a five-gallon drum; completely mediocre and not worth the calories.

The sashimi display was beautiful-very appealing. The fish itself was nice and cold and sooooo fresh!! I cannot stress how fresh the fish was. The platter also came with a bowl of rice, which was really soft and fluffy, which was a nice addition to the array of fish slices. The signature maki was soooo good. I like how the chef rolled them and the size that he cut each roll. Everyone in our party received a bowl of miso soup, which was more flavorful than I've had, and it was even tipped with peppers, which I've never seen anywhere before.

It was sushi, but prepared unlike any sushi that I have had before. This was a dish of crispy sushi rice atop ebi tempura. There was a honey mayonnaise in the recipe that gave the sushi a pop that I enjoyed without use of soy sauce. The interesting maki roll was the Spooky Maki. This sushi roll was made of unagi, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro served with a spicy mayonnaise and unagi sauce. The unagi sauce was rather sweet. After patting much of the unagi sauce on the plate, the sushi pieces were delicious.While the sushi definitely is a highlight, the service seems a bit disconnected.

It is apparent though that none of the people there (and perhaps the owner too) know much about solid business practices. Claiming that this is \"the law\", but not being able to elaborate further on that, they insist on taking a photocopy of your driver's license, which contains a lot of private information. True, you're entering a contract and signing a liability waiver, but beyond verifying the information on your DL no law to my knowledge stipulates that they need to keep a copy of it. And... I wouldn't actually have \u00a0had much issue with it, had it not been for the fact that the young receptionist who looked like life had been very unkind to her, was leaving some of the signed contracts just lying around. And those that she had \"put away\" were kept unlocked, in a cabinet right behind a counter which at least half of the time was unattended. Honestly, if I wanted to i could have walked away with a few contracts and the personal information of the people who had signed it.. \u00a0So, naturally, I questioned them, and that's when \u00a0they became very combative and rude.

I tried de-escalating the situation that was about to get out of hands, by explaining again, calmly, what my concern was, but they really didn't care, and the dude I was talking to asked me to leave. It's ironic that in their site they prominently claim to take customers safety and privacy seriously. If only wishing made it so!

She even commented that it didn't hurt very much. \u00a0Nonetheless, in the 5 minutes between the first and second piercing, she inexplicably (to a non-six-year-old) started to lose her nerve. \u00a0She has the lip quivering and the tears welling, and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, this might be a one-ear situation.\" Bob then (with some limited help from us) TOTALLY \"talked her off the ledge.\" \u00a0The second piercing was done, and she was smiling at her new \"big-girl\" look in the mirror a minute later. \u00a0When my ex asked for a picture of my newly-pierced kid with Bob, he went a step further and took her into the photo booth in the front of the place for a round of great, silly, pics with him. \u00a0Truly an awesome memory for me, her mom, and most importantly, my girl!

I have always recommended my friends to go to Insight because they are the cleanest, friendliest, and most talented shop that I have come by.

Next, in no way was anyone combative and rude to the man. He kept saying the same thing over and over again, and when he became very frustrated and rude to the shop workers, he twisted their own words and said that they did not give a fuck about his needs, when it was the exact opposite. At the end he was making a huge scene and was asked politely to leave and kept saying, so you want me to leave because you do not care about my needs, which was not what was being said.

His lines are straight-- something that I hear every time people see one of my tattoos-- and his ink has stayed darker than my others. I am going to insight in a week to get a larger piece done by him, and I cannot wait!!Piercings--Santi did my septum. When he first pierced it, it wasn't in the center of the sweet spot, so hours later it was already moving. I quickly found him on Facebook, and shot him a message with a photo attached of my moving septum. Without hesitation, he told me to pop back in at any time, even if it was after closing time. I came later that night, and instead of trying to maneuver the piercing (it could have been due to swelling), he just pierced it again higher up. I haven't had any problems with it since! Santi is also a super cool dude. And who could forget Bob Jones. That dude is awesome. He pierced my nostril for me first. I honesty didn't feel a thing when the needle went in. When my nostril started having a bubble next to it (something that happened the last time I got my nose pierced), he immediately got back to me and told me how to care for it, telling me not to worry. Bob also pierced one of my nipples. I was NERVOUS, to put it loosely. People told me how much the clamp hurt- even before the needle went through. He told me it really isn't anything to worry about, that it'll be done in a second. Before we even pierced, Bob made me feel super comfortable- I mean, I had to take my entire shirt off and have him touch my boob.

I called ahead to see if my friend and I could get tattoos at the same time - or if an appointment was needed. I was told someone was open if we could come right away - so my friend & I got to the shop within 10 mins... but still waited well over an hour. The studio itself is really nice, very clean and bright. The super cute blonde girl working the reception area was very friendly and beyond helpful. She was just plain awesome. The receptionist explained to us and other walk in customers that the artists do everything \"custom\" so it was great to just come in with an idea and the artist would draw something up. Of course they had pictures of work they had done, but there was no typical \"samples on the wall\" set up like most shops. My friend and I were getting similar tattoos - very simple 5 word phrases in black ink. We were given an iPad with a program to view the different fonts. We each picked out what we liked and were told to email a screen shot so the artist would have it for reference, which we did. When it was finally our turn we were assigned to Johnny and the samples he brought to us were NOT the fonts we had selected. No big deal, they would reprint them. Then when I asked if my phrase could be made into a circle rather than just a straight line, he said \"You'd have to bring the picture in that way, I don't know how to do it.\" This baffled me, because they're supposed to do \"custom\" work. I didn't understand what was difficult about putting my words into a circle.. but was glad he didn't agree to do something he could have possibly done wrong. So I agreed. He then told us there was a problem with my font uploading in their system (or something like that.) I told him we used the program THEY supplied us.. but he insisted it wasn't working on their side. I reminded him we emailed pictures of the phrases/fonts we wanted - and asked him to print it out that way. After 3 or 4 trips back and forth - he was finally able to do it for us. However, even after I sat down in the chair and we had gone over my selection several times he STILL had the wrong tattoo printed out for me. (At that point, I really almost walked out.) We were able to eventually iron out all the kinks and get things going... When my boyfriend and my friend followed me to his booth he said \"oh, you can only have one person with you.\" I pointed out that the people in the booth next to him had 3 in their group, as well. His response was, \"well.. they know the owner.\" (Really?!?) So my friend returned to the lobby area. Ugh.Beyond the confusion, Johnny was very nice and professional. It was my first tattoo and he definitely made me feel comfortable and explained everything he was doing step by step. He asked me several times if I was doing ok, if I felt alright, etc. \u00a0He also took plenty of time to make sure I knew how to properly care for my tattoo at home.My simple black 5 word tattoo costed $100 which I felt was a bit pricey but not surprising for the trendy area. You get $10 off if you check in on Yelp. I didn't learn the cost until 2 seconds before he started and after waiting for 90 minutes I couldn't convince myself to back out. I am confident I could have gotten the same tattoo of the same quality at a different shop for a few bucks less. (To add a bit of insult to injury, once I got home and REALLY looked at it, I noticed a flaw in one of the letters.. which I am sure nobody else will notice, but it will definitely drive me nuts for the rest of my life.)All in all, not a terrible experience but I unfortunately will probably NOT return to this shop for my next tat.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 9, 8]}, "14": {"description": "I go here for Johnny!

The main floor is mostly furniture and household decor. They do have some quality stuff, but also at quality prices. Sofas and desks are at least $200. I also saw them selling 5 place settings of china at $20 - $30, and many cup and saucer sets at $10.50. C'mon, at these prices I could have gotten brand new china on sale. The basement, or the bric-a-brac floor, is where I usually spend the most of my time since I collect china. Even though they mark up a lot of their stuff, the person setting the prices is definitely not an expert and usually marks up nice looking at first glance but in fact mediocre to poor quality items, especially they are sets.

(Pause ... still pausing)The service, much like at Simply Thalia, was inviting. They had lychee juice, so that was a good beverage option. The ginger chicken soup reminded me of tom yum gai (chicken). That was the highlight and a soup option I would gladly indulge during the cold months in Chicago. Where it all fell apart was with the Indian chicken makhani. Indian food is my favourite ethnic cuisine and that means I have a tendency to be more critical of said cuisine because I love it so much. As wonderful as the presentation was, the dish failed in terms of flavour. The average American may find the chicken makhani to be very appetizing. However, having a palate that is accustomed to a bloom of rich flavours, I cannot cosign that the dish would satisfy those who love spices.Thalia Spice seems to cover the gambit of Asian cuisines. That could be both good and bad. It's good from the standpoint that a patron can have one-stop options for their dining experience. It's bad from the standpoint that something gets compromised and shortcuts get introduced into the cooking at times.

(Pause ... still pausing)The service, much like at Simply Thalia, was inviting. They had lychee juice, so that was a good beverage option. The ginger chicken soup reminded me of tom yum gai (chicken). That was the highlight and a soup option I would gladly indulge during the cold months in Chicago. Where it all fell apart was with the Indian chicken makhani. Indian food is my favourite ethnic cuisine and that means I have a tendency to be more critical of said cuisine because I love it so much. As wonderful as the presentation was, the dish failed in terms of flavour. The average American may find the chicken makhani to be very appetizing. However, having a palate that is accustomed to a bloom of rich flavours, I cannot cosign that the dish would satisfy those who love spices.Thalia Spice seems to cover the gambit of Asian cuisines. That could be both good and bad. It's good from the standpoint that a patron can have one-stop options for their dining experience. It's bad from the standpoint that something gets compromised and shortcuts get introduced into the cooking at times.

It comes with rice, but I substituted it w/ the naan. The menu calls it naan (Indian paratha), but it was more like Malaysian roti. I think they should clear that up on their menu...naan and paratha are two different types of breads. Sorry for that side note. Anywho, the curry was decent. Good amount of spice. My only gripe is that the \"naan\" that I ordered (mind you there is an upcharge) was so tiny for the massive amount of curry they served. My \"naan\" was finished in a few bites and is nowhere the size of a \"real\" naan bread. So, skip that upcharge and stick to the rice! We didn't order dessert. Service was decent. They forgot a couple of our friends' meals. That always annoys me and shouldn't be a mistake that is made in restaurants! And my \"naan\" came out about 10 minutes after my curry.

The scallops were tough to get down, so I left a lot of them uneaten. They were a bit dry and gummy, and the taste was very fishy. You'd think the salad would be better, perhaps able to disguise the scallops' taste. But no. The avocado was OK, but the tomatoes used in it (surprise guest...but I like tomatoes so it was OK) were a bit mealy. And the mango chunks themselves were slimy and well past their prime.

After searching thoroughly, the owner apologized and said the bartender must have mistakenly given to someone else.

She also gave me her personal number and told me to call her first thing in the morning to follow up, so that she'd know that everything had worked out. I called the next morning as requested at what I thought was a reasonable time, I think around 11, and she acted as though I was bothering her ... I told her that I was able to cancel my card.

Of course I replied no thank you, because as I told her during our previous phone conversation I'd canceled the card, so it was of no use to me. My friend nonetheless decided to host her party there. I attended her party and walked in prepared to pay cash, just in case. I brought a friend with me, and we ordered drinks which were made well. My friend asked someone working behind the bar to borrow an ink pen. Unbeknownst to him, he was talking to the owner who told him that one of the servers would have a pen, and then walked away.

Unfortunately I cannot. \u00a0I had high hopes for MVie. I recommend the owners focus on being an intimate place for specialty drinks, music ie Jazz and offer small plates and awesome desserts. The appetizers were much better than the entrees. Quick Summary: A quite, obscure and intimate place on the near west wide that serves over priced food and drinks.Details:It's extremely easy to miss because the restaurant does not have an type of signage. It's right next door to Bella Note. There is a beautiful wooden door and an ATM machine outside; I found the ATM machine a bit peculiar because I didn't know if this meant the restaurant didn't accept credit cards.I opened the \u00a0wooden door and still no signage to indicate I was at the right place. I was meeting my dear friend for dinner and drinks. The main door opens up to a small space and a large dark curtain that you open up to a glass door. I open the glass door and was pleasantly surprised to see tables and a dimly lit room with a bar. I was warmly greeted by a hostess at a wooden podium right next to the door. Again, I found the placement of the podium oddly placed because the dining space is very small. Nevertheless, I immediately saw my girlfriend and sat down to white table cloth service. Service: Our waiter was friendly and attentive throughout the night and tried very hard to make sure we were having a good time.Drinks:It took a long time for the bartender to make our drinks. There were only 8 people in that night that's including the staff. So, it wasn't busy and not everyone was ordering drinks. Our drinks came out separately. You never serve drinks separately. There was another long wait before my friend's drink was served. Did they distill the alcohol to order? I had a pomegranate margarita strong ;0) and tasty. My girlfriend seemed to enjoy her fruity martini.Was it worth the wait? No. Nothing impressive or to rave about. Bread:Served 2 mini croissants. Cold and semi dried out mini croissants served with butter. Marianos and Costco make fresh and tasty croissants at a reasonable price. Appetizers:We tried the fried green tomatoes and fried chili shrimp.We were served approximately 6 fried green tomatoes that were covered in shredded iceberg lettuce for a garnish. Why iceberg lettuce as a garnish?! Don't know.The green tomatoes were crispy on the outside and firm on the inside and not greasy.We were served 4 large shrimp. Crispy and hot drizzled with a sweet chili sauce on top. It reminded me of the sweet chili sauce you can buy at the grocery store.Dinner:Unfortunately we came the day (Saturday at 6:30 pm) when \"pork chops were on back order and only 2 ribeyes were left.\" We regrouped and decided to order the blackened chicken and the \"special\" baked chicken. The waiter recommended the baked chicken because he personally tried it for lunch earlier that day and loved it. My girlfriend didn't like the blackened chicken fillet and mashed sweet potatoes. It was a thin flattened chicken breast fillet with Lowry's seasoning salt on it. She ordered an arugula salad that had currants, green apple slices, and mound of blue cheese on top. My \"special\" baked chicken with gravy on the side was shockingly dry. Did I get a portion of the same baked chicken my waiter ate earlier that day for lunch. That's the only way to dry out a baked chicken by keeping it in the oven. For $23.00, I was served a dried out small leg and a very small thigh. If it were any smaller it could be called a Cornish hen and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest bit. I was absolutely shocked. I've never been served such a small portion of chicken in a restaurant. Typically a dark meat never dries out during the baking process. but somehow MVies chef succeeded to dry out a little leg and thigh. There was absolutely no flavor or semblance of seasoning. Thankfully, I substituted the rice with an order or mashed potatoes but had to pay extra $6.00. That was the only highlight of the dish but the mashed potatoes were overly worked and not light. Did I was served a dollop of mash? Lastly, my meal came with a petite salad with balsamic dressing. Here's my problem...it was a cold iceberg salad similar to what you'll find at the grocery store...the pre-made Dole salad bags. The so called balsamic salad dressing was just italian dressing that you'd purchase at the grocery store too. balsamic dressing is brown in color this was creamy white. It appears the chef's only speciality is knowing how to fry food. :0/ Background music:Loud 90s r&b slow jams. So disappointed. $114.00 between two people should provide good food and excellent drinks.Overall, the two stars are for the waiter's attentiveness and attempt to make us feel comfortable throughout the night; and the interior decor.

I am a stickler for cakes.. they have to LOOK and TASTE amazing and Lovely always delivers on both of those aspects. Most recently I contacted Trisha over at Lovely to design my friend's baby shower cake. I sent her a few images I had found on the net of designs I liked and we collaborated and discussed via emailed exactly what I wanted. She was friendly and super helpful. They make their cakes at a specific location but had it delivered to the location on Milwaukee for pick up on my request - which is closer to me - and I found that to be a shining example of amazing customer service.What I got is better than I ever could have envisioned! (Hopefully I can get an image of the cake on here soon via my yelp app.) I ordered an all white vanilla cake with little fondant baby boy blue shoes on top, yellow, blue, and green fondant flat circles sporadically on top and around the cake, and a little blue and white cameo with a little boy designed on it placed on the front side and the cake was finally rimmed at the bottom with little white fondant balls. Everyone at the baby shower, especially the Mom to be, was floored by how beautiful the cake was and we all didn't even want to cut into it and wreck it!!

I sent her a few images I had found on the net of designs I liked and we collaborated and discussed via emailed exactly what I wanted. She was friendly and super helpful.

(Hopefully I can get an image of the cake on here soon via my yelp app.) I ordered an all white vanilla cake with little fondant baby boy blue shoes on top, yellow, blue, and green fondant flat circles sporadically on top and around the cake, and a little blue and white cameo with a little boy designed on it placed on the front side and the cake was finally rimmed at the bottom with little white fondant balls.

Jerk chicken, Jerk fries, a veggie patty (...I don't know why anyone would go to get a veggie patty, but I'm sure it's probably delicious), and a few dessert options. The Jerk chicken comes in a square container on top of a nice thick piece of Texas Toast. The portion is definitely enough for two servings, but since I'm a Jerk chicken addict, I usually eat the whole thing. A delicious little hush puppy comes inside your Jerk package of heaven. Make sure you try the Rude Girl sauce, your taste buds will be happy you did. BUT, if your sensitive to heat, I'd go with the BBQ sauce instead. The Jerk fries are spicy seasoned fries and you get a huge portion of them.

Brace yourselves, this post is long. Anywho, while I was in the middle of doing a 20 block walk as punishment for eating a cupcake, I realized that I got food poisoning from my favorite fast food Asian joint that rhymes with bow wao. I was at the point where I couldn't trust a fart so getting to a bathroom was mandatory. I was starting to freak out because I was around that super industrial area on Halsted Ave but I saw Jerk and felt a tad bit relieved.I'm one of those weird people who can't go to a restaurant's public restroom without buying something because I hate conflict and honestly wouldn't know how to react if an employee told me \"No.\" *Restrooms should be open to the public but that's another story for another day.* I follow Jerk on twitter and they seemed appetizing so I decided to grab an entree to go for later or to share if I was feeling charitable.  I chose the pork *oink oink*, sweet plantain, festival, slaw, and ciltantro lime aioli (THAT SAUCE SHOULD'VE BEEN A RED FLAG BUT WHATEVS). I proceeded to calmly ask where the restroom was even though it felt like I was about to explode & there was a tumultuous war going on in my innards. When I was finished in the restroom, my food was packaged and ready to go. Cool. Or so I thought.I arrived home, excited as all get down to consume my food. However, what I tasted made all dead Jamaicans roll around in their graves. EVERYTHING WAS DRYER THAN OPRAH'S PHONE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. I have no idea why this place claims to serve jerk....maybe the grilling preparation? Idk. The meat had NO seasoning. None. Ningun. I had to use my own seasoning and some SWEET BABY RAYS to give it some flavor. WHAT??! PREPOSTEROUS. The slaw was the only decent thing, WHICH IS SAD IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE DELICIOUSNESS THAT IS JERK. I instantly wanted my $11 back but I live in the burbs and I'm sure that a company that serves tasteless jerk meat doesn't give a damn if you like it or not.

I've tried all the best Jerk Spots throughout the City (Jerk Villa being the best) and even been to Jamaica 6 times for the authentic Jerk Jamaican Food experience. I'm such a fan, that at times I make my own marinade, spark up my own grill, and make own Jerk! :)The other day I was having a Jerk craving. I figured since this new restaurant Jerk Grill was by my place of employment me and a co-worker will give em a try.When I 1st stepped in I saw all hispanics and white people behind the counter working. Mind you this is advertised as \"Authentic Jamaican Jerk\". For a sec I stepped outside because I thought I entered the wrong restaurant (Chipotle maybe?). But I saw the sign on the window and I guessed I was in right place.But then I thought possibly, maybe they're Jamaican but just don't look it. So then I stepped up to order and said \"Wah Gwaan\", the guy at the counter looked dumbfounded like I was speaking a foreign language. He didn't comprehend a basic Jamaican Greeting (This is a Jamaican Restaurant right?). We joked it off and proceeded with the order.I ordered a Jerk Chicken entree and my Co-worker ordered some Jerk Wings. Now, I've been eating Jerk for a VERY long time, been to some of the best Jerk spots to some of the worst but this is the 1st time I ever got \"slits\" of what he said was boneless skinless chicken. The counter guy went as far as to put the few slits of chicken on a scale (which was annoying). He deducted what I thought should be on the platter. Serious red flags are ablazed!Authentic Jerk Chicken is usually a couple quarter chickens chopped with a cleaver. I slid down the counter and got Rice n Beans as a side and was more throwed back when the other hispanic guy gave me a mere scoop of it. At this point I knew that I wasn't in an Authentic Jamaican Food Restaurant. (Looks like Chipotle Mexican Grill employees).I looked at the total for the entree along with Soda and then looked at what I was getting. I couldn't help but to look at my co-worker and laugh as we both shared an unspoken joke.To make a long story short we go to the table and just as I thought the jokes were about to end. They bring my co-worker his 6-wings. Lo and behold, there not whole wings. They're pieces of a wing. Jokes and Laughter continues!The only good thing we spoke about this place is the decor. Clean as a whistle with good jamaican music playing.The sauce \"Rudegirl\" wasn't bad. I actually tasted the Allspice, Thyme Leaves, and Habaneros. My Co-Worker gave me a drum from his 6-wings and the rub was quite tasty. Makes me wonder if they learned from youtube video's how to make it.I just don't understand why I didn't see any Jamaicans or Black People in a supposedly \"Authentic Jamaican Restaurant\". The servers and even Cooks were all Non Jamaicans.When I go to Chinese spots, I'm served by Chinese People. When I eat Mexican Food, I'm served by Mexicans, When I eat Greek food I'm served by Greeks. When I eat African Food, well you get the picture...Based off this experience I won't be back.

As a tag-along one fine Thursday, I was introduced to the sweat-inducing magic of the Rude Girl chicken with seasoned fries. Their Chicago & Halsted shop was hotly anticipated since and thanks to Yelp, the boy and I trekked over on a rainy evening. LINE OUT THE DOOR!I'd liken the dining experience to that of \"Green Streets Smoked Meats\". There's a fully outfitted bar that's separate from the food counter. You pick a meat and the guy behind the counter slices, dices, then weighs the portions. He'll plop it onto a tray and slide it down the line for choice of sides (island slaw included), a sauce, plus any extras. Their shop has expanded choices of sides such as salted potatoes, coconut black bean rice, and mac-n-cheese. Plus you can enjoy their meats as sliders, on top of salads with other extras like yuca fries and beef/veggie patties. The chicken was just as magical as I remembered. The boy got the Rude Girl, but I decided to give my bowels a rest and try their Jerk BBQ sauce. If you're not willing to sweat it out, their BBQ sauce is a safe bet. There's also an aioli as a third option. After trying the coconut rice and mac-n-cheese, my favorite's always the tried-and-true seasoned fries. Even though it's an extra, this is a must-order!Since Jerk's been open for less than a week, I expected some bumps. The staff was still figuring out their rhythm amongst the dinner rush. When ordering an extra, like fries, they hand you a tiny laminated label that sits on your tray after you pay and sit down. We were confused if we were supposed to check-in and pick it up at the register or if someone was to bring it out to us. Eventually someone did track us down with our fries.

When I first moved to Chicago, it was extremely difficult to find a place that provided authentic Caribbean/Jamaican food. I saw the signs for months and couldn't wait for this place to open after having the jerk chicken from the food truck.This place nails it! EVERYTHING is on point! From the friendly staff, to the atmosphere, the food and last but not least, the drinks make you feel like you're on the beach in Jamaica or many miles away in a tropical paradise.I've read some reviews that mention that its \"not authentic\" jerk. Had they taken the time to read the entire name of the restaurant -- they would have noticed the words \"Modern Jamaican Grill\"! Meanwhile, coming from Caribbean roots, I can authentically say that Jerk is DOING the damn thing and they're doing it right!! No, you won't find ox-tail, brow stew chicken, or \"manish wata\"-- but what you will find is authentically jerk seasoned boneless, skinless chicken breast, pork, and beef - all grilled and/or smoked to perfection. The sides are just as authentic with options that include: plantains, seasoned mac & cheese, coconut rice/peas and cilantro corn.In addition, other offerings include seasoned Yuca fries which offer crunchier and better health benefits over traditional french fries (which are also fantastic), sliders, probably the best wings Chicago has to offer (Jerk chicken wings). For all you vegetarians out there - I'm pleased to announce that they offer veggie patties, salads and island slaw for you as well!Do not forget to visit the bar and order my favorite - RUM PUNCH! There are so many other options available too. Every bartender is super friendly and very attentive (even when busy).Sauces are on point. Rude girl is a favorite, but, if you are looking for that extra \"kick\" try the \"Rude Boy\" sauce. I promise to all those who think the chicken isn't spicy enough, you'd be begging for some rum punch to wash it down with. ;)In a nutshell, Jerk is a modern twist to traditional Jamaican/Caribbean barbecue and offers its customers a 'fast-casual' type of ordering. But if you stay and sit at the bar or at a table, you'll soak up the island vibe and quickly forget you're in the hustle & bustle of the city.Check it out, you have nothing to lose!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 8, 28]}, "41": {"description": "The first time I came here I got the wings.

I was really stalking the restaurant opening for one reason and one reason only - Jamaican Meat Patties!!! After eating a dozen or so meat patties on a vacation to Jamaica I simply could not get them off my mind. A year or two later the Jerk food truck started showing up at my place of employment and to my delight they had meat patties that did not disappoint. Flaky, buttery crust and spicy beef filling just like the ones I had in Jamaica! Fast forward, a year when I'm working at a new place with no access to the Jerk truck and desperately craving a meat patty. Needless to say, I was SUPER excited when Jerk finally opened.I think it would be a fair statement that you probably don't want to eat here if you're not into the spices. Almost everything on the menu packs a pretty solid punch of spice. While dining in with a friend we had the jerk pork and jerk chicken both of which came with a hush puppy (although I don't believe that is their name for it), cole slaw, and a side of your choice. We both chose mac and cheese. And of course, I also got a beef patty on the side. The beef patty was phenomenal (but I knew that already). Both of the meats were excellent, moist and full of flavor. All of the sides were fantastic as well. The mac and cheese is super cheesy and delightful and has that kicked up spice that Jerk Modern Jamaican Grill does so well. Obviously I'll be back to eat ALLLLL the meat patties but after sampling the meats I think it's quite clear to me that I'll be loading up on the jerk proteins too.

We also ordered the ikebukuro, oyako don, and hamachi jalapeno.The nigiri was whatever, the uni and fish weren't as fresh as I expected. I would not order to foie gras again, despite my love for it, but as a nigiri it was just way too rich and buttery to take down on its own. The amaebi was a bit mushier than what I prefer.

I would recommend two things we had: the hotate aburi and the ikebukuro. Those two were pretty good, the best out of our meal.Prices were expensive though, in my opinion. about $3-4 per piece of sashimi/nigiri. I'm used to it being 2 pieces per order. And for that price, I expected something very fresh and high quality.They also only had 3 orders of uni left?! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!

He broke it down and even offered to throw in a sample of some nutrients to try if I came in!!! There are a bazillion grow shops in Chicago and I would recommend Urban Grower to anyone.

Flo was recommended by a regular at a favorite coffee shop as a great brunch spot, and my boyfriend, who used to live in the area over 5 years ago, did not realize it was still around so we made are way to the restaurant.Can I just say I love bars/restaurants that primarily play mid-2000s indie rock? Because I do. Everything on their playlist were bands I regularly listen to (because I am stuck in college, apparently) and really set a hip, comfortable vibe. Giant abstract artwork in earth tones with ripped and restitched canvas covered the dining room and added to the hip atmosphere. Everything was very warm and inviting. My boyfriend recognized a few of the servers from 5 years ago - always a good sign.Our server, Omar, was attentive but not overly so and was very friendly and made great recommendations. Brought out chips immediately and got our drink and food orders out fast. Ordered a cholula bloody mary and was pretty excited about it - but it was watery and mostly tasted like weak non-cholula hot sauce and mezcal. Could have been more savory and was ultimately the biggest disappointment. Coffee was great, but I didn't get the chance to ask what they were serving. I got green chile chicken enchiladas with a fried egg and extra hatch chile BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED that it was on the menu as a southwesterner who has yet to see it on a menu in the midwest. Chicken was juicy and spicy, green sauce had a great char to it, and the egg on top was the perfect touch. Boyfriend got mole chilaquiles, which was the special on that day. Mole sauce was not overly chocolatey in textrue like it traditionally is, but it worked well with the chips and definitely as chilaquiles. I admit that I may have heavily suggested that he order it, and I wish we had split them down the middle! These dishes were both served with black beans and brown rice, rice was great but I wish the beans had been refried.We arrived a bit later for brunch and while they were obviously setting the dining room for dinner service, we didn't feel rushed or ignored at all.

I was pretty nervous about getting a perm since all I know about perms is based on bad 80s hairstyles, but I knew I wanted to do something with my fine, limp hair. Epoch was the only salon I could find in Chicago that seemed to have any real experience doing perms, so I figured I would give it a shot.Beth was extremely knowledgeable about the process and really took the time to explain it to me and go through all of my options. I had no idea there were so many ways to do a perm, but together we decided on the best option for my hair. The process itself was easy and only took about 2 hours and the results so far are great - definitely not the bad 80s curls I was picturing from a perm and it's the first time in my life that my hair has any body or texture on its own. My hair turned out semi-curly/wavy, and has way more body than it used to - now I'm just trying to learn how to actually work with curly hair since I've never needed to before. Beth did a great job and I'm sure I will be returning once the perm grows out.The perm was a bit pricier than at other salons, but for a service like this where it could go horribly wrong if the stylist doesn't know what they're doing, I am happy to pay for the extra expertise. Their haircuts and other services though are right in line with other Chicago prices, so it pretty much all evens out anyways.Also, a lot of people seem to have a problem with the information form you have to fill out, which I don't really understand. I thought it was great that the salon wanted to be fully informed before doing any work on my hair, and Beth went through all of the information on the form with me.

If you want to stop reading here, then can summarize this review by saying that I 100% recommend Epoch Bridal for weddings and Epoch Salon for anything else! But if you have some time... I booked Epoch to do hair and makeup for myself, my bridesmaids and a few close family members for my wedding in July and I was beyond thrilled with the results! Zee did our hair, Susan did our makeup and Stephanie coordinated the whole process.I am not someone who has my hair and makeup done often, so my main concern going into my wedding was wanting to look like me. \u00a0I let Zee (hair) and Susan (makeup) know this, brought along a few photos of what I was looking for, and they delivered EXACTLY what I wanted. I can honestly say that I have never felt as beautiful as I did on my wedding day.From the first time I reached out to Stephanie to set up my Epoch Bridal appointment she was extremely helpful and patient answering all of my (sometimes ridiculous) questions - believe me, there were a lot. When I was hesitant to book trial appointments because of cost (Epoch is pricey but WELL worth it) she asked me to send her some pictures of what I had in mind so she could pass them along to Zee and Susan to get their opinions. \u00a0A day or so later Stephanie assured me that, although she always recommends having the trials, if I wanted to forego them to save on cost both Zee and Susan were confident that they could recreate the look I wanted. In the end I ended up skipping the trials and was 100% thrilled with how both my hair and makeup turned out. \u00a0I will say that I had a fairly simple vision for both my hair and makeup, so it worked out great for me but if you are wanting something more complicated you should probably go for the trial sessions to be sure everyone is on the same page with what you want.The day of my wedding Zee and Susan showed up to my bridal suite on time and ready to get started. \u00a0They were both very nice and very professional, while still managing to be really fun to work with (not something everyone can pull off)! They chatted with everyone and put us all at ease right away. \u00a0With all the stress of the wedding day, it was so nice to be able to have some time to relax and get pampered. \u00a0Best of all, when they were finished I didn't feel like some overly made-up, cookie cutter bride - I felt like myself (okay, definitely a prettier, more polished version of myself - but you know what I mean!).I completely recommend the team at Epoch Bridal to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a standard 'Bridal' hair and makeup experience.

After that first appointment I did request for Beth, but for some reason they wouldn't let me book with her so I went back to Crystal and decided to give this salon another shot based on all the good reviews.

At my last appointment there I went with her suggestion and got balayage for a second time, but when I seen the end result it had looked like I had nothing done to it. I had grown out my hair for about two months after the first balyage, because I was told that you didn't need to touch it up as often. You can imagine my shock when I do that and get a touch up that has a couple blonde strands and that's it. I understand that balayage isn't like highlights but as I seen from the other salon I now go to it is more than a couple thin strands. I had my dark roots that was down to my ears with thin strips of blonde in it and ended up paying what I felt was a ridiculous amount for hair that didn't even look like anything was done to it.

The Hideout is just one of those cool venues you wish you and your friends owned. I could spend a lot of time at a place like this.Eclectic booking policy that works for a change. It's part of what makes The Hideout, well, The Hideout. Add to that the oddball location, a fantastic front room bar, and a separate music venue in back and you have all the ingredients for a good night out.If you're on the road and this is your first time here, you might be a bit taken aback. It's located in an industrial area, and to find an old house / bar / venue is a bit puzzling, but no worries. The Hideout has a loyal following, and deservedly so. I've found it to be very performer-focused, so whatever you're doing you'll be treated well by the staff and crowd.Load in through the alley behind the venue to the north. It's just a quick trip from the door to the stage. You'll probably have to stash gear along one of the walls or in front after you check. There's no backstage area. Once that's over, park your car on street and head back in to the bar, grab a seat and order a drink, they'll take care of the rest.It's a small room, and I'd guess sound can be hit or miss, it really depends on how loud you are on stage.

A bit noisy, but it was only about half-full, so conversation was possible.SERVICE: Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

My rabbit casoncelli was rich and nicely plated. My companion's special black truffle pappardelle was also delicious. Sage brown butter sauce was nicely brown -- not just melted butter as in some places. Seasoning balance was very good, and not over-salted. Escarole salad with arugula pesto vinaigrette was loaded with goodies (bacon, walnuts, beets) and so yummy.

It's fantastic and worth all five of the stars I'm attributing to it. Under what criteria am I deciding them five star worthy you ask? I'm reviewing them on the basis of decor, selection, service, and price. Dovetail inhabits a an open, airy space, with a big picture window, and carefully edited racks of clothing along the left and right walls and well preserved mid-century furniture and accessories bisecting the room. The decor is visually interesting and provides multiple anchor areas full of color and pattern that coincide with the arrangement of merchandise. That's a plus and a nuance that I've see in few boutiques in Chicago. And if it's neglected in high end boutiques to say it's been overlooked in most vintage stores is an understatement. Dovetail operates in a rarefied strata on their decor. Onward. Dovetails is again rarefied in its careful attention to selecting pieces that won't be found just anywhere. In this respect, it's in the company of Silver Moon, which is another place where you just know, you have the only piece still extant and in good condition. Unlike Silver Moon, you have a larger selection of unique pieces that are actually wearable in different situations. Believe me I'm still wearing the cream knee length halter dress with gold embroidery that I bought from Dovetail, but not the periwinkle petticoat I got from SM. Now I have to admit here, that I'm not the hippest, coolest, super tiny hipster to ever to exist. In fact, I'm a documented non hipster; I mock mercilessly. I've never been to Pitchfork. I don't wear odd pieces layered on one another and no I've never lived in Wicker Park. I hold down a job in Internet Sales, am a solid size 8, and know I have some of the lamest, friends around since we drink non ironic labels of beer, host dinner parties, garden, and watch baseball games. The reason you must know all of this, is not that I'm missing out on my therapy sessions, but because the people I've encountered at Dovetail have been some of the nicest shopkeepers I've encountered anywhere (and I travel a bit). I love vintage clothing and always have. What I've become accustomed to is going into a vintage store, where I wander aimlessly throughout, pulling out one by one to discern sizing and price, and pretty much not being spoken to until I make it to the counter three hours later with one item to buy. At Dovetail, I was immediately greeted, allowed to wander for a few minutes, then asked if I needed help or had \"anything specific in mind I was looking for\" (and yes that's a direct quote I remembered since it was the first time anyone in a vintage store or boutique ever asked it to me), then when I answered I needed help I received it. Simple as that. Because surviving vintage pieces always tend to be skinny minnie size, the owner?/sales associate, looked me over, walked to a rack (color arranged), sifted instinctively passed all the colors that with suck with my mocha choca latte skin tone and brought out the aforementioned cream and gold halter dress and a fabulous peachy sheath that makes me want to shake my booty just thinking about it. I tried on both, the halter was an off label and only $30 and the peachy sheath w/ hand stitching was a label and $165; the owner/sales associate looked me over in them both and said the cream halter was a better fit from my skin tone and body build and would be more versatile and gently weened me away from the too snug sheath . That girl (what a cutie) saved me $130 and the embarrassment of looking like a mottled sausage or going on that diet. Because I paid with cash, she even gave me a discount. Seriously. As for price, Dovetail is the most fairly priced vintage I've encountered in Chicago. Somehow non serious vintage shoppers have gotten it into their heads that vintage should always mean cheap and it's my belief (handed down from my grandmother and great aunts) that if you want cheap old clothes then you can head to the resale shops or Am Vets or the Salvation Army (all of which I do) and when you want quality vintage pieces that will anchor your wardrobe or be your statement piece for years to come, you pay for it. I have a vintage dress I bought five years ago at $185, it needs some work but I plan on wearing it on my wedding day. Vintage is about commitment not some cheap score (though it's nice when it happens). It's possible to find both a cheap score and a piece for years to come at Dovetail.

Its BYOB which is a plus and they did not charge a corking fee, but that is where the pros about this place stop. It was a saturday night, so I expect that's a busy night, but it should not take 20 minutes for the waitress to come to your table. Then we had to ask for glasses and ice for our drinks. Did she think we were going to drink out of the bottle?? There is a $20.00 purchase limit per person, however, most of the food on the limited menu was \"all sold out\". So I guess we were supposed to smoke 8 separate hookas to meet our $20.00 quota? If you are a first timer, they still treat you like you should know what you are doing and give absolutely no info other than \"these are the flavors and you need to spend $20.00.\" After raising the issue with the manager, she says \"we don't give group discounts\" I didn't ask for a discount, I was just letting you know if you don't have any other items on your menu but $3.00 soft drinks and $4.00 chocolate cake, how do you expect a large group to meet their dollar quota. I guess she didn't have an answer so she said we only needed to spend $15.00 per person. We ordered chocolate cake to go and they wrapped 5 pieces in one big piece of foil, not separately. All in all I just felt like they could care less about customer service and just wanted u to meet your dollar quota and leave.

I went for lunch on Saturday at 12:15 pm and they had just opened at noon and were still mopping the floors and prepping for the day. No worries I thought, so I seated myself and shortly after I was greeted and offered water and a menu. After my friend arrived, I ordered the shrimp rolls... or so I thought. Another table of about 4 had arrived during this time as well and I kept seeing their food delivered but nothing came for me. I was about to ask when I should expect my appetizer when my server attempted to place a shrimp maki roll on my place setting. I did clearly say shrimp rolls which is on the menu as \"shrimp rolls\" and not a shrimp maki roll. Sigh* She tried to see if I'd still want that maki instead but nah... that's not what I ordered. I'm very familiar with Butterfly's menu (see my 5 star review for the Grand location which is my go-to sushi spot in the city) and I was craving the deep fried, cheese shrimp rolls appetizer. When my order did arrive, I was disappointed again. I don't think I tasted any cheese at all! How sad. I also ordered the salmon maki roll which was fine and a Thai iced tea which was good and served in a cute mason jar mug.Overall, I've had much better food at the Grand and Madison locations and probably won't frequent this one too often. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with the 3 stars... there was a grand opening sign outside. I guess they re-grand opened???

One-piece, right?\"And this was how my afternoon went at Seek shopping with my mom.I've been walking past this store waiting for it to open for a few months. After a visit to Noble Grape to exhaust my weekly wine budget, I was finally able to pop in. I knew my mom wouldn't mind. She used to drive around trolling for garage sales when I was younger.

She's a woman who is after the steal.I'm a vintage newb, as in, I have bought nothing from a second-hand store. However, I envy my friends who can come out looking smashing for very little money with their vintage finds. In my opinion, Seek is how vintage shopping should be. It's a store owned by two people completely passionate about the \"steal.\" They love finding stuff. Garage sales, estate sales, yard sales...you name it, they go there to find some fantastic finds. \u00a0Peeps after my mother's heart, indeed.The best assortment of vintage-y clutches at ridiculously good prices. I scored a darling little leather number for $14. A steal, indeed. I had my eye on a beaded white sparkly number as well...gives me reason to return, right?And dresses galore! I bought one of the owner's gram's dresses. $35. The perfect frock for a summer wedding. And had the buttons not been too tight on a crochet trimmed dress, I'd have snagged that for $18. Too bad for me. But good for bargain-hunting girls smaller than me. Go there and get it. It has pockets and is beautiful.The housing goods assortment is stellar. Glasses, old ash trays, coffee mugs...you name it, you can likely find something to add the perfect vintage sparkle to your kitchen. Clean, well-organized with two fitting rooms, a fabulous edition to my beloved Chicago Avenue. I'm so glad I finally made it in there.

This particular visit was my first time and everything was just ok. The place is pretty cool everything else just kindof fell a little short. I came in for dinner by recommendation with my BF and two of his buddies. One of the guys and my BF have eaten here on numerous occasions and vouched for the place. Needless to say I was expecting to be blown away.The moment we were handed our menus I thought to myself \"wow there is a ton to choose from\". I was a little ahead of myself, it was only the drink menu. Great for the guys but I'm more interested in the food and specifically what I was going to order! I should mention that I do have certain food restrictions being a strict vegetarian. That said, the menu is pretty limited. I honestly thought my menu was missing a page or two. Not much to choose from, everything looked great but there wasn't much for me to eat... The guys decided on a Burger, Chicken sandwich, and the Buffalo Chicken tenders. They loved their dishes and overall they were pretty satisfied! I on the other hand got shafted and ordered an Egg Sandwich (it was all I could actually eat) -- not exactly something I would order myself for dinner but when in Rome, right? The sandwich was ok, I'll give them that, but I was hoping for something more than just a Grilled Cheese (so boring!). It was good but I was not impressed, I wanted the experience the guys were having with their meals. oh well. One thing I have to commend the Twisted Spoke for is how fast our food came out. I'm not entirely sure if it was do to the fact that it wasn't as busy or these cooks really know what they're doing! As far as the service is concerned I found it to be somewhat awkward and a little cold. Our waiter was very quiet, I honestly did not understand or hear a single word he said the entire time. I can't really say that he was attentive to our table or any other within our vicinity.

When our food came, poppers tasted just like the frozen ones you get at target, cheese curds were barely cheesy and had the grossest salad dressing as a dipping sauce. My tuna 'wich tasted exactly like the tuna steaks I buy @ Trader Joes (2 for $7) that I make with with way more seasonings. Her po boy was blah. I had a bite and felt like the shrimp was 99% breading with dried out lettuce. My hubby and his friend loved their burgers, so I guess this is a strictly burger and beer place. That's cool.

After reading some really negative reviews here I decided to give my two cents and explain why I love this place so much. In the process I plan on addressing some of the complaints I've seen on their yelp page. Firstly, the coffee shop is very nicely decorated and isn't crammed at all. So, coming here for an afternoon get together with friends over some coffee and food is aesthetically pleasing. I was always greeted by the staff nicely and felt welcome. Speaking of the staff, one of you guys is owed a huge thank you for helping me get my friend out of the restroom that wasn't even locked (said friend is simply confused by how doors work). Thanks for helping and laughing it off. Since I've been here quite a few times I can speak for several dishes that I personally enjoy: Savory- Italian sandwich (get the potato salad as a side, much better pairing than pasta salad), carbonara and napolitan pasta, tirokafteri and the Mediterranean plate are great appetizers. They make a good club sandwich as well. If you want a lighter option their salmon salad is a good choice.Sweet- the Greek yogurt and Nutella & banana crepe. Coffee- I've tried a bunch of their coffees, they make European style coffees that taste great. But I'm not going to give suggestions for the coffee, they have so many options I can only suggest you get adventurous and try something you haven't had before, or explore the different syrup options for a custom drink. Now that food and drinks are covered lets talk about the service pace. Yes, it takes a while to get the check. The famed European style service that I hear about and experience a lot when dining in Eastern European places around town (and, well, in Eastern Europe in general) is present here as well. It truly is a thing, and I firmly believe it is due to trying not to have the patrons feel rushed, as opposed to what others have said (facebooking and ignoring patrons for no reason). Having that said, your water glasses will always be full and you will have ample opportunity to order additional items off the menu if you so choose. In a hurry? Don't appreciate the European dining pace? Me too! So now that you've been warned, make sure to mention to your server that you'd like the check to come out with your food and it will. Problem solved. As for the review about split checks and being forced to order food... I split checks just about every other time I go here and it is never a problem. You were asked to order something at a place of business that offers food and beverages? How shocking! Iguana might have a homey feel to it but you are not, in fact, in your own living room. Another thing I should mention for those that live or work around the area but are in a rush and don't have time to sit down and enjoy a meal- call them about 15 minutes before you can come in and place a to go order, your food will be waiting for you and you can merrily go on with your day. Iguana saved me from plenty of bad lunch option days at UIC.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 7, 20]}, "24": {"description": "Decent small place, we went in there last week for brunch. We went more for the food advertised than the coffee part. Overall an ok place except for one huge detail, see below at the last comments.I had one of there crepes, it was good, a little sloppier than id prefer butit still tasted good. We shared the crab/cheese dip app and it was also very good. In fact it was probably the best tasting thing of the whole time we were there. My wife had the chicken sandwich and complained it was very dry. The staff didnt seem too motivated to be serving but we were there early around noon, not sure if thats an excuse or not but whatever. Our server cracked a smile here and there but nothing that made you feel comfortable or made you want to jump at the idea of goin back soon. Pricing was ok i guess, although I can count on one hand an easy number of places that serve much better food in larger portions for the same prices if not less. Overall it wasnt horrible and if I happen to be in the area and hungry enough I may stop by again. One of my BIGGEST disappointments was their Bloody Mary....After a night of normal drinking and waking up the next morning hungry for a good meal and thirsty for a nice hearty Bloody Mary to just start your day off right and set you up for a good day, a place like this you would imagine might offer just that right bloody for ya. Nope, it literally was like they cracked open a store brand can of tomato juice and added vodka to it, thats it! My wife is an experienced bartender so on top of me knowing good drinks thanks to her I also know and understand the level of certain places a place can offer and what can be expected. But there was honestly no excuse for this poor Bloody Mary. They couldve AT LEAST added some lime, and 3 olives as a garnish and it wouldve been an attempt, hell a pickle, celery stick. Salt on the rim, SOMETHING. Haha i never expect a fancy tower of garnishes and a bloody mary that has to be prepared by a chef type of deal but like I said...its not hard to put a toothpick through 3 olives, a squirt of lime and maybe a dash or two of hot sauce and your off to a good start lol. A couple bottles of either Zing Zang or Tobasco's bloody mixes to have around would make a WORLD of difference and still keep your cost down. PS.

It could not be a better location for an office full of snobbish 20-somethings to indulge in some good coffee during their breaks. Here's the thing that should be scaring Cafe Blue. NONE OF US GO THERE. Look, the coffee is pretty good. I'd even say it's better than average, but it's so outrageously expensive that even a bunch of hip kids can't get behind it. I've been on a iced coffee/cold brew kick the last several weeks and for my $2.50, Dunkin' Donuts has a decent, large cup of iced coffee that I'm more than happy to make a walk down Chicago Ave for. But today, I figured I'd stick close to the office and get a cup from Cafe Blue. Here's what I learned: if you want cold brew from Cafe Blue, you're going to pay over $4 for 16 ounces. Now, Dunkin's coffee isn't as high-quality and they probably don't actually cold-brew the coffee, so let's throw that example out. If you wanted a 16 oz cup of cold brew here in Chicago, you could go to Intelligentsia (nectar of the Gods) and get one for $3.75. Okay, comparable price. How about Starbucks? $3.25 for their new cold brew. And again, the coffee is pretty damn good! I have no qualms with the quality of the product here, just the price of it. I thought it was just my small-town mentality, but speaking with the natives in my office, nobody thinks this brew is worth the price-tag. I know that a proper cold-brew isn't cheap, but I think in this case, Cafe Blue is missing out on a lot of business. The story here is that quality comes at a price, and it comes over quantity. The same could be said for its counterpart restaurant next door, \"Jerk.\" It's good, but is it worth it? No. No it isn't.UPDATE: I've been in touch with the owner of Cafe Blue and Jerk, and he's informed me that they've reviewed their menu prices and have made significant changes across the board. Including lowering the price of cold brew coffee to $3.25, which I consider a fair price.

I can forgive incompetency to a certain degree, but when you are too lazy to make an effort to solve an issue, it is unforgiveable.The issue on hand is relating to a warranty exchange of a broken water heater. The manufacturer has already approved the warranty exchange because the warranty is still in effect. We were told to just swing by Home Depot to get a new replacement. When we arrived, the store manager told us that there is nothing he could do as he needs a RGA number in order to process the return, but they are closed until Monday. We were not the only ones with similar warranty exchange requests at the store. There were several people behind us with the same request for different products. Not getting anywhere with this store manager, we proceeded to just call Home Depot's corporate line directly. Diana at the call center was able to patch in the manufacturer and got an authorization under the water heater's serial number. Once approved, the store manager just had to enter the serial number into the computer system to process the warranty exchange. We passed this information to the store manager and he reluctantly processed the exchange. He didn't seem too happy about doing it either, though we can't understand why. In summary, the store manager was either too lazy to make that phone call, or he was too incompetent to realize that's all he had to do. Either way, wasting 2 hours of a customer's time and finally having the customer solve an issue that should have been owned by the store is completely unacceptable.

No one was working in the flooring department the morning I went to do this (9:15 AM week day arrival).I waited for 20+ minutes in the department without assistance along with other customers and called the store on the phone while sitting in the store to try and get someone's attention. My call was routed and re-rerouted continuously while I sat there. Employees not qualified to assist in the department walked through the department and called for an MOD to come to the department. No one qualified bothered to show so I left. In my car I tried calling the store again to talk to a manager. I finally did. He apologized and said multiple people in that department had called off today. He said due to my trouble he would have the \"required\" $35 in home measurement done at no cost to me and someone would call to schedule shortly.

He told he was supposed to provide an inflated quote over the phone but that the actual quote with measurement should be lower. (WHAT??) We ended the call with him committing someone would call me on the day of my measurement between 7-9 AM to provide me with a time window. I received an email welcoming me to their install system with a contact number and email address.Today, the day of appointment no one called as promised (am I surprised?).

Since I'm not a local I can't speak to the culture that this place has floating around it, or to their array of workshops/guest speakers. I didn't see anything advertised when I was there.The second I entered, I was told I wasn't allowed to be on my phone (I was talking on my cell phone at the time; what can I say, I love to multitask). I raised my eyebrows and finished my conversation outside - if this wasn't my only hour long free time slot and my only plan after missioning to the opposite area of the city, I probs would have peaced out due to the not-chill-ness of the dude who told me to STFU. Anyway. Lucky for them I went in I guess? I feel like most places that would have been a deal-breaker for me. For some reason photos of the interior of this place are also not allowed, which pissed me off. Anyway - I was not super impressed with the overall selection at this place. Their stock was seriously diminished to the point of almost entire shelves being empty. There were some cute displays of devotional statuary (I am assuming someone at this shop works with the lwa?) and nice decorations on the walls. I did like the layout of the place, and they had a decent selection of jewelry and herbal shit for sale. Book selection - mostly used and in poor condition, but still somehow selling for full price? Very dusty, and not the best selection of titles. Lot of stuff from the 80s. Also they had books on non-occult topics, like computers and other random shit that I was like whaaa?

It was a pleasant surprise to find that here, and wish the other stuff on the shelves were as pleasant to encounter.The reason I would go back to this store (probably) and why I'm giving it three stars instead of two is because of their nonchalant rare book collection. To a discerning eye there are some very interesting things that they have for sale (and this is fetching in the thousands of dollars) - rare stuff that it is almost impossible to find in person, let alone sitting on a shelf at what is more or less a used bookstore. The clerk didn't know exactly what it was that they had, but they did know that it was worth something. The trip to this store was worth it to see that book in person alone.

After 15 minutes I tried unsuccessfully to get the attention of the receptionist and had a flag down someone else since my feet were wet. She came over and told me that the other nail tech was on her way. She hoped she would be there soon, but her phone had died. I was frustrated she didn't mention this when I checked in because I would have left and came back. no big deal.

When I made the appointment I let them know I had the Groupon for those 2 services.I get to the salon at 11:55 a.m. for my 12:00 appointment on a Saturday. Even though there are 3 hair stylists walking around, fixing each other's hair, eating lunch, curling heir hair, chatting with each other, no one is able to take my appointment as I wait for 25 minutes.I don't understand if one hair stylist is running late with a current appointment, why they didn't just give my appointment to one of the other 3 people doing nothing? Anyways 30 minutes later the lady is finally ready and she says \"I'm so sorry for running late I'm going to give you this awesome deep conditioning treatment for free since you had to wait\".It really really really bothers me that I made an appointment with the Groupon for the deep conditioning treatment and the receptionist never transfers that piece of information over to the hair stylist.So I said \"oh I'm already paying for that with the Groupon I bought\". Awesome.Anyways she rushes me over to the place where they wash your hair. She dunks my head in the water without ever glancing at what my hair is like. Right away I'm nervous, most salons will look at your hair when it's dry to understand the texture, if it's naturally straight or curly, etc. Not here, just right to the hair wash with no questions asked. Then she put the conditioner in my hair and left me for 20 minutes while she finished up her other client. My friend brought this Groupon and said she received a head massage while waiting. I was left waiting in the dust, while they have their main door open and a draft coming in, I'm freezing with my head wet for 20 minutes. Literally at 1:00 she started to cut my hair when my original appointment was at 12:00. She asks very few questions then starts chopping and chopping and chopping and more layers and more texturizing and this and that. I start to get nervous because my hair is wavy and wavy doesn't do good with many layers and much texture because it turns into frizz. After she's done blow drying my hair she goes \"oh I thought your hair was naturally straight....but this haircut should still be okay.\"That's what happens when you don't ask questions or even LOOK at the persons hair before you start cutting it.Anyways my haircut sucks and the deep conditioning treatment is useless because after 2 washes my hair was back to its normal self.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 5, 29]}, "45": {"description": "It was very challenging to get an appointment with dynamic for for a mani pedi.

My second no-chip was alright, but you could tell the polish color I'd chosen was old - the manicurist kept tipping it upside-down to get the polish on the brush. The weirdest part about this one is that she took off my original no-chip, clipped and filed my nails - but didn't buff them. So they were still rough when she started painting them. I've had my fair share of no-chips and that's never been the way I've seen it done. Then, instead of using lotion on my hands, she used oil - the hand massage was 10 stars for sure - but driving home I had to wipe off my steering wheel because it was all oiled up. Again - what?

And to her defense, when we went in to pay we realized she was the only one working - both the front bar and the back patio area so seems a little more she was just in a rush than trying to brush off our excitement. Checked out the menu but didn't order. Seemed typical bar food. Bar menu was sufficient and the Irish Mule fantastic. It is served in a copper mug but you do have to leave an id or credit card as a deposit...apparently they \"walk out\" of there enough that you get the heads up you'll be charged $30 if the mug isn't returned.

My initial call with Amie was very pleasant and I was able to schedule an appointment within a few weeks. First impression is her salon is so cute, inviting and very clean. Amie was also a delight from the moment I walked through the door. We first sat and chatted about my hair concerns and what I am looking to achieve. I have naturally blonde hair with blonde balayage highlights... at least that's what I've been wanting. The salon/stylist I visited the previous three times I had my hair colored ended in results that I did not like. I have been trying to achieve a very cool, creamy blonde color but ended up with awful yellow balayage highlights. On top of that my roots were colored to be very warm, which is exactly the opposite of what I wanted/asked for. I was told by the previous stylist that my hair could not get to the color I wanted and that my hair is \"stubborn\". I knew this wasn't true as my hair has been highlighted cool blonde most of my hair coloring life. Anyway, that made me search for a new stylist and I am so grateful I found Amie! She listened to every single concern I had, explained the best way to get my color where I wanted then did her magic. She is a true hair artist. The color turned out way better than I expected, she transformed my yellow blonde hair to the beautiful cool, beige blonde exactly like I had envisioned and almost given up hope I could achieve. She also managed to tone down the brassiness of the base color so now the colors blend beautifully. I have not felt this great about my hair in so long and it's all thanks to Amie. Also, she is extremely friendly and easy to talk to. I've already recommended her to multiple people looking for a new stylist, they see the amazing transformation of my hair so her work actually speaks for itself.

I am extremely picky about my hair, and have gone to enough salons and hair transformations to know what a good cut and color looks like. I had not dyed my dark brown hair for about 7 years, but had been thinking about having the ombre look done to my hair for a couple of years now. Last week I went into Kelly Cardenas to have the ombre done to my hair, where I met Taya, my stylist. I showed her a picture of exactly how I wanted the ombre to look, expressed and reiterated to her how I wanted it to be SUBTLE, how I hadn't dyed my hair in about 7 years so I was nervous, and told her I would like the color to be more on the ends and underneath my hair. Taya basically did the exact opposite of everything that I wanted. When she washed out the color and blow dried my hair, the color was not subtle. The bottom half of my hair had various shades of blonde highlights, and she kept telling me, \"You'll like it when it's all done.\" Needless to say, I did NOT like it when she was finished. I told her it was way too light, and she proceeded to tell me to go home and feel it out for a couple of days, and to come back if I still didn't like it. Knowing right then I didn't like it, I asked her if she could darken the blonde highlights. She ended up putting a gloss toner on my hair to darken everything. My hair ended up looking better than what it first looked like, but I went home still unsatisfied. It was not an ombre, but more like highlights that started from the bottom half of my hair, it wasn't subtle, and it was not the color I asked for. While she did my ombre, she was doing the weaving technique to highlight my hair, I should have known right then it was not going to end well. A couple days later I called back because I disliked everything about the color Taya did, where I was told to come back in and she would fix it. The next week I came in, explained what I wanted again, and showed more pictures of the color I wanted. To my surprise, the ombre turned out WORSE. The top half of my hair was colored black, and the bottom half had more various shades of blonde, nothing was blended, and I just thought I completely ruined my natural hair that I had for so long. I would have been better off never going in to have the ombre done to begin with. Being really upset with my experience, I called back and asked to speak with a manager. The manager told me come back in for a third time to get my hair done by someone with a little more experience. I decided I absolutely did not want to go back to this place again, so I asked for a full refund. This is where the two stars comes in, the manager did not give me a hard time about the refund, gave me all my money back, and had it ready for me to pick up that day. Fortunately, I went somewhere else where they did an amazing job fixing up the botched ombre from Kelly Cardenas. They knew exactly what I wanted, could see exactly what went wrong with the ombre, and used the balayage technique to create my desired ombre.", "rating": "2", "date": [2014, 8, 19]}, "44": {"description": "Quite possibly the best haircut/style I've had, ever.

I'm so happy she talked me into it. Also a benefit of having color done as well as haircut I did two shampoo room visits today. It was heaven. Honestly the young lady who shampooed and massaged today was outstanding. I love that room and gladly make the half hour drive to experience it. I also need to add: Somehow I ended up confusing my appointment time and showed up 2 hrs early. They graciously fitted me in.

It's energetic and the people are quite friendly. The service is also very good. They will run and refill your meter for you if time is running short. The shampoo area is in a separate room with dimmed lights and soft music, and the massage is lovely. But this is about it for what good I experienced here. I originally called asking to see a senior stylist that same day, explaining that I have dealt with beginner stylists before with disastrous results. They had none available that day - fair enough - and offered to have me see one of their junior stylists who was very experienced and skilled with long hair. I expressed my concern and they were very reassuring so I thought I would take a chance. Bad idea. When I arrived, I was sitting and waiting for at least 30 minutes past my appointment time. They also don't have assigned stations for their stylists, so if all the seats are full when your shampoo is done, you are basically just waiting in the colouring area with your wet towel until one opens up. This isn't something I would not come back for, but it would have been nice to know ahead so I could factor in the extra time into my schedule. After a long wait, I had a stylist come to greet me and take over ... not who my appointment was supposed to be with. At first I thought he was just shampooing my hair, and I eventually asked about the mix up. He said he was assigned to me and didn't know why the confusion. This was the first major aggravation. I have no idea why I didn't see who I was scheduled to see. I found this extremely unprofessional, especially considering no one addressed it with me prior to the appointment starting. I very specifically explained what I was looking for and the problems I have had in the past and the way my hair works. I wanted thicker layers, chunkier face framing layered bangs no shorter than below my eyebrows, and a slight trim. To avoid confusion, I provided pictures. Long story short, I came home with a haircut that brought me to tears. It was nothing like what I asked for, and in fact my hair looked in worse condition than when I arrived. It now looks like dry straw, with layers that looked frayed and sheared. And the \"bangs\" were a nightmare: wispy, shorter than what I asked for (which I pointed out to him and received no response or apology) and looking like a 5 year old attached my hair in my sleep. I can see why some people like this place. The service apart from the haircut is good, but the actual haircut itself was a nightmare. The stylist I saw clearly had limited experience and was just spewing out information he obviously just learned in school. I haven't walked away from a haircut this upset for 10 years.

Shockingly I had to explain this wasn't what I wanted and it looked bad (wish I took a pic of that to share). She was blow drying and commenting on how good it looked. Yes she was super nice but she needed me to explain why I didn't like this gross dull grey color. Kind of awkward. Why do I need to explain to a salon director why ugly color is bad?So she \"fixed\" it and I left with reddish pink hair (see pic). Again nothing like I wanted. I was hoping I could deal with it for a bit but ended up calling the next day begging for someone to fix it ASAP. I was put with Jessica. Unfortunately she needed to consult Taya, the salon director, the one that screwed up my hair in the first place (no idea how she was appointed director - it's concerning). I like Jessica and I actually think she is talented. She wasn't able to do much since damage was done but she tried her best to fix it. If you go here see her.

I'm not from Chicago and happened to be in town, in this little restaurant, enjoying this treat. The flavor is phenomenal and you may get a spicy bite or a sweet bite depending what portion of the chile you get. Nevertheless, it's all good.

She was very rude to the entire party and was arguing with a customer over what she was told and if it was posted on the website. Even still, we have not been able to find this information posted on the website. From this point it took the waitress another 15 minutes at least to come check on us at which point we were also told now that we couldn't open all of the drinks at one time due to a one bottle per night for every two people rule. Not everyone was drinking the same things so this added another layer of complication to our already horrible start. It was complicated enough organizing the evening with 11 people and this was the icing on the cake. You would think they would be more willing to work with a larger party to accommodate especially since we would be spending so much at their restaurant. 35 minutes after sitting down (having the waitress only come over once during that time) we were ready to just order some food and put the issues behind us. When we asked for two orders of guacamole the owners response was \"we sell food here you can't just sit here all night and eat guacamole and drink\". This comment was offensive and unwarranted because while we were frustrated we were never rude to anyone. All we were trying to do was put in something to order while we figured out the rest of the dishes we wanted to order.

We had no trouble making a reservation on Friday night for Saturday night. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately. Many comment on the alcohol rules at Shaman, but I have a solution for you. Tequila! Shaman has great margarita mix and you can bring one bottle per two people. Easy.

This is a menu item that stays, even as the rest rotates, and I think I order it every time I'm there. \u00a0As I mentioned, half of the menu at Shaman rotates monthly which is pretty amazing. The fall menu was absolutely on-point and we loved every dish. If you're going in the near future, don't miss the chile en nogada which apparently has over 30 ingredients?! My personal favorite was the brisket casuela which you could make little tacos with. The complex flavors were hearty and rich. We also enjoyed the calamari (which is far from your normal calamari), grilled flank steak, goat cheese empanadas, and the RIBS. These are always on the menu and, in my opinion, a must order. I have no idea what's in that sauce, but it rocks.We also shared a few desserts, even though we were so full! The coconut cream pie was my absolute favorite and everyone loved the sweet empanadas, these were a little rich for me.

After a 2 minute \"rules\" rundown and what appeared to be her own disapproval regarding our table of 5 having a bottle of tequila to share (which is encouraged, as the restaurant provides Margarita mix for purchase!), she finally allowed us to open the tequila and brought us margarita mix. \u00a0The kitchen brought out the wrong order and when we let them know that was not our order, the waitress glared at us and scolded \"that's yours,\" to which we politely replied we had not ordered it. \u00a0Later in the night and 7 small plates later, a friend who does not drink tequila asked to open the bottle of wine she brought, to which the server rudely replied no and went on to explain that unless we ordered more food, we were not allowed another open bottle. We verified that what she was saying was that the byob policy was directly tied to the amount we spend and she said yes. Unbelievable. The waitresses tone, demeanor and lack of service left us all feeling like we were school kids on time out. Thanks for the great birthday dinner, Shaman...Also, fyi, they only allow 2 cards per table, so just keep that in mind if you decide to try this place (though I encourage you to try anything else instead).

The food is delicious. Their BYOB rules are tough but that's okay because the food is GOOD and they know it. We will start with atmosphere: it's dark, cozy and nice. No complaints. Drinks: \u00a0bring some tequila. Get the margarita mix. You will not be disappointed. Food: we had a large group of seven and probably ordered 3/4 of the menu. Now I should note that Shaman changes their menu every 30 days? Now don't quote me on this but it's something like that. \u00a0Our party of 7 started off with the guacamole, the spinach salad, and the mahi ceviche. All awesome. I was not looking forward to the spinach salad with all the other delciousness going around but that salad was AWESOME! Simple, tasty, and satisfying. It was a great surprise and truly a treat. \u00a0We also got the fried calamari (awesomeness that doesn't even need the sauce) beef brisket cazuela, grilled flank steak, pork ribs, and enchiladas. All very delicious. Shaman has very complex, unique flavors but somehow has a simple perfect presentation. They don't try to do too much and let the flavors do the work. Now I felt the need to write this review for the chiles en nogada, which had pork picadillo, walnut cream sauce, goat cheese, nectarines, and almonds. I truly enjoyed the history the waitress gave us. Apparently this is a 32 ingredient dish, which is a Mexican delicacy/favorite that represents the Mexican flag, and only comes around once a year. \u00a0Im not going to lie.. I felt a little lucky. I'm not from Chicago and happened to be in town, in this little restaurant, enjoying this treat. The flavor is phenomenal and you may get a spicy bite or a sweet bite depending what portion of the chile you get. Nevertheless, it's all good. The flavors blend in your mouth and for that moment you understand why this dish is so celebrated in Mexico.Last but not least, dessert: we had the tres leches, peanut butter empanadas, and coconut cream pie.

The only downside to Chilam is that they 1) don't take weekend reservations and 2) don't accept big parties. Fortunately, Shaman solves both of these issues! We had no trouble making a reservation on Friday night for Saturday night. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately. Many comment on the alcohol rules at Shaman, but I have a solution for you. Tequila! Shaman has great margarita mix and you can bring one bottle per two people. Easy. Our waitress came over right away with the mix and to explain the menu.Same as Chilam Balam, we loved the ceviche. This is a menu item that stays, even as the rest rotates, and I think I order it every time I'm there. \u00a0As I mentioned, half of the menu at Shaman rotates monthly which is pretty amazing. The fall menu was absolutely on-point and we loved every dish. If you're going in the near future, don't miss the chile en nogada which apparently has over 30 ingredients?! My personal favorite was the brisket casuela which you could make little tacos with. The complex flavors were hearty and rich. We also enjoyed the calamari (which is far from your normal calamari), grilled flank steak, goat cheese empanadas, and the RIBS. These are always on the menu and, in my opinion, a must order. I have no idea what's in that sauce, but it rocks.We also shared a few desserts, even though we were so full! The coconut cream pie was my absolute favorite and everyone loved the sweet empanadas, these were a little rich for me. I truly enjoyed visiting Shaman with a big group because we were easily able to share tons of menu items.

I loved the fact that they had hair dryers as chairs, plus it was made for a nice photo opp. The bar portion was very clean, and since it was early, their bartenders weren't too busy. The music was good, not great. We attended the Freedom Party, and I was expecting hip hop the entire night, but they played somewhat lame motown-esque club remix hits for the first hour we were there. Lame. Then they played dancehall, which was AWESOME. And after that, it was 90s hip hop, which I loved.

You will definitely be bumped into and shoved. I hear that Tuesday's normally don't get busy and Saturday is when it gets packed, but again this can change depending on what event is happening.-There are two dance floors, the main area where the bar is, and a smaller room with a cool disco ball that gets opened when the place starts to really fill up.- Wear comfortable shoes because the few seats they do have will be taken, like all night long. - They do have coat check for a small fee, it might have been $2 not sure.- If you pay for the martini/manicure ($10 on Tuesday) combo your drink will be strong :) but your manicure will be basic even borderline bad. While the manicurist was sweet she applied way to many layers of polish and top coat. My nails started off as cute then quickly began to wrinkle before my eyes. BUT hey it was $10 and the drink was truly strong. - There are only 3 stalls in the ladies restroom so there will be a line. ALSO it's located all the way in the back, so If it's packed and you just so happen to be closer to the entrance you will have to push your way through a crowd.

Two gals were manning the manicure table, and churning them out pretty quickly. It's a bit no frills, but for what you pay, it's decent: just a quick file and buffer, with a couple coats and quick dry top coat.

Our favorite pasta dish is the Green Noodles Alforno, ordered it the first time we went some years ago, and continued to order the same dish the first couple of times we went, it was that good. We've also had the NY Steak and lamb chops, all amazing dishes.

My husband and I made reservations for 8:30 p.m. on Valentine's Day. We got there 10 minutes before our reservation time to find the front lobby filled with waiting customers.

People who had 8 pm reservations were being seated at 8:30. Why over book yourselves on a holiday?? We couldn't go anywhere else since it was Valentine's Day.

The food was terrible!! We had the Shrimp Francaise and Green Noodles Alforno. Both were so bland, especially the green noodles.Green noodles and spinach were just boiled, thrown on a plate with some of the pasta water in the plate and that was it. I am also pretty sure \"alforno\" means baked, but this pasta was not baked. I took no more than one bite, I could have easily done that for myself at home. All they did was cook the food, no seasonings or anything. We will never be back here and I do not understand why anyone would even come here. If you want bland food and terrible service, come here. It was also so dark in this restaurant you couldn't see the person in front of you or read the menu.The couple behind our table took out their cellphone flashlight to read their menu which was not a bad idea.

HOWEVER......HOWEVER...It doesn't matter how good your food is if you place zero emphasis on service and taking care of your customers. Let me set the stage for you: Sunday night, early dinner, upcoming Blackhawks game. Bella Notte seemed like the perfect place to grab a quick (and delicious) bite to eat and then head to the Madhouse.Our party arrives and is seated promptly. That's great. The restaurant was more or less empty but there was some commotion upstairs (which we later discovered was a private party). Drinks and appetizers are ordered and we are on our way. Our dinner rez was early (4:30 PM) because the puck drops at 6:00. We inform the waiter that we are going to the Hawks game and that we need to be fed and out of there in a reasonable amount of time.After a while, we realize that there's no food coming out of the kitchen. For anybody. And then all of a sudden, there's a rush of waiters and waitresses and staff coming from the kitchen and they scurry upstairs. We are now approaching 5:15 PM. Our group asks our waiter when we can expect the food and we are informed that it is coming out soon.But then nothing happened.Someone else came up to the table and explained that due to the party upstairs and a large amount of delivery orders they were running behind. There was no apology, no real concern - it was like they were going through the motions. Around 5:30 PM, the food arrived. We were left with realistically 15 minutes to eat as much as we could and then jet over to the United Center for the game. There's nothing quite like eating a family sized portion of piping hot pasta in 5 minutes. During this entire time, the waitstaff went about their business as if this is something that happens regularly throughout the week.And after all this, their valet charged extra for us to leave a car at the restaurant while we drove to the game. Even though the only reason why we left the car was because their staff couldn't admit that they forgot to put in our food order and continued to defend themselves (and simultaneously blame others) rather than take ownership of the situation.Bravo!PROS: Great foodCONS: Everything else", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 11, 18]}, "40": {"description": "Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to, in my life.

We LAUGHED so hard one of us even snorted! LOL! Kudos for her - big points for the personality!! We then proceeded to the Sushi Bar area. Anyways, the sushi was actually pretty damn great.

After each step he would check with me and allow me to provide feedback before progressing. Towards the end when I thought he was all done he then busted out the shaving cream, lined it around the edges of my neckline and ears and took a straight razor to shave a nice natural hairline without any strays.

Just the right amount of crispiness that makes you eat an entire plateful before you know it. But it's not just their potato products. Everything on the menu is amazing. Even their pizza is impressive!THESE ARE A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS:* Pulled Pork Quesadillas* Turkey Reuben * Southwestern Wrap* Delux Salad* Nachos* ChiliWhatever you order, you cannot go wrong.

For my birthday, earlier in the year, I brought my parents, wife and my son and daughter. At the end of the meal, my dad insisted on paying for the meal, our waitress, ran his card, and came back, with it already run, and my dad added the tip. About four months later, my wife and I happened to be in Delux, when that same waitress, whose name is Ashley, waited on us that night. She asked if we'd been in a few months earlier with an older man, it took me a bit, but put it together as my dad, plus everyone else in the family, so I asked if that was when she was talking about, and she said yes. Keep in mind, we went to Delux at least once a week, and would order take out at least one to two times per week, as well, typically on week nights, which apparently Ashley doesn't work, or we just never crossed paths with her. Ashley then proceeded to tell us that something was wrong with my dad's credit card, and the charge didn't go through. Number one, remember that she had already authorized it, and brought it back to the table for him to add the tip-if there was a problem with the card, she'd known it then. Number two, my dad uses his Disney credit card for every single thing to earn Disney points, and never, ever had a \"problem\" with it. So, anyways, I told her that I'd check with him to see if the charge went through, to which she protested and said that we would have to pay that night, and I could ask him later, or I could call him right then. I told her my dad isn't up that late at night, well, that didn't matter to Ashley, she added the previous bill from four months prior, to our bill from that night. She related that a manager did this, we've checked and this is ILLEGAL! Furthermore, during that night, Ashley was doing squats against the wall, with some patrons, and gave us some of the worst service, we've ever had. So, I did check with my dad, whom called his credit card company, to which they informed him, that Delux, did in fact run his card for authorization that day, but, drum roll please, they never put an actual charge through. So ASHLEY messed up and didn't put the charge through, she only authorized the card. I have zero problem with paying for the meals, where my problem lies, is, when we come in all the time, and I say I'll call my dad the next day, to check, to make sure his card didn't get charged, that's what you let us do. It'd already been four months since the bill had been improperly handled by Ashley, the business couldn't wait one more day, for regulars, to make sure there wasn't a mistake somewhere? Not to mention, again, that them adding a bill, that someone else had tried to pay, onto our bill, is ILLEGAL! Ashley, and/or the manager that was on duty that night, should know better, than to do what they did, it's a shame that Ashley's mistake on not putting the charge through, properly, resulted in this. No apology has been given to us, which is even a worse sign of how business is conducted here.

Well, at least my bartender and whoever hired her deserves it.

Since I was driving both him and I for the night I decided to not drink too much and started out with a water. He ordered his beer next to me, I ordered the water and she said \"Honey, this is a bar, we don't serve water\", I gave her a puzzled look and told her I was the designated driver for the night. After she stared me down awkwardly she finally poured me a cup of water. This was awkward for everyone around us, awkward enough for everyone to go outside and want a smoke.I join everyone outside where there's a large group of people and we smoke and talk out there for maybe 20 minutes. We get back inside and continue our night. Maybe an hour into the night I reached for my water and remembered that I had left it unattended while we were outside and decided to play it safe and order another water, I also ordered a beer. Same bartender, this time she got up halfway on the actual bar and said \"Honey, you can't just keep ordering water, this is a bar, we don't serve water\" and then pushed my old water back to me. When I explained that I had left it unattended and didn't feel comfortable drinking it she dumped it out, gave me a water bottle and charged me $2. Then she served me my beer. I watched her do shots all night. Climb up on the bar with her dirty knock off Doc Martens to whisper in customers ears all night and just plain be a terrible employee. Later through the night we discovered that the reason she was so rude to me was because she wanted to bang the guy I came with and was upset that he had come with a female friend. WTF are we 18 year olds? The entire night I felt like I was in some weird teenage drama with some weird bartender giving me death stares over a crush on my friend. FRIEND. It was awkward for everyone around, not just me. While my friend was interested in her large fake tits she kept jiggling around, her craziness eventually drove us all away. She was telling other customers to ask him if he was single, and ask me if I was okay with them talking and...it was all just very juvenile and strange. My friend is 29 and I am 24, we're both military veterans and I guess we just expect our bartender to act like at least a semi young adult.At one point throughout the night one of friends ordered shots for everyone, she forgot my shot glass and maybe 10 minutes later I was able to get her attention and ask her for one.OH, at the other end of the bar, with the other normal bartenders we joined some friends who had come in a group. One girl was the DD and she ordered water, she was given a large red solo cup of water FREE OF CHARGE and when I asked her to go ask for another one, she got another one FOR FREE. When I needed to pay my tab she just scribbled on a piece of paper in font of me and told me my total was $20. At this point I just wanted to leave. Overall terrible experience.

Yeah, yeah, bada-bing bada-boom-boom, you found it so look no further, because this joint is number one when it comes to subs. We love the made-to-order deli sandwiches. Picking just one of their masterpieces at this deli shop is no easy task, since every massive mound of bread, meat, and cheese here is nothing short of a Chicago treasure. Years ago, I tried the prosciutto, sopressata comprised of fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers and olive oil -- simply memorable -- fresh, chewy bread melds perfectly with the cold cuts and cheese. The savory olive spread adds an extra kick to the whole she-bang. We were astounded by the carniv-orgasmic offerings at this place when we first \u00a0came here over 10 years ago!You can try ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, mortadella with American, Swiss or provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, mustard, mayo, oil and vinegar, all packed on a fresh, fluffy Italian bread. The bread is simply ethereal. There are lots of solid options to choose from at this joint, which prides itself on creating sandwiches to satisfy every palette. Thick Italian bread envelops plump pieces of their meatballs, all elegantly smothered in delectable fresh mozzarella, Romano cheese and piping hot tomato sauce. Afterward, you can nap for weeks, awake refreshed (and five pounds heavier). My favorite sandwich here is their Italian sub (or Italian hero). If you want to have the gastronomical experience of a sub sandwich life time hit this place up for lunch.There is only one thing you need to know about this joint. What dat? What dat? The Italian sub is the one you want. Don't think twice! Just order it and step back. Let the man work his magic, while you marvel at the quick dance of sandwich seduction happening before your eyes. First, a long loaf of Italian bread is sliced open and fresh cured meat after cured meat thinly shaved goes directly into the sandwich. At this point, your mouth is watering as cheeses, peppers, dressing, everything, added so deftly that if you blink you might miss a step. Second, hold your wrapped sandwich tightly in your hands and try not to quiver with excitement at first bite!This mom and pop operation has been serving fantastic Italian sausage, Sub sandwiches and Italian beef for decades. I wouldn't say they have \"the best\" Italian beef in the city, but it is definitely worth trying (even if it is only once).

I find it a challenge to find a place where the beef is of good quality, flavorful, and is not too oily. Al's was way too oily and not flavorful at all.

Lots of mix-matched kitchen stuff, used electronics, plus a few uninteresting antiques were of little interest. \u00a0This store is more picked over than a farmer's market just before closing. \u00a0I saw a few people buying things, but I left with nothing. \u00a0Thrift shopping is hit or miss. \u00a0You never know what you'll find. \u00a0 Although I can't say anything positive about my experience here, several college-aged friends picking through the clothes were obviously very happy with their finds. \u00a0Someone had donated a lot of Banana Republic stuff with the tags still on them. My search will continue, because once you're bitten by the thrift store bug, it's hard to stop. \u00a0I'm posting a picture of my Fendi bag from the Moline Goodwill to inspire my fellow thrift store shopper.UPDATED REVIEW ON 8/20/2015: \u00a0Stopped in a week ago for the first time since my original review last year. \u00a0It's much improved. \u00a0Better organized, cleaner, and the prices were a little more reasonable. \u00a0The salesperson told me they have a new manager. \u00a0I picked up a mid-century ceramic vase for $20... about $15 less than I saw it on Etsy. \u00a0They still need to do better on the pricing, but I'm giving them an extra star for the improvements.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 10, 6]}, "34": {"description": "If I could give this store 0 stars I would!

My wife and I (both Asian) stumbled upon this place when walking on a date night. Entering into the cavernous cement-walled shop we passed by dust and mildew laden furniture that was basting under low-lit halogen bulbs. This Salvation Army is more of a collection of thrown out garbage than a place of well-cared for collectibles.Still as my wife and I were there, wondering if we could find any worthwhile surprises, we turned the first corner of the main room. That was when we heard the raspy voice. \"Take off your bag and purse. You're going to have to give me your bag,\" the larynx-challenged voice said. My wife and I looked to see where the sound was coming from, and then looked at the small brown leather Calvin Klein bag that my wife was wearing. We walked a couple steps forward and heard the raspy entonement: \"Take off your bag and purse and give them to me.\"As we had passed by some of the shoulder high clutter that was piled up in the center of the room, we saw the old employee who had gasped out the words, standing in front of the cash register table. My wife and I looked around to see whom the woman was talking to. From this vantage point a quick visual sweep of the room showed one other shopping husband and wife couple, a mother and daughter, and a single woman. The four female shoppers who'd preceded us into the store all wore larger bags on their backs or hips than the bag that my wife carried. My wife and I approached the clerk to clarify, and the clerk repeated the demand with a stare. Let me take a pause from this narrative to say that I'm not one to say the sky is falling, so this Salvation Army clerk's behavior was really annoying. By simply turning our necks left and right, my wife and I saw four women who had entered before us, sashaying down the aisles with bigger bags swaying in rhythm. I asked the clerk about the other patrons and if she was going to talk to them about their bigger bags. Her immediate response was (and I kid you not): \"Yes, I'm White. I'm going to talk to them, too. I just haven't had a chance to get to them yet.\" Allow me to point out that I'd asked her about the other customers' larger bags and what the clerk planned to do, yet the employee's \u00a0first response was that she's White. Then there's the fact that the other customers had been walking around for minutes before us. \u00a0Stupid is as stupid does.In embarrassment by the blatant racism, the single female shopper who was standing by the register ready to check out, swung her purse from back to front to show how much bigger her purse was than my wife's bag. My wife began taking out our wallets and phones, while the clerk repeated her self admission. Given the store's treatment, \"offerings\", and the spoiling of an until then perfect date night, I asked my wife to repack her bag as I didn't want to stay in the shop any longer. Its incredible that in this day and age, in a large metropolitan city such Chicago, racism still exists.

I had two old and fragile pictures that were family heirlooms - one charcoal drawing of relatives from generations past, one landscape in pastels. All kinds of problems with them - chipped and destroyed moulding, broken frames with loose nails and no structural integrity, dirty old glass that had absorbed the images, wires on the backs that I can't believe held them up for half a century in my grandparents' house, and plenty more.I took them to April 7s and Alex, a manager there, knew exactly what to do with them right away. He examined them closely and pointed out details that I hadn't even noticed before, and laid out clear plans to fix and refresh every issue they had. He also was able to give me a little more background about how they were made, which I found fascinating. Also, the price he quoted me was amazing - I almost couldn't believe it. Huge bargain.They were done in a couple short weeks, and when we went to pick them up I almost couldn't believe my eyes. Wow! First, the backs were all totally new and redone, and as secure and sturdy as I could hope for. Nice new wires and good hooks for the walls. The glass was new too, and good preservation quality with buffers to keep the panes away from the art. The landscape was brighter, more vivid than I'd ever seen it. The frames themselves were still the same material, but strengthened and reinforced, and all the cracks and fractures in the intricate woodwork and claywork were touched up, corrected, and painted to match. They look incredible on my walls.I'd highly recommend April 7s, great experience, great price, great product, great employees too.

The other thing that really irritated me was the portion of the tuna tartare. I am not sure if they give a smaller portion with to-go orders or if this is their norm, but it was SUCH a sad portion size for $14. It was tiny and there was NO tuna in comparison to all the accompaniments. Really a shame. Ordered a ROK bowl that also lacked flavor, maybe this is better in the restaurant?

This place reminded me of a club, but the music wasn't obnoxiously loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. Anyway, even though the ambiance was chill and the staff did their jobs, the true highlight is the sushi. Although it's a little more pricey, it was definitely worth every splurging dime. We ordered a variety of sushi between our little group, and venturing outside of my typical sushi order seemed more accessible and not as scary as it usually seems (in my case).

In May I set up the auto-fill option. Twice now I have gotten calls saying they are ready and when I go in, they are not ready. Fine, but what's the point of the auto-fill calls?

This week (July 7), I was charged for 3 months of pills and received 1, so had to go back.

What ensued was the quickest decline of a bar due to new management that I have ever witnessed.1) A new, smaller menu without the two best things on the old menu -- Irish Poutine and Texas Potatoes. Now, everything is much more generic, run-of-the-mill bar food.2) The Jameson bottles lining the interior of the bar? Gone. So much for personality...3) When the Hawks game came on, it was only on about 4 of the 10 or so TVs. Fine, there was one close enough for me to watch. However, there was music still playing, which would normally be fine, but as an \"Official\" Blackhawks bar, this was not OK. So I politely asked our server if they were going to turn on the sound. She told me she would check .... but alas, I never received an update and the music kept playing... Needless to say, it was time to find a new destination.I don't know what the hell the new management is thinking, but they better get their crap together and fast -- there were maybe only 10 people in the entire bar, where as Twisted Spoke and Aberdeen Tap (where we later ended up) were all crowded.Congratulations Mahoney's -- you have officially lost a bunch of formerly loyal customers due to being worse now than six months ago in pretty much every single way... isn't the idea to improve?", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 10, 15]}, "31": {"description": "Decent bar in an odd location.

In the time that we moved here, we've probably given Mahoney's 3 or 4 chances. The first night there was actually an escape from The Twisted Spoke, and though it was crowded, it was an alright experience.At some point Groupon released a deal for Mahoney's, and I bought one since it was so close-by. But there were many nights when we'd approach the place, see college kids playing bags on the patio, and turn around. We did finally use the Groupon, to a satisfactory experience. However, we just ate there again today, and we decided that'll be the last time. Everything about the visit was awful. First, there was the table of bro-skis (I thought they stayed in Wrigleyville!). They were the worst loud-talkers. Four sales guys off of work gossiping like pigs and guzzling beer- they were the epitome of obnoxious. But, we were hungry so we tried to tune them out.The server was nice enough, but was very awkward and often lingered after a decision was made on food or drinks. I got cheeseburger sliders. Or so I thought. They looked more like burgers they accidentally put cheese on. Pretty pathetic-looking sliders. After this, we'd had it and just wanted to leave, so we offered up our credit card. The server disappeared for about 10 minutes and finally came back saying their system was currently down. She continued to inform us they were re-booting the system, and they'd try swiping the card again in a few minutes. Or we could use their ATM to get cash (for a fee, of course). Though our table neighbors were getting rowdier, we decided to wait a little longer. But another 5 minutes was all we could take. We started our way over to the ATM, when the server stopped us with the receipt- it finally went through. And just in time. Our frustration level with Mahoney's was just about at its breaking point.On our way out we noticed a sign we had never seen before- a courtesy sign asking patrons to:-please leave quietly- respect the neighborsAND.... - don't pee in the alley.

But instead of a decent experience we ended up with a terrible one...We waited at least 25 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us once we sat down. Oh wait, I'm sorry, this was after the bartender shouted at us from across the room that we'd need to come up to the bar to order from her. By the time we were finally acknowledged by a waitress and received our food it was around 11pm - ridiculous! I think the waitress maybe checked on us once while we were eating - the second time she came over was to literally drop the condiments on the table - as in, she threw them down on the table, said nothing and then walked away. Then there was the 25-30 minute wait to get our check, which may I add: involved me having to track the waitress down across the bar to give her our credit cards because she was so inattentive.By the time the whole ordeal was over it was around 11:45pm - two hours after we arrived. I asked to speak with the manager and explained our frustrations with the extremely slow service and the unapologetic waitress who rarely checked on us in our 2-hour stay. The \"manager,\" who was by no means an actual manager, was also completely unapologetic and said, \"OK I'll be right back\" in his unapologetic Australian accent. He then went over to the DJ who I'm assuming was the real manager (what?!?!) and spoke with him for awhile before coming back and offering to adjust our checks. There was no explanation or apology involved. Sure, I appreciate the $20 taken off of the check but an apology might have gotten me to come back in the future.Instead, I will never be back.

The Twisted Spoke is directly south on Ogden, and Matchbox is less than 1/4 mile north on Ogden. Both of those places have better service, a better selection of craft beer and spirits, and the Spoke has far superior food. The only reason that I found myself at Mahoney's is because I don't have cable and I wanted to watch an out of market NFL game. Mahoney's has the NFL Sunday Ticket.Mahoney's is totally Vanilla. It's an unoffensive Irish Pub with a whole bunch of finished Jamison bottles adorning all of the open shelf space in their main room. The food is below average, but safe. I had a humus/veggie plate and a some Buffalo Chicken tenders. I ordered the humus because I was on a date and wanted to show that I'm worldly and into weird foods from other countries, the Buffalo Chicken was ordered to show that I'm from the street and like to keep things hot. Neither mattered because my Dawgs, the Cleveland Browns were on and my total lack of attention to my date really piqued her interest.The service was below average. I'm convinced that the open-mouth breather that was waiting on us was a zombie.

But they also had pickles, carrots, celery, ham and cheddar cheese cubes. NICE!As for the food: I enjoyed an incredibly tasty and greasy (the good, delicious kind) grilled cheese sandwich that came with yummy, creamy tomato soup for dipping (I'm drooling thinking about it right now) and to aid my gluttony, I went nuts and ordered a \u00a0large plate of fries as well. Everything was tasty. And I'm pretty sure it wasn't because I was ravenous and did I mention VERY hungover? I really like the space. First of all, it was huge on the inside, lots of TVs and the best part was the crap ton of empty Jameson bottles all over - even on the chandeliers! They also had a stage and I believe they have music/DJs and dancing going on at night. It was a bit loud with the music and distracting with all the TVs showing some unimportant sporting event (college basketball??? hahaha, don't be mad, I like DA BULLS) because the Hawks weren't on yet.

There are bar stools at all the windows and their counters even have purse/jacket hooks underneath! \u00a0You will see shelves of pour over contraptions with names like kalita wave, stacked alongside beakers, kettles, scales and timers.To go with my coffee, I also ordered a Basque pastry (like a petit madeleine in the shape of a tart, dusted with powdered sugar) and those run about $4.00. \u00a0It was exceptionally good. \u00a0If I hadn't gotten a dark roast coffee, I would have ordered their Cardamom Latte. \u00a0A friend (also with the Indie Coffee Passport) had raved about the Marshmallow Latte that comes with a toasted marshmallow.It has been awhile since I've given five stars to a cafe, but both their coffee/staff top the list in the coffee world and are nothing short of wonderful.", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 3, 2]}, "2": {"description": "My friend and I decided to stop in Big Shoulders Coffee before dinner one night. \u00a0This place is not your fancy coffee shop and doesn't offer many options, but everyone is friendly and their options are truly unique. \u00a0My friend tried the marshmallow latte and I opted for the horchata latte. \u00a0For my lactose intolerant friends, they do offer other choices of milk: soy or almond. \u00a0The flavor of my latte was delicious. \u00a0It truly embraced the flavors of a horchata while still having the rich aromas of coffee. \u00a0It was a tad sweet for my liking, but nothing asking for less sugar (or even no sugar) won't help with. \u00a0Overall, this is a great place to sit and enjoy your cup of coffee or on the go in a hurry. \u00a0It's conveniently located steps away from the blue line. \u00a0Definitely go grab yourself a cup.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 21]}, "18": {"description": "Every once in a while the coffee truck parks in front of the Deloitte building on Monroe and Wacker.

The same range goes for the liquor collection, and while you won't find any haut couture, i.e., boutique flavored vodkas, you'll see an eclectic mix of whisk(e)y, bourbon, and vodkas. \u00a0And how could I forget that on Tuesday evenings, you can get the poor man's boilermaker for 4$ featuring Beam and the BEAST?! \u00a0I should also mention that they have Blatz in cans, which is rare(r) now in Chicago. \u00a0Price: 4 out of 5As someone has mentioned already, it's cheap but not THAT cheap. \u00a02.50 for a Hamm's draft, 2 bucks for a can of Blatz. \u00a0Not breaking the bank by any means, but not quite liquor store singles cheap. \u00a0I'm not in tune to what the specials are each evening yet, but 4 $ for a Beam and Beast seems reasonable, and I imagine that much entertainment can arise from watching the over consumption of such options. \u00a0Remember that this place is cash only, though an ATM is available.Customer Service: 4 out of 5Friendly guy behind the bar who made small talk well. \u00a0Didn't get into any deep conversations about life, love lost, dogs, politics, corruption, etc. but it doesn't mean that we won't get there one day. \u00a0For my first visit - talking about Hamm's, the beer refreshing! and Blatz was a good introduction to this bar.Overall: 4 out of 5Worth a visit if you're in the area, and I'll gladly go back to drink old school beers in peace, make small talk with the barkeeps, and hopefully watch and observe the shenaniganry that inevitably accompanies 4$ shots and beer combos. \u00a0Keep it classy, keep it safe, and remember that you can bring in your own food (or have it delivered).", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 7, 23]}, "5": {"description": "I like my dive bars like I like my police drawings...sketchy.

Because I've literally never encountered a single sushi restaurant in my 27 years of eating sushi that served a non-tempura sweet potato roll. So... I'm pretty sure they cooked my sweet potato in the toaster oven, and it was still quite raw (yuck!), and still had a bunch of the really tough skin on it.

We decided to go with that and I was surprised that the dishes weren't larger to accommodate four people. Some of the things that came out had less than four items on the plate so we all had to kind of cut everything in half and get a bite here and there. It wasn't the worst experience and in the end I was able to get enough to eat. I just feel that if they are going to suggest sharing, it should be served for sharing. I like this restaurant because I was able to try a lot of new things that aren't as common at other places like elk sausage and alligator. I have to say that the duck tacos and elk sausage were my absolute favorites. Very flavorful and definitely something to come back for. I would also like to try ordering a whole pig sometime if we ever have a large party. The women's bathroom is terrible though. The stall doors are very high off the ground and very, very close to the toilet. My knees were almost touching the door when I closed it and the bottom of the door was almost up to my lap. It was a very uncomfortable situation and I don't recommend using the bathroom. The valet was also not that great. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night and there was absolutely no street parking around the whole block.

But when we confirmed with the owner/manager, he said it was only good for up to $50 off. So fine, we will choose another option.

We then asked to speak to the owner who proceeded to tell us that this voucher was not even honored to begin with and said that the waitress had informed us of this which was not the case. He proceeded to tell us that he \"did us a favor\" and \"deducted $35 from our bill even though they didn't honor the voucher\". The owner kept cutting us off when we tried to explain that this was not told to us. Because had we known this, we would have not ordered and ate at this establishment.

Tonkotsu Ramen was okay it wasn't that tasty in my opinion. I the pork belly in it tasted good. I felt it was more of a Chinese take on ramen.The Teriyaki plate dinner was a negative on so many levels. First the person who took our order didn't even ask how we wanted the steak to be cooked. She just asked the chef to make it medium. For us that is a total negative because we always like our steak medium rare bc we don't like hard steak. The steak looked to me like it was boiled it didn't look like it had any kind of searing done to it. It was on a plate with two or three pieces of broccoli some kind of carrot garnish and teriyaki sauce. Oh, and a bowl of rice on the side. The plate came with one bowl of miso soup which was just okay.We couldn't enjoy the steak it was so sad! Also If we go to other Japanese restaurant for a $20 N.Y stripe steak it should be really good am I right? I would prefer teriyaki beef over un-edible steak. For $20 they should've added more flare to the plate, perhaps some tempura and instead of rice mebbe a bento box with some sushi too.

I decided to try it because of the good yelp ratings and was very disappointed by all three visits.The first time, a saw a stylist who is no longer there. She was very professional and the cut was ok, though not really what I asked for. It was difficult to style and did nothing for me.I came back and saw the owner. I have a lot of hair and specifically asked him to remove a lot of the weight. He refused to do that and instead gave me lots of awkward layers that just accentuated the thickness of my hair in all the wrong places. I came back once more, and this time his attempt at removing weight left me with a poofy shelf halfway up my hair that I spent months growing out and having another stylist fix. It seems there is just a lack of technique and understanding of how to manipulate different hair types.On top of this, both haircuts with the owner left a chunk or two longer than the rest of the hair that I had to fix when I got home. I understand that mistakes happen, but at this price point I expect at least the basics to be done right.The experience left something to be desired as the owner kept gossiping about former employees.

Since my last horror experience, I hadn't done anything to my hair for two years. A few days ago, I decided I wanted to try highlights and based on the yelp reviews, requested an appointment through their website. They responded very promptly (2 business hours) and I came in the next day. As soon as I arrived, I was seated instantly and began consulting with Allison about what kind of highlights I wanted. I came in with the vague idea of ash-toned highlights but I had no examples (not even any pictures), and I wasn't even sure whether that's what I actually wanted. Basically, I was the difficult customer who is picky but doesn't know what she wants. Allison recommended warmer, dark caramel highlights (I'm a brunette) because it didn't require bleaching and was less of a hassle for first-time highlights. I didn't want my hair to look too brassy, but she sounded like she knew what she was talking about so I let her do her thing. On a side note, she's pretty attuned to people. I was exhausted so, while I had a few questions, I was quiet almost the entire time and it didn't feel awkward. She seems like the type to happily talk to you the entire time if you'd like or just leave you to your thoughts. Two hours later, I was handed off to Mila who was very friendly and talkative. (Bonus: She speaks Russian!) I told her that I was trying to grow my hair out and to please PLEASE for the love of god not to cut off more than, like, half an inch. Even though she would have preferred to take off an inch because of the split ends, this girl is the first person in years who LISTENED and did exactly as I asked! And she's not the type to insist because she actually suggested I get layers at first (I agreed as long as she kept the longest layer actually long) but then changed her mind because my hair was a bit too thin on the ends. It's nice to know my hairdresser doesn't have itchy fingers to cut cut cut. She also gave me tips on how to keep my hair more hydrated. Final thoughts: The highlights look really nice and natural like I wanted. I should have gone with the ash-toned ones though because that's what I came in wanting. However, for my first time, I'm glad I listened to Allison and went with the warmer tones. It would have taken even longer with the bleach and I wasn't ready for that. Besides, I've gotten multiple compliments since I left. Mila listened to me and didn't cut off more than I wanted which puts her at the top automatically, hands down.They're definitely pricey but what's great is that on their website, they have full highlights listed as $150+ so I assumed they'd charge me more since I have long hair but no, it was $150 on the dot. My trim and blow-dry/straightening was $55 (which reflects what their website says). In all, I was expecting to spend way more than $205 pre-tip so I was pleasantly surprised.

He explained that it may not be as smooth when I wore it straight, but I was willing to take that risk. And a couple days later, when I tried it straight, it was perfect.

I have a lot of hair and specifically asked him to remove a lot of the weight. He refused to do that and instead gave me lots of awkward layers that just accentuated the thickness of my hair in all the wrong places. I came back once more, and this time his attempt at removing weight left me with a poofy shelf halfway up my hair that I spent months growing out and having another stylist fix. It seems there is just a lack of technique and understanding of how to manipulate different hair types.On top of this, both haircuts with the owner left a chunk or two longer than the rest of the hair that I had to fix when I got home. I understand that mistakes happen, but at this price point I expect at least the basics to be done right.The experience left something to be desired as the owner kept gossiping about former employees.

I also think many shoppers make this mistake at larger corporations which require membership fees to even make a purchase. Right there, the $30/$50 you spend can be divided and added to the items you purchase over the year, and pretty much you come out even going anywhere else. I definitely have a limited income, and I secretly laugh at my friends who take me to these membership corporations, thinking they are doing me a favor. I watch them purchase items which are well over priced, or the same as anywhere else. My visits to Stanley's (I have been here more than what my 2 check-ins reflect) are always hit or miss. Stanley's has had the best sale on asparagus I have ever seen at a produce market. Of course, this was last summer, and I am pretty sure it was during the asparagus season. Yes, for those shoppers who are not familiar with when produce is seasonal, you're really doing yourself a disservice and you need to do some research. When produce is in season, this means the pricing will come down. I hate cooking with a passion. If I am going to spend money on food, it better be a good deal. Typically I go with friends. I am usually aghast with what deals my culinary arts friends pass over. How can you be in the industry and not know a good deal when you see it? My last visit, I was alone, thank goodness, and decided to give this market a thorough investigation. Really, I was not impressed. Apples, like Danny W. had brought up, were priced much like a major chain would price out theirs. One of my health tricks is making sure I have apples. First, it takes more calories to burn off an apple, than the calories found in an apple. Second, I always eat an apple with a fatty meal because it slows down absorption of the fat into your system. Bottom line, I am always watching prices on apples. What I did notice was that Stanley's had a deli. Not even advertised as a sale, their lunchmeat was reasonably priced, even the roast beef! I also noticed their hummus was a decent price, if not typical, but I had never come across some of the flavors I found here. I can't wait to try the horseradish hummus! I got the last container so it must be a hot seller. You may not find prices that seduce you, however, I am always impressed with the quality of their produce. Far beyond that of a major chain or any grocery store in Chicago (what is it with grocery stores in the city? Gross! Even the ones closest to the Gold Coast), Stanley's will always have produce which doesn't look like it has been bathed in pesticides... even if it has; or even if some of the produce has started to go bad. It still looks fresh and like a healthy decay. Like I have said, my beef with Stanley's would be their lack of consistently offering good deals on all of their produce. If you don't know your way around fruits and vegetables, then you're not going to come out ahead shopping here. I'm probably not doing myself much of a favor by driving all the way out to Skokie to shop, but I think it's worth the cost in gas just to encourage the Euro Markets to keep delivering fresh produce at an affordable price.

They're flexible and last without chipping or peeling for almost 3 weeks, even with as hard as I am on my hands (I can't break the bad habit of using my nails like tools)!My tips for folks thinking about getting the No Chip Gel Lacquer:-be ready to pay $45 plus tip for the service (worth every penny)-The lightest colors can sometimes get stained by clothing dyes (think if your nails rub against your dark blue jeans) and start to look dingy.-I wouldn't recommend attempting to remove them on your own; it's worth paying for Revive to do a \"soak off\" before your next manicure-Nail art can be done with the gel lacquer. I've had French tips and half moons.-Gel Lacquer works well on long or short nails and especially pointy stiletto nails.Similar to what Cara Y. wrote below, I live no where near Revive but it's well worth the trip.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 1, 16]}, "38": {"description": "Revive Nails is the best nail salon in the city!

Left feeling frustrated and not relaxed at all. Pros:Ileana did a great job on my no chip mani. The quality of both my nails and toes was very good, which is the only reason I am giving 3 stars. Cons:Entire service took 2 hours and 15 min. Longest nail service of my life to date. This wouldn't be such a con if the rest of the experience was enjoyable. Soak-off of my old no-chip polish took 55 minutes for both fingers and toes, at my usual spot it takes 10, max. No exaggeration. They also charged $6 for the soak off service, which I have never experienced before. It's always been complimentary when you are getting another main/pedi to replace it, both of which I got.The guy doing it (didn't introduce himself) seemed frustrated that he had to do the soak off. Suggested that I shouldn't get no-chips on my toes because the regular polish lasts just as long. My no-chip was 7 weeks old, so I nicely said that wasn't the case for me, and explained that I danced was on my feet all the time. Thought it was strange that he was talking-down a more expensive service. The same guy also kept asking the tech next to him to do both my manicure and pedicure, (under his breath like I wouldn't hear him) and I felt so awkward sitting there, as he kept trying to pass me off. I should mention that I DID make an appointment, but I felt shuffled around like an annoying walk in. The salon wasn't even busy - there were only 3 techs working when I arrived - but the woman on the phone said appointments were preferred, that there's almost always a long wait for walk-ins etc.The guy did end up doing my toes and did good work, but didn't want to put my silver sparkle straight on my toes. He insisted on a silver base polish, to which I said fine, but he just put one coat of the sparkle...so really my nails just look silver, with a very faint sparkle, not the glittery look I was going for.The tech didn't talk to me much at all (this is okay, but at least ask me how I am, how my day is going, etc. or notice that I am a new client, ask me if I live in the area, etc. - these quick interactions make your clients feel at home and WANTED/WELCOME.) He did however discus other salons and pay rates elsewhere with a fellow nail tech, who tips well, etc. Felt awkward having them discuss other places in front of me - as if they were both unhappy with the jobs they were currently at/doing.The woman next to me was offered something to drink right away. My guy offered me nothing, and left me sitting for what he said would be 5 minutes and was definitely 15. (Ileana did offer me a drink when I sat down with her for the mani - thank you. The tea was really good. Just would have liked the same from the other tech who did my toes.)SO MUCH confusion over what service I wanted. Went in for an early-bird special - $58 for a no chip mani and regular (standard) pedi. I said this on the phone, but when I arrived they thought I wanted an organic pedicure/manicure. After we sorted out the confusion (caught some eye-rolling from the woman at the front desk), I still had to clarify with the techs. I think this was the start of the one male tech trying to pass me off to Ileana.I tipped in cash and went up to settle my balance and the front desk woman was again confused about my service. She seemed confused about the special I went in for, and I had to pull it up on the website to confirm. She was then charging me $9 for the soak off when it should have been $6 ($3 for fingers $3 for toes). She was nice about it, and we settled on the correct amount, but it was all too much. Should have been a simple transaction. I too am in customer service, and feel the atmosphere and overall experience here was just really lacking. The decor is so warm and inviting but the staff seems lackluster at best. Again, props to Ileana, she was the nicest one I encountered, but even she seemed less than thrilled to be there. Over 2 hours, I had nowhere to be and I just couldn't relax. I may try them again, but not before trying other shops in the area first. If I do go back, I'll ask for Ileana specifically, and maybe call a day or two ahead of time.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 10, 20]}, "30": {"description": "I have been going to Vanessa for almost a year and won't go anywhere else.

The massage chair had a buttocks option, and this portion did not work. It seemed like a lot of the buttons on the remote were unresponsive. I saw a water dispenser... Wasn't offered water. Pedi-tub water was hardly even lukewarm. Nicki was my tech... Appropriate in skill, for the most part. No problems with polish application... But she cut my nails too short. I had two broken nails on my R index and R middle.. And I just wanted the rest shortened slightly so it would blend. All my nails ended up quite short, with my fingertip pads visible beneath the tip of the nail. Hate that. She set me at the drying station and didn't turn any of the driers on before leaving. Asked the receptionist for help. She had placed my phone away in my purse, and the drying station faces outside. No magazines, music, or TV to distract, risking polish injury. \u00a0After the pedi, she should have asked me to pull my leggings down to my ankles. I didn't realize this was missed until after I was done at the drying station, so \u00a0I risked polish smudging again, trying to pull my leggings down over my calves. Small things... But these all added up. I've got a hefty collection of polish at home, so spending on a spa treatment with little hospitality just didn't sit well with me. This is a spot I wouldn't revisit...

The result, as you can see from the pictures, is embarrassing. The no chip is peeling from the raw cuticle and you can clearly see where the acrylic ends. They look so much worse than they did before I came in today! Some of the polish had worn off, sure, but it didn't look like my cuticles were bleeding.

It is part of the teacher's job to ensure that EVERYONE is benefiting from the class. \u00a0When a child is throwing around toys (which are not allowed to be brought into the class by families for obvious reasons) or a tantrum in the middle of a class, the child is distracting other children from focusing on the music and learning experience. \u00a0This is not to say that this is the child's fault. \u00a0S/he is, of course, only 2 (or 1 or whatever). One simple thing is to take a child out of the room, calm them down, and then bring them back. \u00a0I have had to do it myself because I know it is not fair for the other kids to watch my child throw a tantrum for a class that their parents are paying for. \u00a0I have seen other parents do the same out of consideration and respect for the teacher, the children, and their parents. \u00a0I find it hard to believe that a teacher would ask a parent to give a time out for just throwing a toy once. \u00a0Based on my experience as an educator, there is usually a lot more to the story. \u00a0Was it the first time? \u00a0Was it excessively hard?

However, now is the perfect time to teach children that throwing instruments is unacceptable as is throwing a vase in your house. \u00a0Once again, discipline does not equal being unreasonable or mean.These teachers are the exact opposite of mean and unkind and to imply otherwise offends me for them. \u00a0That said, these classes are a lot of fun for my kids.

She listened to my entire shpiel, asked me questions, and then laid it out for me - what kind of hair digital perms are for (they're actually for people with straight hair), what another perm would do for me, and how a keratin treatment would improve my hair health, shine, and frizz (especially since the warm weather is approaching). This was ALL before we even got started. Brittany took her time on EVERYTHING, stayed late after closing hours to make sure my haircut was perfect after the keratin was done, and was an amazing stylist. I was looking to cut my hair primping time in half - since I have a lot of hair, it can take me over an hour to do my hair everyday before work. So Brittany suggested the keratin treatment, because it takes all the time I spend blow drying, out of the equation, and I can still curl and style my hair when the keratin loosens up. It hasn't been 24 hours yet and my entire office has told me how amazing my hair looks. Kala salon was recommended to me by another salon, after I had a consultation with them and scheduled an appointment, they called me a week later to tell me they didn't feel comfortable performing my perm, but told me to call Kala, because they are the best.

I decided on Kala Salon and I am so happy that I did!Brittany gave me an amazing cut! My hair is semi-damaged from extensions, straightening and coloring. However, I left Brittany's chair with my hair feeling healthy, looking shiny and feeling great! I hate when hair dressers do what they want with your hair, despite you telling them what you want. I showed Brittany some pictures of the style I wanted and she gave me exactly that!!! Brittany was friendly and personable - but not overly intrusive like hair dressers have the image of being. She also is very knowledgable and tells you, as her client, little tips and products she would recommend that won't break your budget. The salon is cute, comfortable and in a good location - very modern feel. Everyone there was friendly and professional. I would recommend Brittany to ANYONE!

As you can tell with my previous reviews, I treasure this part of my dining experience. The menu is vast and there are a ton of options for whatever you are in the mood for. The ingredients are extremely fresh which result in very high quality dishes. Speaking of. We ordered the Chef's Flatbread with seasonal ingredients. I mean who doesn't like to play a little russian roulette with their flatbread now and again? It arrived with the perfect amount of spinach and goat cheese and olive oil. Simple and delicious. The crust was thin and it was the perfect amount for two people to share. Winner. Then we tried the flash fried calamari. Try saying that fast five times. Either way, get it because it comes with an orange glaze that will make you want to tilt your head back and drink it. The dish was hot and crispy and not oily which is a huge deal for me, given that I am such a calamari critic. Next came the house parmesan gnocchi made with mixed herb and pistachio pesto and it was absolutely divine. It was not a heavy dish at all, like with most gnocchi dishes and the fresh pesto was seasoned to perfection. We loved this dish and would definitely have this again. We decided to skip dessert as we were really full. It was probably a good idea because if we did order dessert, we would have probably opted for a steak. Yes everything was THAT good. Side note: We did order the ribeye previously and it would make a grown man cry. Essentially, this restaurant is a gem and we will be going back there for sure. Decent prices for the quality of the menu and service and the corkage fee was not bad either. \u00a0I will admit, I was torn about posting this review as we would like to keep this place a secret but we all know the world does not work like that.

We decided to skip dessert as we were really full. It was probably a good idea because if we did order dessert, we would have probably opted for a steak. Yes everything was THAT good. Side note: We did order the ribeye previously and it would make a grown man cry. Essentially, this restaurant is a gem and we will be going back there for sure. Decent prices for the quality of the menu and service and the corkage fee was not bad either. \u00a0I will admit, I was torn about posting this review as we would like to keep this place a secret but we all know the world does not work like that.

Given that it is a very popular tour, I thought it may be worth to see what the rave is about. However, after experiencing the tour, I have to say that it definitely did not live up to my expectations - particularly for self-proclaimed foodies. First of all, the walking-tour included in this was excellent. It's a good and convenient way to see the downtown attractions, learn about the history of Chicago and meet some out of town new faces. The tour guide was friendly, personable, and provided some nice details about the city of Chicago. This aspect of the tour is what I enjoyed particularly the most. As for the food sampling part, I didn't think it was sufficient enough. Many of the places we went to were pretty generic, it might've been more worthwhile to have just visited one or two of the restaurants yourself and enjoy a full course meal for the $50 that you paid for. Part of my tour included the Chicago Style hot dog at Halsted Deli and deep dish pizza at Pizano's. What you should do instead is to go try Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and Chicago Dog's House (hot-dogs) -- it's cheaper and taste just as good, if not better. \u00a0Also, a lot of these places are quite close by, given that Chicago is such a convenient place to commute by foot, I have no doubt that you can find these places yourself if you're willing to spend the time to do the research and walk. Overall, my observation is this:The tour is good if you want to just meet your most basic tourist needs; it's general and basic, but won't delve more into that (food-wise). If you're a foodie and you are looking to try something outside of the box, you definitely should just stick to what you do best, because chances are this won't be enough to satisfy you.

I had to kill time because I followed the (erroneous) note to show up an hour early instead of only fifteen minutes early, but it was nice to chat with Yelpers old and new with the down time. Our tour guide was Lynn, who is also the owner of TTC. The goal is for participants to enjoy a walking buffet of \"Chicago\" foods while also getting a taste of not only the foods but the history and behind-the-scenes anecdotes supporting the dishes. While we stopped mostly at dining establishments, we also walked by and through significant historical places and landmarks (Drake Hotel, Water Tower Pumping Station, John Hancock Center). Yes - this is a WALKING tour so be ready to do a healthy amount of walking, rain or shine. Besides, you can walk off the calories that you will consume on the tour. \u00a0The first stop of the Magnificent Mile tour is at Pizano's Pizza on State (there is also another parallel tour that covers the Loop and Millennium Park areas). While Pizano's may not be as famous as some of the other Chicago-style pizza establishments, it has a rich family history that gives it \"cred\" in the deep-dish game. We all tried some thin-crust and deep-dish pizza, and its crackling crust does the trick for me. We spent some quality time at Pizano's, also in part because this is the first stop so there was time needed to set the ground rules and expectations (water provided at most stops! bathroom breaks along the way! pay attention when walking outside!). Next was Sarah's, a chic pastry shop on Oak Street. This was the shortest stop, barely longer than the time needed to inhale the fudgy brownie sample bite provided to us. Next was Downtown Dogs, where most of us ate the \"typical\" Chicago-style dog with all the standard trimmings. This was a regulation-size hot dog, so it certainly brought my stomach to the point of satisfaction at halftime. This ain't Hot Doug's, but it certainly does well as your typical Chicago dog. \u00a0Next we went to Heaven on Seven, which in this case is on the second floor (unlike the original location on Wabash, which is actually on the seventh floor). They still have the wall of hot sauce bottles here at this location, along with a see-through kitchen. We enjoyed our beans and rice and jambalaya samples (yes you get shrimp here even in the little samples, no skimping here). A couple of our braver participants tried Da Bomb hot sauce (supposedly the hottest topper amongst their zillions of bottles), and therefore provided a bit of comic relief after a teeny bit of the sauce was consumed. The tour then goes underground to the Billy Goat, a tourist dive if there ever was one. While the half-burger and \"gruff service\" sideshow may actually put off some people, I actually liked my burger sample. The final stop is at the Purple Pig, a surprising entry when compared with the more typical and touristy places on the list. The Pig may be more trendy than touristy, but it is a hit with our group thanks to the pleasing interiors and the tasty samples of soft gelato (cappuccino) and assorted cookies. If we had not eaten so much already, this would be a great place to linger and eat more food! \u00a0 \u00a0It was interesting to run into other \"rival\" tours along the way (pizza, chocolates etc), so one can see Tastebud Tours becoming a long-run success. It's not just an eating tour but also a spirited 3+ hour walking tour featuring history and architecture, so once can justify the $44 cost of the tour when you factor everything into the mix (there are currently online discounts available).

We are huge foodies from NY and my friend has her own food blog. At the end of the tour my friend said to me, \"this was a waste of my time and money\". I felt terrible because I made the recommendation. The first stop of the tour was Pizano's Pizza for dip dish pizza. The pizza itself was OK. Several people on the tour were from Chicago and mentioned they had better pizza. There was a terrible smell outside the establishment. It reeked of dirty gutters and pee. I know this is not the fault of the tour but this environment is definitely not conducive for eating pizza. Several people commented on the stench. Thankfully we ate inside. \u00a0For the next two hours of the tour (I kid you not) we visited notable places in Chicago, such as the Millenium park, Cultural Center, and famous hotels. At this point we had taken a walking tour of Chicago and were really looking to sample the food. This was not useful for us. At this point I was starving because I did not eat breakfast. We finally had a hot dog at a place attached to a Popeyes, and headed to \"Sugar Bliss\" for a cupcake. The cupcake was delicious and I would recommend this bakery. However, we should be able to select the type of cupcake, instead of just chocolate. What if someone does not like chocolate or prefer vanilla/red velvet? We then went to a New Orleans themed restaurant in an office building called \"Heaven on Seven\". The food was OK but the restaurant was not my cup of tea. We then toured the city some more and ended at a subpar German restaurant. \u00a0Overall I would not do this tour again or recommend it. The food is subpar, the tour is extremely long but most of the time is spent on the history of Chicago. We were limited to one each of everything and didn't have a choice on what flavors to sample.

This is was due to my first food tour with TASTEBUD Food Tour, that was GREAT TASTING AND A BUNCH OF FILLING YUMMY FOOD!!! I say first food tour with Tastebud's because since November 2011, I've been on 3 food tours through their company and have LOVED each one! I went in November 2010 to Flavors of Chicago, we went with three adults and two teenagers (one vegetarian), and all of us LOVED it and couldnt move after the tour due to so much yummy food! The second best part of the food tour, other then the BEST food, is the tour guide's energetic and educated history of the city/area your touring! You cant beat $44 for a three hour tour that you get not only the history of the beautiful city but all the yummy food from the city too! That's a deal that keeps me coming back for more, and searching for other food tours as Tastebud, when I travel now! I traveled recently to the east coast, New York, Philly, Washington DC, and Miami...no Tastebuds:( but I was able to find a food tour in NYC (August 2011), and although it was good, it def didnt meet the standards of Tastebud's...which made me realize that Tastebuds had set the food tour standards HIGH, with their prices, coverage of tour area, food they offered on tour, and tour guide history and energy!!

Both tours are hard to choose from...Billy Goats was very cool...and the Loop area was cool too...try both!Now three weeks later, I'm looking online for a food tour for New Orleans, because that's where I'd be traveling next and I found with excitement Tastebud Food Tours had just started up in New Orleans!! Now New Orleans is ALL about the BEST FOOD, MUSIC, AND DRINKS!! So the bar was set HIGH for the first real food tour for the amazing city! There's culinary classes...but seriously I want to eat, not cook!!! lol I viewed with excitement the places we'd eat and the food we'd try...I was impressed, although I had been to New Orleans before and tried a lot of food, I was excited to hear the history and try the food again! \u00a0And the prices for New Orleans and Chicago were the same, and I can't beat that deal!! \u00a0Just so happens my father and I attended the FIRST kickoff Food Tour for Tastebud in New Orleans on 11/12/11. \u00a0We even had the pleasure of meeting the genuis who created Tastebud's, and I got to share that I LOVED his tours, tour guides, food picks for tour, and the history that was given at all three tours I had been on. \u00a0I also expressed a thank you for opening me up to food tours as a must do when I travel! \u00a0And although I had been to New Orleans before and ate like crazy, this tour took me to places I'd hadn't been and gave us of COURSE an abundant amount of YUMMY food and history of the tour area!! I can't recommend enough a TASTEBUD Food Tour, whether its in Chicago or New Orleans, as well as other cities when traveling...BUT you will not find the nicest price, fullest tummy of the yummiest food, and best tour guides with the most knowledge of the city's history and the food your eating on the tour!!! \u00a0I'm glad to have been apart of the kick off and be able to tell the owner himself what a fantastic idea and company he created. \u00a0If your a food LOVER go on this TOUR!!!", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 11, 27]}, "52": {"description": "My girlfriends and I went on the Tastebud Tour during our first visit to Chicago and were pretty impressed with the mix of city and food attractions.

We were told this is home to the world famous deep dish pizzas - boy that was true! The pizza was so good, we went BACK for dinner that evening. Then we made a stop to The Drake Hotel for some historic background and to visit the powder room. After we visited a former place for Sarah's Pastries for a traditional brownie. Then it was to Downtown Dogs, where I first encountered a Chicago Dog. I have to say, that I would have never gone out of my way to eat such a trashcan food item..... However, I was very mistaken once that treasure hit my taste buds. A perfect combination and I must admit, I'm a fan!!! Heaven on Seven, it was a nice Louisiana style restaurant with a wall full of hot sauces (over 2,000) my dish tasted better with the hot sauces I added, it really made the meal pop! When I visited the Billy Goat Tavern, I was not impressed. Great history behind the foundation of the tavern but we went for a cheeseburger and it was just that..... A cheeseburger. Nothing special about it. Finally the last leg of the tour brought us 23 floors up to the Tip Top Tap Allerton Hotel. We had some decent chocolate chip cheesecake, but the dining setting was beautiful and the history tour was great.All in all, the tour lasted roughly 3 hours and we had a blast! It's an awesome experience whether you're a Chicago native, or visiting. I definitely recommend you give it a try because it takes you for a tour outside your comfort zone! They really do take you to great \"hidden\" places that you normally might not have found. The price was good for having a guide escort you around town and take you straight to all your destinations.The walking made it easier to fit more food in too!", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 2, 19]}, "15": {"description": "I am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this tour with some other Yelpers. Let me just say that I have tried A LOT of food tours (both Chicago Food Planet neighborhood tours and TWO chocolate neighborhood tours) and this one ranks up there in the top! \u00a0Out of all the tours I've done, I learned the most of Chicago history here. We not only stopped off at food locations but also at historic landmarks (i.e. The Drake hotel).It was a rainy AND windy Chicago Sunday, but despite the weather I had an awesome time! Lynn did a really great job with our tour and handled the weather situation without difficulty. What a great easy going guy!We visited:--Pizano's Pizza (I may have found my new favorite pizza spot. The deep dish and thin crust pizza were delicious! I am still trying to figure out how they get that crust so crispy!)--Sarah's (The brownie was definitely good...I've never met a bad brownie, but it was not the best I've had)--Downtown Dog's (Good Chicago hot dog--stay away from those peppers!)--Heaven on Seven (The gumbo was really delicious! I may have to come back to try more food!)--Billy Goat Tavern & Grill (I've lived in Chicago for over 4 years and FINALLY made it to this place! Sadly, the cheeseburger was not good. But I enjoyed learning about the history of the Original Tavern and the Billy Goat. Definitely a Chicago tourist spot to visit, if not eat at)--The Purple Pig (I've been wanting to check this place out too!!! That strawberry ice cream IS DELICIOUS!!!!! It tasted like something from my childhood!!! Very nostalgic for me! The outdoor seating was very nice!I enjoyed visiting ALL the locations on our tour, but my favorite EATERIES were Pizano's, Heaven on Seven, and The Purple Pig.For $44 you definitely get your money's worth if not more. The tour guarantees enough for lunch, but I can tell you that you'll be filled up for dinner too!! LOTS OF FOOD to keep you full. I started cramping towards the end from eating so much!!Just a note for those that decide to come, I recommend NOT driving. Your parking meter will expire. The tour is longer than 2 hours and the tour does not end where it begins. Also, the tour is designed for sit down dining so that you will always have a nice comfortable seat and a nice ICE cold drink (so you're not drinking the warm water you've been carrying around). \u00a0The tour is NOT rushed at all which I enjoyed A LOT. You can also shop during the tour stops too, which many food tours don't allow. The duration of my tour was from 11am to 2:45pm. I recommend keeping your schedule for the entire day open so that you don't feel rushed to get somewhere else.

Mind me, I went there with hair past shoulder lenght, 15 inches. I ended up with yucky 3 inches layers on top, and the rest of my hair 5-6 inches longAlso, she chopped off more on side than another. The haicut doesn't even remotely resemble the one she herself recommended.It wouldn't have been so bad had she kept the lenght longer, as I told her, around jaw line. Mid me, I went there with hair shoulder lenght, so she had plenty to satisfiy her uncontrollable cuttning frenzy and still keep it medium lenght.What is particularily maddening in this whole experience, is that after the job was done she asked me: do you like it? I did not answer; I was speachless processing how can you just chop off a year of hair growth with no respect to what the client wants.

Yes, I want this place to succeed. I live and own property in the area and am a big advocate for neighborhood bars. JPatricks started off great and slid downhill so I really want this place to better.First off, I think a big issue was the timing of when we came here. We took a seat and the manager (I think he was the manager) greeted us promptly. Another couple came in clearly after us, sat in the table next to us, and they would get better service than us, which was strange. It started with the lady complaining about how her beet was flat. The waitress turned to me because I had ordered the same beer and asked me how it was. I told her it wasn't really flat and that it was ok. The lady was given a different beer.By this point, we were ready to order, but the waitress was so concentrating on this lady that she took their order first. No big deal, but it wasn't until 5 minutes later that she took our order. We saw the chef or head cook or whatever personally deliver food to the patrons, which we thought was really neat! However, this guy all of a sudden had vested his attention to this lady who was complaining and had stayed at their table in a discussion of some sort for like 10 minutes! Who was paying attention to our food? The guy then left their table and came back with a ramekin of some sauce, explained it to them, then left to get another ramekin of sauce! So that was three visits to this table that was complaining about the beer in the first place.The manager had gone to the table of the complainer and offered them a new line of oktoberfest beer, after he delivered them one of the beers, he came to us. We ordered 2 and was told that he only had 1 left because the other table had got one! Grrr!Then our food was not delivered by the head cook guy, but by the manager. The head cook guy came and just dropped off our fries and left. No explanation, no conversation, no extra sauces, just here are your fries and gone. Only to appear less than a minute later in street clothes out for a smoke.So yes, this table of complainers really ruined our evening. But we witnessed them getting better service and more attention. My bill had the \"flat\" beer, but I bet it was removed from theirs.But like I said in the beginning, I really want this place to succeed. The owners seemed to know some of the issues (including that lady who was complaining!) and was already in the works of remedying some of the issues. I really hope so. I'm looking forward to the outdoor seating when it become warmer!Oh, one last complaint. It was a Saturday night, it was not busy, but the bathrooms were trashed.

Because there wasn't enough breading, it seemed just like greasey crisp pickle. The cheese curds were just okay. I ordered the turkey club. It came with steak fries that seemed like they were oven French fries dirty little step brother. Not that crispy or golden, no flavor and dry and mushy on the inside. The turkey was cheap and slimy on toasted white bread with a Kraft single. The tomato and iceberg lettuce shreds were fresh. Our server was very polite.

It's easy to use, lets you customize power settings to adjust the vapor levels and taste, and is really durable. \u00a0It also holds a couple different types of rechargeable batteries -- I use a large one for when I'm at work which lasts a day or two between charges, and a smaller one when I'm heading out for the night and want something a bit more discreet.Finally, there's the \"Juice\" or eLiquid:THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LAB! \u00a0They have somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 different flavors to choose from, a tasting station where you can try them all, and are great at helping you find something you'll like. \u00a0They make everything to order, so you may have to wait 5-10 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. \u00a0You can also ask them to \"customize\" the flavors a bit if you want. For people trying to find a replacement for a \"real\" cigarette, they have the only liquid I've found that actually gives you the taste of an actual cigarette -- not just a tobacco leaf flavor, but something that comes amazingly close to the burning paper and tobacco taste you'd get from the real deal. \u00a0It's called... get this: \u00a0ILLUSION.So, on to the con:They have a sign, but it's on the inside and only visible if you're looking through their front window. \u00a0On my first attempt to find them, I gave up. \u00a0On my second attempt, I passed them twice despite my GPS telling me when I'd arrived.Guys! \u00a0Get a sign on the OUTSIDE of the building. \u00a0*** Update *** - No more cons! \u00a0They have a sign!Bottom line:Great people, amazing selection of flavors, good selection of eCigs and equipment. \u00a0They're my official go-to and the best shop in the city.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 12, 18]}, "4": {"description": "OMG!

Like with any other massage place, I check out the website just to get a feel of the place. On it, they list \"special prices\" only for their first time clients and then a separate list for regular clients so be aware. It was my first time there, so the couple's massage cost $110, but I told them about the $10 Yelp offer, which reduced the price to $100 without tip. It was like a Groupon deal except an additional dollar! I called to schedule an appointment and mentioned the Yelp offer. The place is run by Asian people, so there was a language barrier, but for the most part, I was able to understand her. Be sure to mention any deals when you book an appointment otherwise they won't take it. So I'm all set for the appointment when the lady said, \"You pay cash, right? We prefer cash.\" I assumed I could pay with a credit card, but she wanted cash, so I said ok. I guess it was nice of her to tell me. That said, pay with cash.So my boyfriend and I are about to enter, but the door is locked. Confused, I pull again thinking the door is stuck and then I look inside to see a lady behind the desk who is coming towards us to open it. She let us in, but didn't offer an explanation as to why the door was locked. After we came in, she locked it behind us, which was a bit creepy. Then I thought, oh, they probably don't want to take any walk-in customers, which I could understand because it was 8 at night; I mean, I wouldn't want to work that late. Let me back track to the exterior. It may look a little iffy because the design screams Vegas, well to me at least. Also, there are huge signs taking over the windows that advertise their massage deals (for first time clients only). The interior is nice with couches to sit and a water jug to quench your thirst, but the lights were dim. It makes it a bit difficult to fill out the forms. You do have the option to go into the sauna, but we didn't due to time constraints. She'll take you down the hallway to a closet like room where you have to change your shoes to their Adidas like sandals. I hope they clean them after each use because I hate wearing other people's shoes and these didn't fit my size 5.5 feet. She motions us to follow her down the hallway, while I have difficulty keeping up because of the ill fitted sandals. Then, she takes us down the stairs to what looks like a basement, which I found a bit strange. The room was on the right and she opened the door for us and then left without saying anything. There were 2 tables and nicely folded towels on each. Usually, the masseuse tells me what I should do with the towels, but not this time. I \u00a0thought you're supposed to get under the sheet on the table, but you don't; you just lay on that and use that nicely folded towel to cover yourself. The massage itself was great. It's by far the best one I've ever had. She asks how much pressure you prefer and will periodically ask if it's the right amount. My masseuse was great and she did straddle my back (without warning) at one point to get more leverage, so be prepared. Also, my boyfriend's masseuse left during the massage without warning after she and my masseuse conversed under their breath. She came back with hot stones. My masseuse just put them on my back and then asked if it was ok. I said yes, but I would've liked her to tell me what she was going to do next. Again, be prepared. The hot stones felt amazing. At the end, they both left without warning and came back with hot washcloths. She used it to wash the oils off my body and then asked if it was ok. I said yes, and again would've liked her to tell me what she was doing. After that, they said they'll be waiting outside once we dressed. They gave us each a cup of water and then led us upstairs to pay. Overall, a great massage, but I didn't like how we weren't informed of what they were doing.

I figured I would walk over and try my luck; worst case, I'd have a good story to tell if the place turned out to be dubious.Copper Spa doesn't look like much from the outside, but there's a massage chair in the window so that made me feel better.

I asked if they had any immediate openings and they did so I booked myself in for 30 minutes. I saw Peggy, who was a nice woman in her 40s. Her English was passable, but a little hard to understand at times, but it was fine. She explained that first she would use hot towels on my feet and then do the massage and then she'd use the hot stone. She had me lie face down on the massage table, which is a bit different than other places I have been where you sit in a chair, but that's okay!So Peggy got started and the hot towels felt great and the foot massage was awesome.

It's \"smallness\" forces you to meet new people. Hanging out at the Matchbox is kind of like drinking with my brother. Like my brother, the Matchbook is dimunitive in size, lives off the blue line, and doesn't really bat an eye if you fart. Even if you've never been there, it has an \"everyone knows your name\" familiarity that larger, less tattooed, more successful bars (brothers) can match. I like dive bars, primarily because they usually lack the requesite 25 Flat Screen televisions on the Sportscenter loop. It seems to me that the less \"entertainment\" at the bar, the more human interaction. Well, the Matchbox adds the element that every time that you want to go to the bathroom, order a drink, or turn around, you're literally bumping into another patron. some might rate this as a negative, but it was kind of cool to be absolutely FORCED to meet the people surrounding you at the bar. Matchbox DOES have a small television right above the door. It was playing \"Last House on a Dead End Street,\" a 70s slasher movie. The aforementioned restroom is unisex, and at the far end of the bar from the entrance. It was pretty clean.The Box had an incredibly impressive selection of craft beer and spirits. Only 3 draught beers, but a good selection of local midwest microbrews from Bells, 3 Floyds, Left Hand, and Great Lakes. Behind the rail, the Box has 10, 12, and 15 year old Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon... pretty much the most delicious bourbon in the world. You know it's good because it's featured prominently on the TV show \"Justified\" - a drama where a Sherrif's Deputy drinks bourbon and/or moonshine, slays all of the goodlooking babes in this town, and shoots with impugnity (because it's justified).

He gave me a general quote, shook my hand, and out the door I went. This was a Wednesday evening.Fast forward to Thursday. I drop back into Spencer's gallery with my art. He was out, but I was able to leave the pieces there. I got a call from Spencer not long after, letting me know that he LOVED my art and that he was excited to set me up. I came back after work and Spencer gushed over the prints I had dropped off and gave me a final number. Now I'm no framing expert, but I've asked about custom framing before and the responses have always sent me running.

Where can you get custom framing done in less than a day and at incredibly low prices? I hadn't found it until the day I stumbled into Spencer's gallery and I may never find it again. It's worth noting, that Spencer's frame jobs are totally legitimate. The materials are great, he makes sure he's using acid free backing paper and uses Plexiglas that protects your art from UV light, and uses a heavy duty wire to hang the frame from.

The boy was running late, so I ordered a glass of wine (vinho verde, my favorite!) and looked over the menu while I waited for him. Honestly, I could have ordered everything. The whole menu sounded delicious. While it is a small menu, it's more than made up for by the quality of menu items. I decided to put in for an order of Devil's Bread so it would be coming out right around when the boy showed up.He ordered the Prairie Path when he arrived, despite not being gluten free, and said it was great. The Devil's Bread came out and was akin to a very fancy french bread pizza, with spicy salami. Delicious! It sounds simple, but sometimes simple can be simply great! We decided to order the hot sopressata (sp?) and the mole charcuterie, along with the delice de bourgogne and cheddar cheese. The plate came with nuts, honey, and dried fruit, and a generous amount of bread. All SO tasty! The mole was incredibly unexpected, as it was very sweet, but went very well with the creamy cheese. I ordered another glass, this time the rose cava. While it was tasty, it was a bit too sweet for my liking. He ordered a glass of the Red Wrangled (I think that's what it was called), a mix of a few different reds. I wish I had ordered that too! So good! For dessert, we split the brownie flight, which I can only describe as orgasmic. Good lord. So good.

The star that they automatically get is for the cleanliness of the store. beyond that this \u00a0is the worst T-mobile retailer I have ever been to. I came in to upgrade my phone. I got a Nexxus 4 and my husband got an iPhone 5. They have a sign outside that says upgrade your smart phone for $99. So I thought nice, $200 for both right? Wrong! The guy then tells me it's really $150 per phone because you have to pay taxes on the entire original price of the phone ($700). Whatever, I pay the additional $100. \u00a0After a few days my husband decided that he liked my phone better and we decided to take it back and exchange it for something better. First of all, there is a $50 restocking fee that isn't credited to the price of the new phone. okay whatever we pay the fee and want to move forward with getting the new phone. They then say they refunded the excess I already paid onto my credit card and that it would be refunded in three days... Why couldn't they just apply the rest to the new phone? Well, I was planning on using that towards the phone so I decided to wait the three days when the funds come back. Well they never did. I went back to the store to tell them that they never sent the money and that they needed to credit the money back to me, the man tells me \"we don't refund something we already refunded\". Well that's great and all, but you didn't refund it. I then call T-mobile customer service to see if they can do something, but they inform me that only the store can refund the money. So they call the store and get the same response, except the T-mobile customer service rep said that wasn't acceptable if the money never posted to my bank account. We were then told that the \"manager\" would have to handle it, but he was out until Monday and that he would call me then. Monday comes still no money in my account and no phone call from the manager. Tuesday I go back to the store with my bank statement. The manager tells me that sometimes the credit card companies hold refunds for 30 days and to come back then. Thirty days later I come back still no refund. And he refuses to give it back.

T-mobile has a policy of inconveniencing their customers, so I had to order them over the phone) each one of which has been \"refurbished\" which is tmobile speak for \"broken.\" The young woman who helped me looked up my account and said I could get a free upgrade, which of course I could not just do in the store, but this is not her or the stores fault, it is the policy of t mobile- inconvenience, you know. So she set that up and I thought I would have to wait til tuesday to use my phone again, but after setting up the free upgrade, she messed with my phone and somehow got it working again. yay! I just want to say this is the ONLY positive experience I have had in a T-Mobile store in the past two years, or since the AT&T merger fell through and t-mobiles service has gone straight to hell.
