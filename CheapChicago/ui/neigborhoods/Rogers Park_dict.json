Sometimes the meat is really fresh but I've come across kinda smelly stuff. Mostly the fish is what I worry about. The beef has always been tasty and the chicken breasts in the case are HUGE and super cheap, if you see stuffed chicken breasts in your near future grab them here. I've also decided the taco meat deserves regular ingestion or indigestion depending on how spicy the serranos I add to the tacos/burritos are. One other must have thing from here is the cheese. They get their selection from a place in Wisconsin and it's always priced much lower than the taste suggests. Also if you go all the way to the back of the store you will find a huge stock of spices and dried peppers. Compare the prices to chain groceries and you will never spend $5 on 3 cinnamon sticks again.So summing up. Why shop elsewhere when you can get quality food for less and support local business?

We ordered the following: Pancakes (2) took up the whole plate, well done and a little thinned out made them a little crispy around the edges (this is a good thing), bacon well done, not greasy (best bacon ever), hash browns instead of eggs (no up charge), juice $8.50 (this was ordered for dinner) Challah French Toast thick but not texas toast thick great flavor and browned just right but not hard at all, 2 eggs scrambled cooked to perfection not brown not runny - perfect, bacon well done and so good, soda $8.50 Huge container of syrup to share, lots of cream and sugar on the table (my biggest pet peeve is to keep tracking down the server for condiments)Service she was fast, friendly all while they were about to close.

Service is friendly and fast (if not overly attentive) with no niceities like \"I'll be taking care of you today and litany of specials. The host greets some folks with loud good mornings and some folks by name and she points out table options and asks what you want.Coffee isn't the quality you'd get from an upscale brunch place, but not as thin or stale as you'd get a lot of other greasy spoons, and they won't let you hit the bottom of your mug.$10 minimum on credit cards is my only complaint, and high minimums (as much as I know credit card fees probably suck for local businesses) force a loss of a star in my book.

Got on the train went home and got the food out to eat it. They gave me the wrong order of 1 small dinner. Instead of chicken it was Oxtail. So I tryed to call Redz 5 times with no anwser. It was the middle of the day and they were not busy. So I decided since they wouldnt anwser their phone Im taking it back and getting what I ordered. \u00a0The manager was walking out the door when we walked up. I explained to him that he gave us the wrong order...This was his response...Im sorry but you can just keep it..this was at the door..didnt even let us come in first...So again I explained how I want my order corrected and he said no Im not doing that. I said fine then since you dont know how to treat a paying customer I want my money back. Again he said no! So I said...You will give me my money back. You messed up the order. You need to fix this now. So instead of putting my money back to the card we used he opened the register and threw 10.00 at me and said take it. I put the food on the counter and left.

I decided to try El Pueblito first since it is closest to us... I may not need to look any further.First, let me say that I judge all Mexican food by the \"La Juanita's Standard\". La Juanita's was the sole authentic Mexican restaurant in my hometown in IA. There may or may not have been illegal drug trade going on in the basement, but I can always put my morals aside for some shrimp cocktail with avocado! Everything on their handwritten menu board was perfect and I have been hard pressed to anything that lives up to the \"La Jua's Standard\" since... until now.Let's start with the chips. I hate hard, thick and burnt tasting tortilla chips... which I sometimes feel is the industry standard at these type of places. However, El Pueblito's chips were a) fresh out of the fryer and still piping hot, b) thin and delicate, and c) perfectly salted; everything that one could ask for in a tortilla chip. Next, the guacamole, which! I am pretty picky about because I can make a mean guac myself, however!, this guac sent me to the 10th level of heaven. It was perfectly, salted, limed, spiced and went amazingly well with the chips. Tacos: I had al pastor, barbacoa, beef and chorizo, all amazing, though the barbacoa is what I would revisit first. Each taco filling was grilled with onion and topped with cilantro. Everything was made fresh and the tacos weren't too soggy or greasy, which is a common problem at some taquerias. El, Pueblito, you are batting 1000.I also tried a few bites of Sope, which included fresh lettuce, tomato, sour cream and cheese and I was not let down; just as tasty as the tacos.Additionally, the salsas were wonderful (we were given more than enough red and green salsa with our order) and a side order of rice and beans is more than enough for two to three people (and also yummy).The decor inside the restaurant is decent, your typical storefront Mexican fare, but they do feature some amazingly tacky but wonderful artwork. My favorite features an Aztec warrior (Montezuma?) carrying a nude (unconscious?) female to the top of a mountainside.

Please, let me tell you a story.My housemate and I had just moved into town turn of the millennium, and we were still partying something awful. We had a directory of places to hit between the Gold Coast and Rogers Park even before getting here, and we'd have probably missed this place, only a few blocks away from home, were it not for the neon beer signs in the window and the line to the carry-out booth at the front of the bar.In contrast to the fancy bars and clubs we'd been hitting up, this place was a dive, and a lively one. Sports played on the small screen TVs over the rectangle bar island in the middle of a smoky room, with three or four hardcore bartenders, in particular Gigi, who could project her voice across the noisiest crowd. If you acted like a halfway decent human being, she'd treat you with class; if you were a jerk, she let you know. Even crowded, if you sat at the bar and your glass or bottle was almost empty, one of the tenders, especially Gigi, checked if you were ready for another one.Drunks pelted darts at the boards, pinball machines pinged in the corner, the pool table held its own court, and after dark the place was standing-room stumbling until 4AM (5AM on Saturdays). Though clearly Bears and Cubs biased, this was a hockey bar in the Bill Wirtz era; there were as many Red Wings fans here as Blackhawks fans, and a Wings game could be caught consistently. They sold cheap beer buckets, inexpensive highballs and shots, basic smokes and fancy flavored tins of Camels; some of the regulars created clouds with cigars.That first night, my buddy and I had been at it the whole evening and were louder and wobblier than we probably should have been; before the evening was up, we found a large bouncer with thick glasses and a goatee standing behind us, and he let us know it was time for us to go. \"What?\" I slurred back. \"You guys have had enough,\" he said, non-judgementally but with finality. \"You're welcome back tomorrow night, but you gotta go tonight.\" His cool delivery inspired us to cooperate without hard feelings, and we did go back. Many times, for many years. I took friends, co-workers up to this place. It lived up to its late-night dive legend and everyone loved it as much as I did.Flash forward, right past 9/11, right past a recession, and the Illinois smoking ban.My housemate and myself pretty much got it all out of our system. We almost never go to bars anymore; no time, no inclination. On the rare occasion when we had the next day off and felt like getting out for the house, the last watering hole standing in our book was Oasis. Our most recent visit, the pool table was unmanned, one of the well-worn dartboards was subject to some aiming under the influence, and only about eight seats at the bar were populated. The smoky haze is gone, giving the place a cleaner feel, enhanced by replacement of the old TV tubes with brightly colored flat screens, still playing ESPN. Gigi's still there, manning the bar solo that night; she greeted us as we pushed through the swing doors and had our chilled glasses and tall boys on the bar before we settled into our stools (drinks are still cheap here; the tall cans are a deal).Joint thinly crowded, the jukebox, replaced by a digital player, still pumped out the same analog electric classic rock (which, by now, are probably golden oldies). We were still welcome to puff on our e-cigarettes (vapor, no smoke) while enjoying cold suds. Gigi held court, holding conversation from the center of the bar, and before long everyone sitting there were all talking across the place about everything from the Mayors Daley (Jr. and Sr.) to development around the Loyola campus (she literally introduced everyone at the bar to each other by name). I think she caught me eyeing the cylinder of pretzels by the register; before I even said anything, she scooped up a handful of sticks and served them in a cup between our glasses (alas, the bar pizzas are no more, but the pretzels are free).Then around two o'clock, things picked up with the younger crowd filing in, looking to continue their buzzes from the closing bars about the neighborhood (particularly Hamilton's down the street). Somehow, though the Loyola University kids have the normal personality disorders to get out of their youthful systems, they're not as obnoxious as your typical college crowd. I enjoyed watching the activity build, the dartboards feeling some love, the pool table finally being played, but finally it was time to go.\"Good night, gentlemen,\" Gigi's voice projected over the noisy rejuvenation of the bar. \"Don't wait so long before coming back!\"I would rate a good dive bar a three, with a smile. Oasis is special enough to rate four stars, just by virtue of the longevity of its unique personality. That fifth star is for Gigi.

Now, for those of you who don't know (which is... all of you), I grew up in a small town in Missouri. Everything closed at 9 p.m.--Except for you, Wal-Mart--and entertainment was slim for those of us who were old enough to drink, but young enough to manage multiple days of hangovers in a row. All we had were old fashioned townie bars and dives that dotted the spurs and side streets of our back-country roads. This bar is like a transplant of one of those nostalgia-triggering watering holes of my youth. I found this bar on accident late one Sunday night when I was out with me chums shredding some sweet riffs at a karaoke bar. Their night ended early (11:30, what??) and we scoured the internet looking for another place that did karaoke on a Sunday night. Oasis was the only one in RP that pulled a karaoke all-nighter, so off we went. Ladies and Gents, this place is divey as hell. Old school wrap-around bar setup, separate pool/dart area, classic arcade games, juke box, sports blaring from reitna-searing flatscreens above the bar, and absolutely zero pretension. My friends were put off by how townie and, yes, slightly grungy this place was, but my darling readers: THAT'S THE CHARM. This place is just a blue-collar-working-stiff-Norm-and-Jack-shootin-the-shit kind of bar. Not every place can--or should--be a Luxbar or a Sidetracks or any number of the other Gold Coast or Boystown shiny toy bars. The bartenders are attentive and kind, the drinks are affordable, even the karaoke isn't as invasive and watch-me-and-shut-up as most other places are. I applaud this joint. Is it slightly creepy? Sure. Has there most likely been a stabbing here at some point? Why not. Is there a really good chance that someone has shot up in the bathroom? Absolutely. But it's Rogers Park.

I checked Pure out due to their low prices for a brow wax. I was used to paying $18 a month and I was happy with the services BUT if I could get it done for cheaper, why the heck not? So, I did. I had my brows waxed and threaded. When I went in I was expecting only the wax. I compare eyebrow threading to childbirth even though I am a child free woman. I'd rather take a few hours of menstrual cramps on a scale of 7-8 or a day or two of fibro pain than have my eyebrows threaded. I stuck in there though and I was satisfied with the results. I scheduled an appointment for a mani/pedi special ($32 for month of August/Tuesday-Thursday, I was informed it's normally $35 which isn't bad either) for two weeks later-8/21. I arrived a bit early and I was encouraged to pick out a color. I brought a bottle from home for my toes and they had no problem using it. I am highly satisfied with the results of the mani/pedi. I loved getting a hot neck pillow-it smelled of cinnamon-as I got my manicure. I loved the quick massage I received while waiting for my nails to dry. During my two experiences here it seems like Pure is building up a small but loyal group of regulars. I will now count myself as one of them. My budget doesn't exactly allow for a mani/pedi every month BUT I will come here for my pedicure services.

I have a couple of areas where I'm \"light on hair\" and he has helped me contend with that.

You use those scissors that only cut out some pieces?

I've heard so many horror stories about women who've gotten horrible infections from dirty foot spas, and I've never seen a nail technician do a thorough cleaning of a spa before I use it. Instead, this salon uses resin basins which are cleaned after every use. It made me feel safe, and just the foot soak was very relaxing.The manager was incredibly knowledgeable about all the products they carry and made good recommendations for me. The hand and foot massages weren't very long, but I enjoyed what I did get. Also, even though the nail tech, Claudia, was gentle and took good care of my cuticles and nails, the polish on my fingers is starting to peel on the edges already. I don't normally get finger polish, so I'm not sure why this is happening. Claudia did give me tips for keeping up my cuticles and nails at home though without having to buy special products, so that was really nice.I decided while I was there to get my eyebrows threaded too, and they accommodated me no problem. Claudia also did the threading and gave me the best looking eyebrows I've ever had.

Of course their greens are awesome and their lentils are fantastic. My only word of caution is tothe coffee.

If you like Ethiopian food, you owe it to yourself to go here! It's the best I've ever had and beats the places on Broadway (not so much a knock on them as a compliment to this place!). I know, I know, this is Eritrean food technically, not Ethiopian. But the culinary traditions are very similar (they were one country at one time) - and to my mind the food had much the same flavor but was so much better prepared.For three of us, we ordered tibsi lamb, tibsi chicken and a fish dish (can't remember the exact name of that one). Everything was prepared to perfection! What I loved most about this place, unlike many of the ethnic food restaurants I've tried in the city, including very much the Ethiopian, is that they didn't substitute oil/fat in place of flavor. Sure, everything was cooked in oil, but there wasn't puddles of it saturating the Injera (bread) like I remember from the other places. The dishes themselves were a bit spicy, but it wasn't overpowering - again, not overdoing it here and relying more on the underlying, and awesome! flavors of the dishes themselves. Well prepared food should not be about masking/overpowering flavors, but about bringing out the true subtleties of the dish. On spiciness, my wife, who can't handle heat at all, was able to get through the meal and was very satisfied!So overall, amazing food! Price wise, it felt slightly above the other places, but given how large the portions were and the superior quality of the food, I would say very reasonable - $13 - $15 per entree which includes a number of tasty sides. On the portions, the three dishes were enough for two meals each for the three of us, but the food was so incredibly tasty, we devoured it all - yes, including every last bit of Injera on the tray!If you like Ethiopian food, or maybe had a bad experience before, and want to try something that's done how it should be, go here!", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 8, 31]}, "8": {"description": "First time coming here and the food was absolutely delicious we got the number 4 the alisha siga with medium spice.

After I finished eating I spent a few minutes chatting with the gentleman serving me and asked him about the country this type of food comes from. \u00a0He seemed happy to answer my questions and was forgiving of my slaughtering of the pronunciation of the country's name and shared with me a bit of the history of how and when the country won it's independence. \u00a0It's always a nice bonus when I can not only eat some great food, but also learn a little about the part of the world where the flavors were generated.The interior of the restaurant while nothing fancy was nothing that would discourage a person from eating there. \u00a0It was very clean and I felt very at ease eating there. \u00a0The prices at first glance appeared just a little higher than what I'm used to paying at other restaurants that serve similar type cuisines. \u00a0The good news though is after tasting the flavors I can assure you that it was worth every penny and then some. \u00a0Personally I'd gladly pay considerably more if necessary to enjoy the flavors I had today.Overall a very enjoyable meal and I'm looking forward to many more at Den Den. \u00a0If you like Ethiopian food you'll really appreciate the food here since it is very similar.", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 7, 2]}, "40": {"description": "I went on January 15, 2014 for lunch with a friend.

As noted elsewhere , the budget section is \u00a0pretty interesting , but Funk Trunk also carries a good selection of new vinyl reissues and hard to find LPs from the 50's to the present. The fact that there is a Funk Trunk in Rogers Park is cause to celebrate . Record stores in Rogers Park pretty much died the death around the time Kurt Cobain did. Funk Trunk brings back some of the vibe of the late , great Round Records , in that the atmosphere is relaxed , and you can almost always find yourself getting into an intelligent conversation about music , while having some laughs in the process.

They do use hot towels as well, which was nice. My pedicure was completed at 7:55 pm, but I was not rushed out. She let me stay longer so I wouldn't damage my toes. SHE'S SO NICE!! It hurts.It is so hard to find a legit nail salon. I have gone to so many nail salons that spend more time on lotioning your legs and feet then actually cleaning your nails and heels. No nail salon has gotten higher than 2 stars from me.Also, it is nice to see the technicians have their nails done! I understand that being in this work your nails can get messy or chipped, but you need to show clients/customers how well you do your own nails. All the technicians had their nails done. It might not seem like a big deal to most ppl, but that really stood out to me (in a good way).Overall Impression: The place is really small. Its half the size of normal salons, but I actually liked that. They are on the bottom level of a condo complex. It took me a minute to try to figure out how to get in. I just called them and she buzzed me in. I am not sure if they are listed on the buzzer. So don't panic if you can't find the front door lolParking: There is street parking. It can be hard to find since it is so close to Loyola. Payments: They do accept CC's but Cash is preferred. You can tip via CC, but the charge it towards the full amount instead of separating it.Prices: They have standard nail salon prices. $15 for mani, $25 for pedi, $25 gel nailsGood to Know: Thursdays is mani+pedi for $30", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 5, 23]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Rogers Park"], "latitude": 42.0041527, "longitude": -87.6610222, "rating": "4.5", "times": {"Mon": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Thu": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sat": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Wed": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Tue": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sun": ["11:00 am", "6:00 pm"], "Fri": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Nail Salons", "othersalons"]], "address": ["6720 N Sheridan Rd"], "attributes": {"Parking": "Street", "By Appointment Only": "No", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes"}, "category": "Beauty", "number_of_reviews": "44"}, "bopngrill-chicago-3": {"comments": {"58": {"description": "Excellent umami burger!

At first, I thought I knew what to expect when going to a gay bar, having lived in Lakeview on the cusp of Boystown, but after arriving at The Glenwood, my thoughts were turned absolutely around.First off, the staff are all really nice and approachable, from the nice doorman to the attentive bartenders. The drink specials are usually really good, the menu is fairly extensive for the area of the city it is in, and you can never go wrong with $6 double-pints. A well-worn billiards table is in the back of the main room, which is surprisingly spacious, as is two dart machines. Usually, the bar will provide patrons with pizza as well, which is a mighty fine gesture if you ask me. The TVs are usually playing the big sports games or Cartoon Network's [Adult Swim], which always goes over well with my group of friends, and the music selection is pretty good. Once, we were there when the bar had a DJ, and he played a great selection of Top 40 and classic dance, and it was a pretty good unexpected night of dancing.Everyone who frequents the bar all seem to either know each other or, at the very least, those on staff, which lends an air of community to the bar, which is always nice to see. The bar also lends alot of support to the community itself, which you can't argue with.The two one-person bathrooms are a little iffy at times on cleanliness, and the locks don't always work. There have been times when I will catch a glance of someone unknowingly (I cant only hope) walk in on someone already in a bathroom.

Andy had two hard-working kids then and they eventually bought it from him when he started another business on Sheridan and Pratt in Rogers Park- but most importantly, he left his Broaster.There really isn't another place in Rogers Park that offers Broasted Chicken- \u00a0except for this little corner restaurant. For so many years, it was worth the 8-minute wait to get a 4-piece chicken dinner with four quarters of broasted potatoes, a cup of cole-slaw and bread and butter. It was crispy on the outside and so moist and tender on the inside. So often when I walked in the door, I could never decide on the Chicken Dinner or the Gyros, so I usually got both. \u00a0 When Andy left, those two hard workers bought the place and continued the tradition. Though the Kronos Gyros could be had anywhere (and still can), nowhere could you get Broasted Chicken this good, or for such a good price (for years up until the mid-2000;s, it was less than $6.) Finally, Nino bought the others' half and ran it with his line cook, sometimes his wife, and himself, every day save Sunday. Even when the neighborhood soured and went south, the crime rate in the area grew, he stayed with it and finally, Rogers Park came back. Through it all, the chicken remained fantastic. I moved to Streamwood in 1991 and Carpentersville in 1999; I STILL drove into the city 8-10 times a year JUST to get a Broasted Chicken dinner, sometimes as many as 4, put in a Styrofoam container, wrap in a blanket and drive back and still eat a hot, juicy meal. My kids loved it. My wife loved it. Neighbors came to love it. I would park my car nearby, eat a chicken dinner, and take the Red Line to Wrigley Field for a Cub's game. Except for almost always losing the game, it was always a great time.I write this elongated description so you'll understand HOW and WHY I am so disappointed in what has happened to this Rogers Park icon. Nino has retired and sold the \"joint\"; the new owner: while innovative with some of the new menu choices, use of social media and other option like Grub Hub, physical menus and delivery service, he has destroyed this once proud, beautiful, moist, tender and delicious staple. The chickens he uses are smaller, never fresh, and perhaps for that reason, are overcooked to eradicate any bacteria or to get rid of that \"old\" taste. (Good chicken should never have an odor).All this means that when we now pay for the $7+ dinner, each piece is hard, the interior is DRY and CHEWEY and some pieces, inedible. In the past 4 years, I've returned dozens of times, hoping to once again find it done right. And I have been disappointed each and every time. The same recipe is used that made it taste so good, but it's like putting lipstick on a pig- or rather a chicken beak. The Gyros is good, but it's the pre-made and frozen Kronos, so as long as it's not overcooked, it's a no-brainer and cookie-cutter food.There isn't a good Broasted Chicken place around Rogers Park- nor is there a good restaurant that sells a good chicken dinner. The least-bad alternative is KFC up on Western & Pratt, but the employees and service are so, so bad and poor there, and the chicken so grease-soaked and un-cared for, I don't recommend going there- ever.If the new owner wants to return this meal back to its previous delicious and high standard, he needs to stop thinking that buying old, cheap, small chicken parts will help him increase his profits; if you sell less of a bad thing, it won't make it profitable. Put the effort back into your place and reap the rewards; you've already lost myself and countless others as customers. Remember you have Mayne Stage just across the street, the Art community on the other side of the EL, and many festivals in the area that would give you a chance to make a positive impact and a memorable meal rather than the stuff you're serving now.Was it, or IS it worth it? And for Gods' sake, Man- you still have that stalwart, perfectly seasoned original Broaster- please sell it to someone that will use it properly instead of letting it produce inferior chunks of dried white wood-like chicken.

At first, my roommate and I were really excited to find our dream couch for so cheap. Grant seemed really nice and helpful and said they would deliver it the next day. The next day came and we agreed on a time of 6-7ish pm. They called and asked if we could be at home at 5:30, they called at 5 -_-. We had to reschedule since we couldn't be home for the early unexpected delivery. We waited till Saturday and finally when Saturday came we got a call from of course Grant. He was really nice but explained that \"Ashley had delivered the wrong color, is that okay?\" So it wasn't okay, clearly. We were trying to work something out and my roommate and I just didn't want to wait any longer so we just agreed to get the right couch on the same day but the only thing was the chaise was going to be on the opposite side from what we had originally ordered. Once the couch came, we realized the chaise on the left side actually didn't work. Since Grant was so nice, we called back asking if it was possible to swap pieces, he said \"yes sure no problem.\" Both me and my roommate were relieved. Next week came, Grant was off for majority of the week, we couldn't get in touch with anyone except this A-hole Paul. He started screaming at me saying it wasn't their fault and it was our fault for accepting the couch the way it was. The thing that rang a bell in our minds was what happened to that correct couch that was suppose to be delivered that one Monday. Grant called back eventually denying everything completely changing his attitude and becoming rude. He said that we were putting words in his mouth, never agreed to swapping pieces and we shouldn't have taken it the wrong way. He also said he didn't appreciate being lied to about us not having any furniture when the delivery guys came and saw our old couch. Talk about hypocrisy, okay so we had a temporary couch and wanted the new one asap, but hello he was lying to us about the couch that just magically disappeared that was suppose to be delivered that monday. Granted we should have just waited, but the unprofessionalism, the yelling, the hanging up on us, the no returning calls-completely shitty service. i don't recommend them at all-yes they re cheap but remember you get what you pay for!

It's also unfortunate to provide a low star rating that is the result of one person, when the other staff members - Danny, Mark, and Grant were all really good. Based on my first experience with the store-I would have given them five stars...after the ordeal with Ron today, I can only give two stars! I'll provide an update after my furniture is delivered though.So....I first went to this furniture store a few weeks ago based on the recommendation of a trusted colleague. The sales persons were all very personable and helpful, without being overly aggressive. While they didn't have the items I wanted, they were more than happy to order them. I was purchasing a dining room table, six chairs, console table, two end tables, and a coffee table. The total was over $1600. I expressed my concern about the chairs being vinyl (since who wants to spend $1600+ on furniture and it look cheap!) but one of the associates indicated that the chairs didn't come in a fabric option and if I didn't like the vinyl chairs upon arrival - it was easy to select another option. Sounded like a good deal, especially since they included free delivery and assembly. Great. Fast forward...while searching online, I found the dining room chairs in a fabric option from the same company. They look almost exactly like the vinyl chairs, but are fabric. I sent an email to Marjens with the link and indicated that I wanted those chairs instead. Received a response today saying it wasn't possible to obtain the fabric chairs because this was a special order. I responded indicating that I was coming into the store to discuss in-person.When I arrived, initially I started with Mark, who stated that this was a special order and it wasn't possible to change chairs. I responded saying this wasn't the message I received a few weeks ago. We talk for a few minutes and the the real problem starts when Ron decides to enter the discussion. He reiterates Mark's points, then begins raising his voice because of his frustration that I am not simply accepting that I can't switch the chairs. Suddenly, we are both yelling and he says \"just because you have a Ph.D. doesn't mean you're smarter than me!\" Wait - how does my degree have anything to do with exchanging some chairs?!?! The only reason he even knows I have a doctorate is because I use my work email which includes my professional signature. I hadn't mentioned anything related to his intellect or insulted him in any way, but I guess he was offended because I had the nerve to not simply accept purchasing vinyl chairs that I was told could be easily exchanged! I mentioned that I reviewed the Yelp comments (unfortunately after I'd made my purchase) and see why many of the reviews are so bad. I stated that wasn't my initial experience, but given this exchange I too would be writing a review. Ron yelled that he would be writing a rebuttal...as if I should feel concerned!Ultimately, I had to inform Ron that I would NOT engage in any additional dialogue with him. He continued ranting and I stopped responding. Fortunately, Danny finally jumped in and said it would be easy to order the fabric chairs and not a problem at all. Of course, Ron is still trying to jump in the conversation talking about the special order business, but Danny assures me that it's possible and fine. Mark proceeds to find the fabric chairs among their books and I pay $60+ more since these chairs are supposedly $10 more each (although when I made it home, I looked them up again and they are only $5 more). In summary, the pros are that you really can find good deals and most of the sales people are very nice and helpful. Danny is fantastic.

I went in and when the guys asked if I needed help, I said I was just looking for now and they didn't seem to have any problem with that.

I asked how soon I could get it - having been told at least 10 days everywhere else - and he said \"How about tomorrow?\".

First of all, the website claims to have free range meat purchased from local farmers. Their meat selection consisted of some prepackaged chicken, burger patties, and brats in a small freezer. The produce selection was not impressive but I guess you can't expect a surplus of organic fruits and veggies in February. Vegetables that weren't leafy greens were pre-wrapped in plastic. I did not like being able to inspect the food first but figured it was a business tactic to avoid product waste. After two days in my fridge, I unwrapped the broccoli and it was moldy. The zucchini didn't make it 72 hours. If I lived within walking distance, I would probably stop by to pick up produce for a meal that same day.

The difference with New Leaf compared to the likes of Whole Foods is that when I shop there I know my money is going to support local businesses and keep natural and organic food accessible in Rogers Park. It's not just the owners and workers of the store we're supporting. New Leaf carries a variety of locally roasted coffee, locally grown eggs and produce in addition to yummy prepared food. My favorite is getting the BBQ Seitan and other goodies from Soul Vegetarian which would otherwise require a long trek to the south side.My wife and I have come to love their weekly produce box. Because there's just two of us we get the $15 box which is a good value containing a nice variety of in-season fruits and vegetables. You can also choose an all-veggie or all-fruit box instead, and change your order week to week. During the winter months the box tends to be heavy on the greens and root vegetables, because that's what's in season. What's great about that is it's given us a strong incentive to learn new ways to prepare these healthy staples. New Leaf helps us along in this endeavor because they send interesting recipes for their produce box contents each week to their email subscribers.I must admit that I wish there were a food co-op somewhere on the north side, and more co-ops in general in Chicago.

The focus is organic foods, and they have things I've never seen at Whole Foods, Wild Oats, or even Willy Street in Madison. The owner or owners like to bring in locally grown products in the produce, dairy, and meat sections. Whenever I ask for a product they're out of or that I just want, the staff has always encouraged me to make a request. I've never taken them up on the offer, but I think deliveries come in on Tuesdays and Fridays. They have a menu with tasty sandwiches and coffee too. Carrot cake by the register always looks tempting. Most recently I have fallen in love with some sort of raw food product in little packets that's by the door: \"It's Alive Organic Cultured Foods\" Raw Sprouted Sauerkraut Crackers. A friend looked at the label, raised an eyebrow, told me they smelled like cat food, tried a piece, and then wouldn't give them back. She said they were quite possibly the coolest food ever. That was the Sea Vegetable flavor, but they also have Dill Garlic and something called Thai Chi that is a ginger flavored one. They're pretty pricey at $4.95 for a 3 oz. packet of four, but I can't eat potato chips and these are way more healthful, so I'm happy to get them as a treat once in a while.Recently I've noticed that several of the products in here are actually cheaper than Whole Foods, Wild Oats, or Willy Street. An organic tea brand (Choice?), for example, was $3.29, and many of the veggies and fruits are comparably priced. Marantha nut butters too. Brands include Organic Valley (cheeses), Seven Stars (yogurt), Equal Exchange (coffee), Divine chocolate, Spectrum (oils and vinegar)...exactly the same sorts of products you'd have to travel to Evanston or Lakeview to get. Why not walk here instead? (Street parking is available at times, but it's not easy. The Loyola el stop and buses that run along Devon and Sheridan are within two blocks of the place.) You'll burn a few calories instead of fossil fuel.

There are also a few pasta choices I have yet to try because I can't stop eating the Amazing Kale Burger and The Veggie-Ca Do. \u00a0 Mhhhmmm...Up next, The Sunday Brunch. \u00a0I would have never thought that a pub would even know what Quinoa or Kimchi is, let alone serve it on a Sunday for brunch, in a bowl...

This isn't to say it's a terrible place, just that there's really nothing that sets it apart from any other 'bar/grill'. As far as atmosphere goes, the exposed ceilings and concrete floors make it feel like I'm sitting in a Costco food court, not some place I'd want to spend any length of time at. Service was average for Rogers Park. I waited 5 mins at the bar (on a not so busy night) before a bartender came over for my order. Probably average given how not-so-busy the place was.So, all of this 'meh' is why I'm giving it a 3 star rating.

I would have liked the option for a side of fruit instead of toast -- and perhaps that would have been possible, though I didn't see it on the menu and didn't ask.My husband also had the spiked lemonade, which was on special for $5 during brunch, along with mimosas and bloody marys.

Great texture and flavor. Next they brought out the chicken gumbo. The chicken gumbo didn't have a normal gumbo flavor, but a new gumbo chili fused taste. It was served over rice. After that they brought out the corn bread, collar greens, and red beans and rice. The red beans and rice were good not great but very good. The collar greens were also very good. The corn bread was flavorful, but not the best I have ever had. The dinner plates were ordered were: the chicken, the chunky thighs poboy, the shrimp poboy, and the blackened catfish. WOW, the fried chicken was incredible, my daughter who usually doesn't have much fried food had two pieces of the chicken. It was excellent in flavor and great crunch. Not fatty at all. The chunky thighs poboy was great in flavor not to spicy, good portion and very tasty. I really liked the shrimp poboy. The breading on the shrimp was excellent, great sauce and all in all my favorite dish. The catfish was food and flavorful, but be mindful it was spicy for my mother. The deserts were top notch as well: I had the bread pudding and everyone else had the peach cobbler. Just incredible, good sweet soul food deserts.

My crunch roll at first glance disappointed me. There was ample crab and tempura, but where were the veggies--the carrots, cucumber, and avocado? Nowhere to be found. Nevertheless, I tried a roll and was blown away! It was phenomenal--the sweet crab meat, fresh rice, salty and crunchy tempura all blended together to form the perfect yin and yang of sushi. The rolls were also the perfect eating size for one-biters. My spring rolls looked fantastic, but were overpoweringly sweet. The outside had a nice light and crispy texture, and there was really nothing wrong with them other than they lacked...something. I tried to remedy them with wasabi and soy sauce, which helped a bit.

Not much street parking so walk if you can.It is very clean so that's good or this would be one star.The waitress probably thought she was just being friendly and helpful but my goodness shut up long enough for a person to think. For a lunch she was do a hard sell on $16-$19 dinners, really pushing the margaritas even after being told my girlfriend cannot drink and it's too early for me. We had to ask 3 times for just a few minutes to read the menu!Had the cheese enchilada's in mole. Some people will like the reddish mole, its just not the style I like. The rice was passable as was the beans but nothing to write home about at almost $10. She had 3 steak tacos, small, very small, lots of rice and beans. It was ok, at I think around $8.50. Most of the menu are high priced dinners, a little section at the back for halfway reasonable tacos and such.You'd think a place that pushes $20 meals would at least have glasses for your can of coke. Oh and I needed a knife so I got metal utensils, my gf got a tiny plastic fork.I'm used to places like this having the TV compete with the music but both were so blaringly loud it almost drove us out, especially when the drunk patron in back (only 2 other people besides us) started singing terribly and the 5 people \"working\" there were amused.There were a couple things on the menu I might like to try for dinner but I'll go someplace with a little more class at those prices, have a feeling way too many margaritas are consumed in the evening to be a pleasant place to hang out over a nice dinner.

Had ordered thru GrubHub (wonder if they ever read Yelp reviews..), traffic was not toooo bad; Peter K's 'free parking' must be in the rear, somewhere. No hanging sign, if you blink you'll miss it.Here's the blow-by-blow:Nachos. Or I should properly say \"nachos\". $7!!! for six or seven tiny pieces of whatever kind of bread base they use, a teensy bit of melted cheese... \u00a0OK, so, like WHERE'S THE BEEF? And everything else that I've grown to know and love about nachos? \u00a0These are a must-miss.Enchilada dinner (carne asada, mole sauce). \u00a0Urp.Corn tortillas: tough.Carne: beefsteak of some kind, non-marinated. Chewy, tough, couple inedible pieces.Mole: now.. I was raised on the South East Side, a melting-pot of cultures. Matter of fact, all my best grammar & highschool buds weren't wedos (white people), their moms could COOK.Cuetzala's mole was.. well, it tasted burnt, tangy, spicy. \u00a0That's not what Rosendo's mom's mole was like at all, that was sweet and little tangy, just. \u00a0Great arroz con pollo y mole. Man.Quite anemic looking 'spanish? rice' and frijoles; not much of a taste treat there.Some kind of attempt at a salad or veggie toppings and a chunk of aguacate (avocado).That was the best part...(Chicken) Taco Dinner..Fair tacos but they put sauce on that I dint ask for. The rest was a carbon-copy of the enchilada dinner.One carne asada (steak) taco on the side. Same quality as the enchilada.Guacamole: not bad, but too spicy for my partner. Chips? Thin, light, crunchy.Flan (doubt if it's homemade): dint get to try it, my partner Really likes Flan...All this.. for ONLY $37. Wow.Hmm. Revising my rating to One star only, down from two.Go with the guac, but be aware that Jewel has a decent guac as well.Net: -way- overpriced, so-so Mexican food. \u00a0There's another place further up ClarkI've been to, hope they're still they're.

The broth also has readily available proteins to manufacture antibodies, after a blissful nap you will awaken feeling so much better. Of course I was so happy to discover Qaato a few blocks from my house. They make the soup to order from scratch so call ahead as it takes at least 45 minutes. \u00a0That means you can customize your soup which they did for me. I did ask for very spicy. She seemed amused, I thought I would need to sign a waiver to get the soup but a verbal agreement was all she required that I eat this at my own risk. She doesn't know me. I do miss my old friend on Morse, who made the soup that had me collapsed and hallucinating. This soup wasn't as spicy, but it's understandable, it's not something you want to be handing out to strangers, could be used as a murder weapon. \u00a0They also Americanize it a bit, with tons of meat. Next time I will order extra broth, since meat is not appetizing with a cold. I can tell she does what she promises in the menu and selects the finest ingredients for her restaurant.

They like the way they do things, they're not ashamed (unlike a lot of us South Asians, who try to hide from Westerners that we too eat with the right hand) and their ideas about service are a little different than what's common in mainstream American restaurants. \u00a0Ethiopians just don't like to rush dinner, and food should be provided in luxurious quantity, there shouldn't be just enough, there should be too much. \u00a0They're not really being stingy when they try to discourage two people from sharing a one person meal, it's just not really appropriate from their perspective. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you already know you like Ethiopian food, it's not just me, you can see here that lots of us think that this is the best Ethiopian cuisine in a town in spite of some serious competition. \u00a0If you're not familiar with the food, there's a trick to ordering the food. \u00a0Don't try to order a la carte, you want to maximize your choices by getting one of their combination platters, sized for the number of people in your group, the larger the group, the more variety you can get. \u00a0You want as many different stews ( something wat) and vegetables (something alecha) as are allowed by the combinations. \u00a0The meal then comes out on a large platter, on injera (the spongy bread staple), with more injera stacked up on the side. \u00a0The eldest gets to go first. \u00a0 \u00a0The injera is your utensil, use only your right fingers, scoop up the food with the injera (like South Asians do with rice, West Africans do with fufu), and push it all into your mouth with your thumb. \u00a0It's easier than it sounds, but like everything else, you get better with practice. Once they see that you're trying to do it right, then the waitstaff will be more helpful, but they're not inclined to give a lot of instructions as they don't like to assume total ignorance. \u00a0Ethiopians don't like being loud, Americans who are being direct and straightforward can sometimes be seen as confrontational in Ethiopian eyes. \u00a0Dignity and mutual respect are very important to them. \u00a0The more intrusive, brash waiter-waitress behavior we think of as good service in mainstream American restaurants is a little disrespectful in Ethiopian culture, they show respect by being quiet, low-key, unobtrusive. \u00a0You shouldn't misinterpret that to mean that they are disinterested in their customers. \u00a0Many of the non-Ethiopian customers are regulars, or already familiar with the way things are done, just like Chinese restaurateurs don't usually give chopstick lessons or coach people how to order rice and an appropriate mix of Chinese dishes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Try the honey-Tej wine, it's an acquired taste, but it's traditional and I think it balances out the spicy food well. \u00a0If you like spicy hot food, tell them, they have a nice red hot sauce that they don't offer usually unless you ask. Finish with coffee, Ethiopian coffee is definitely not to be rushed, smell the aroma first, then sip. \u00a0I've found that Ethiopians are almost ritualistic in the way that they enjoy, share and imbibe coffee, it's a special shared event.", "rating": "4", "date": [2013, 10, 6]}, "54": {"description": "This is one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in the city. \u00a0It's family-run and they are so helpful in helping you choose what to eat. \u00a0The restaurant and the bathrooms are extremely clean!

Seriously, I do. Which is why I can't give them just one star. It's a cool funky spot that has been a part of Rogers Park my whole life and in so many ways represents the neighborhood. Unfortunately, this place is extremely hit or miss, and my last time dining here was a definite miss.I must preface this by saying I have not had a bad breakfast experience here, so if you can make it for brunch, I would recommend checking it out. Sitting outside in the summer, eating and omelette and maybe having a bloody mary or mimosa on a saturday or sunday morning is really quite magical.Dinner on the other hand is another story. The last time I went there with my girlfriend I ordered the Chef Revival salad, and was served garbage. Seriously, it tasted like garbage. The lettuce was wilted and slimy and masked by an insane amount of french dressing. It was so disgusting I could not get the taste and thought out of my mouth for several days, and each time I thought about it, I felt like I would wretch. My girlfriend ordered the heartland stir fry with chicken. While the flavor was okay, the chicken was about the toughest, driest chicken you can imagine, bordering on inedible. The service is never that great but this past time was exceptionally mediocre. I wanted a beer and my girlfriend wanted a glass of wine. They were out of wine, so she ordered margarita. It was served unceremoniously in a pint glass and while it tasted okay, it definitely seemed like it was just some commercial pre-mix that you could buy in the store. I asked the server what Three Floyds beer they currently had on draft and he told me Apex Predator, a great beer, but produced by Chicago's own Off color brewing company, not Three Floyds. I ordered it anyways and it was great except it came out after my garbage salad even though I had ordered it before. After we ordered we didn't see our waiter again until the bill, when he apologized for getting slammed. It was Tuesday, more than half the tables were empty. I've been a waiter before and in no way was the restaurant slammed. He didn't bother to ask us how our meal was, ask if we wanted another drink, anything. This place could be great.

It's always moist, fresh and full of flavor.

I saw this one in TIme Out, decided to skip on Taco Bell for lunch and it was great!Quickly, the inside is much nicer than the average Mexican place, closer to a restaurant. The decor is fun, although they have a gigante flatscreen on one wall, so be aware if that's a plus or minus for you. More importantly, the \"patio\" is f---ing amazing. There is a 15' x15' area you could describe as a backyard patio (suburban grill, unused high chair, hoses) with about seating for 7-1 and a round outdoor fireplace.The remainder of the patio is AN ENGLISH GARDEN. I mean, the gardening is not Botanical Garden standards, but this is way beyond patio. We ate on a nice, intimate, metal table along a pebble-strewn path. There are tall hedges, flowering plants, shady trees, a rose bush. I am not greatly exaggerating to say I would get married here. Anyway, check out the photos, pretty nice.As for the food, I would say it was damn good overall. I'm not a Chicago Mexican-food scenester (if you are, go to Big Star = yum), but I was impressed. \u00a0I liked the pre-entree chips, which were crunchy but not crumble-flakey, and not ground-corn gritty. They came with refried beans and two salsas which were really good. The tacos were good, though I would want more seasoning. The quesadilla and enchiladas were cheesy, spicy and great. I also had delicious shrimp empanadas. Tasty, not-too-crunchy, not-too soft breading and good mix of shrimp, vegs and spice inside. The only thing I could have written off was the guac. It was too bland for me, but I DO go salt and cilantro crazy when I make my own.For drinks, we had tasty but pretty sweet margaritas, which were \"upgraded\" off-menu to be more fun. We had too many of them and drove up my bill, but otherwise, I'd say this was a $100 experience for $30-40:Same inexpensive tasty taco/burrito fare you'd see at most taquerias, but with the ability to order delicious entrees including beans and rice you'd pay way more for at a restaurant, all while watching a bumblebee collect pollen from the flowers one foot away from you.

Very nice, no frills gym, no contract, very easy to join. Includes a cardio room, weight room, some classes, nice TVs, wifi available, and a little supplement shop in the front. Only reason I give it 3 stars is because the classes aren't included in a regular membership--you have to pay $15 extra each month or something like that. Also, there isn't a lot of space to do things on the floor like push ups, crunches, or stretching. Cons aside, there are tons of pros. It's family owned by two brothers, and they're very polite and helpful. The women's locker room is SPOTLESS, and that's a huge compliment coming from a clean freak like me. As a woman that likes to weight train, I automatically noticed that there was an equal ratio of men and women in the weight room, with girls that were bringin' it! It's nice to not be the only buff girl :). Also, unlike Bally's a few blocks away, there is no weird singles vibe, and no creepers analyzing how supportive your sports bra is with their x-ray vision.

Wouldn't have thought I'd combine those terms when describing a salon in my neighborhood. But given that my first of many future visits to GingerSlam exceeded my expectations?Cheers to GS owners and staff \u00a0for bringing a Lincoln Park experience to Rogers Park. And at RP pricing...I'll get back to that. I love patronizing businesses when they're in their infancy, because you get to see how everyone performs under that type of operational pressure. GS has a solid team, with most of the core staff being friends for decades outside of the business. It shows--while the salon itself had the usual first-week kinks to work out, the team was a talented, charismatic and well-oiled machine. The interior of GS is sophisticated yet approachable, with a great balance of vintage glamour and modern aesthetics. There are three pedicure stations, which are light blue and white (think Marie Antoniette)--which pair well against the buttery-yellow walls and chandeliers. Two gorgeous pin-up girls adorn the walls, as well as designer logos and a flat-screen which was showing the classic \"Auntie Mame\" film from the 50s. While I enjoyed Rebecca's gentle yet effective pedicure care (the massage and exfoliation scrub were fantastic) to my winter-trodden hooves and talons, I gazed in horror at the customer's glass of wine next to me. I gasped when I saw her bottle of Merlot. As I did not have wine. And that is NOT supposed to happen when I'm getting a mani/pedi. Sure enough, there was a BYOB sign on the door. I made a mental note, sighed in relief and settled in for the rest of my pampering.After the polish was applied, I was taken to one of two manicure stations (another will be added) for the Ombre gel. Remember the Hypercolor t-shirts from the '90s which would change color when heat came into contact with the material? Imagine that wondrous effect on your nails. When they're warm (either through body temperature or exposure to heat), my nails change from their original deep salmon color (\"Crantini Bikini\"--which also looked pinker in the swatch than on my nails, guess my blood runs cold?) to almost Barbie hot pink--and when I was doing dishes they changed to champagne pink. When they cool down, they're back to their original shade--but I've noticed that the tips are usually darker than the nail bed (again, the body heat). So I basically have a non-stop party on my fingertips. And since each incarnation of the polish color matches my skin/undertones--I suppose I have an ultra-stylish soiree?Halfway through the manicure, I asked if GS offered Brazillians, as I was going to head to another salon for one but didn't have an appointment. Trevor then confirmed with the esthetician, Marshawn, that they'd be able to fit me in. \u00a0I'm no stranger to this procedure, but I was a bit wary of being ad hoc scheduled for one when 1) the esthetician's other scheduled client just walked in, and 2) it was my first time at the salon. While I didn't want the customer to wait unnecessarily, I also didn't want to end up with random fur patches.Neither happened.

Wouldn't have thought I'd combine those terms when describing a salon in my neighborhood. But given that my first of many future visits to GingerSlam exceeded my expectations?Cheers to GS owners and staff \u00a0for bringing a Lincoln Park experience to Rogers Park. And at RP pricing...I'll get back to that. I love patronizing businesses when they're in their infancy, because you get to see how everyone performs under that type of operational pressure. GS has a solid team, with most of the core staff being friends for decades outside of the business. It shows--while the salon itself had the usual first-week kinks to work out, the team was a talented, charismatic and well-oiled machine. The interior of GS is sophisticated yet approachable, with a great balance of vintage glamour and modern aesthetics. There are three pedicure stations, which are light blue and white (think Marie Antoniette)--which pair well against the buttery-yellow walls and chandeliers. Two gorgeous pin-up girls adorn the walls, as well as designer logos and a flat-screen which was showing the classic \"Auntie Mame\" film from the 50s. While I enjoyed Rebecca's gentle yet effective pedicure care (the massage and exfoliation scrub were fantastic) to my winter-trodden hooves and talons, I gazed in horror at the customer's glass of wine next to me. I gasped when I saw her bottle of Merlot. As I did not have wine. And that is NOT supposed to happen when I'm getting a mani/pedi. Sure enough, there was a BYOB sign on the door. I made a mental note, sighed in relief and settled in for the rest of my pampering.After the polish was applied, I was taken to one of two manicure stations (another will be added) for the Ombre gel. Remember the Hypercolor t-shirts from the '90s which would change color when heat came into contact with the material? Imagine that wondrous effect on your nails. When they're warm (either through body temperature or exposure to heat), my nails change from their original deep salmon color (\"Crantini Bikini\"--which also looked pinker in the swatch than on my nails, guess my blood runs cold?) to almost Barbie hot pink--and when I was doing dishes they changed to champagne pink. When they cool down, they're back to their original shade--but I've noticed that the tips are usually darker than the nail bed (again, the body heat). So I basically have a non-stop party on my fingertips. And since each incarnation of the polish color matches my skin/undertones--I suppose I have an ultra-stylish soiree?Halfway through the manicure, I asked if GS offered Brazillians, as I was going to head to another salon for one but didn't have an appointment. Trevor then confirmed with the esthetician, Marshawn, that they'd be able to fit me in. \u00a0I'm no stranger to this procedure, but I was a bit wary of being ad hoc scheduled for one when 1) the esthetician's other scheduled client just walked in, and 2) it was my first time at the salon. While I didn't want the customer to wait unnecessarily, I also didn't want to end up with random fur patches.Neither happened. The waxing area was prepped for me, initial questions were asked regarding allergies, and the general waxing procedure was explained. She stated that she loved the wax she would use on me, because it was efficient in x/y/z ways. And that the wax loved her. Good, as I didn't want the wax to hate her.

The tamale guy (are there more than one?) would come by the bars in Roscoe Village and I would be pretty hungry. They were skinny little things that needed lots of salsa. I wasn't too eager to buy them unless absolutely starving. The second time I came across tamales was at the Abbey Pub stand at Intonation Festival. Theirs was a delicious tamale filled with veggies with a side of spicy salsa to boot. This was when I fell in love. Since then, I pretty much order tamales whenever I see them, which sadly isn't very often. So clearly, when I walked by this place on my way to El Famous Burrito, I made a mental note to come back and try it. A store that ONLY sells tamales? How could I not? Despite consuming too many tacos, we stopped in to get some carry out tamales. They were really cheap (6 tamales for 6 dollars plus tax) and you get them really quickly. There are several varieties (pork - mild or hot, chicken - mild or hot, cheese and bean, cheese and jalapeno, strawberry and pineapple). Ended up picking up all of the savory tamales and ate them a few hours later.The actual masa part of the tamale is great. They're wrapped in corn husks and aren't dry. Yay! As for the fillings, the spicy chicken was delicious - moist dark meat with a fiery red sauce. Both pork tamales were exceptionally salty. I'm not sure if this was a one-time thing, but I'll probably try these again. I don't give up on foods with pork that easily. Both the cheese tamales were good too, but I just really prefer food with heat (i.e. spicy chicken). I will be back. In fact, I'm thinking of going this week. I was kicking myself for not getting the sweet tamales and then read that they taste like Twinkies? I must go back to there. But seriously, I absolutely love places like this. The lady at the counter just looked like she knew what to do in the kitchen and I'm sure there are multiple versions of her making these delectable creations back in the kitchen.

The first floor has some organization, with furniture and various knick knacks spread around at the front with jewelry. Most Halloween/theater costumes are further back on the first floor. There is a pretty good selection of the usual...flappers, pirates, princesses, etc. My first time here, I found a few 80s dresses and ended up buying one for a party. The basement has more general, vintage clothes along with all sorts of weird junk - old, creepy-looking dolls, rusty machines, a unicycle, old travel trunks and suitcases, etc. In my second time here, I found an awesome 70s dress in the basement while my friend got matching 70s-themed plaid pants and a tie. I also found a vintage coat that I would totally wear on a regular basis, and I plan on going back to buy it later. It's easily a coat that I would probably otherwise buy at some hip, vintage Web site for $50 and up, but it is probably super cheap at \"Lost Eras.\"I say \"probably\" because pricing is one of the downsides to this store. A lot of the items do not have price tags, and it seems that the only person qualified to price them is the woman who owns \"Lost Eras.\" When, for example, I tried buying items from a young man behind the counter during my second trip here, I was told that I'd have to wait for the owner to come back. Maybe that usually doesn't happen, but it was still slightly inconvenient.Also, since the store is disorganized, you can end up spending hours browsing the items while being distracted by everything else. Sure, i came in looking for 70s clothing, but wait...are those swords over there? On my second trip, my friend was mesmerized by the collection of bunny suits in the basement. (By the way, if you're interested, you can rent those bunny suits on a daily rate.) And it took me a long time to find my 70s gear; the clothing racks in the basement are tough to sort through.

Immediately neal attacked the waitress by asking her what she recommended on the menu. though flustered she was sweet and funny and pointed us to the tampiquena (skrit steak, mole enchilada, and guacamole) which husband ordered. Neal pushed further and a dish that wasn't available on the menu, a shrimp and pineapple concoction, was offered. Neal bit. Both of her recommendations were right on. the steak was sweet and spicy and tender and lovely, though we thought the mole was bitter and gritty. the shrimp dish was actually served in a half pineapple. the shrimp was mixed with some sort of ranchero sauce and cheese and fruit, etc. it was sweet and spicy, gooey, homey, comfort food. neal, when done with the shrimp itself, poured some rice into the pineapple to soak up the sauce. he ate that pineapple dry. julie ordered herself the chicken fajitas. they came out nice and charred with lots of red and green peppers. she took leftovers home. tasty.anne ordered the enchiladas with verde sauce. she got 4 huge enchiladas. the verde was very spicy, but she seemed happy. She also took home leftovers.i got the bum plate. i ordered the taco dinner with one chicken, one steak, and one pork taco. boo. The tortillas didn't hold up. The fillings were bland and riddled with gristle. The tacos were topped with iceberg lettuce and tomato. The beans were fine, a little runny, but tasted really beany. The rice was light and fluffy. Mild. Ultimately, though, I was supremely disappointed. But everyone else at the table was so pleased that I'd definitely consider going back. I'd just never get tacos again. The menu is large enough to sample other options. And on the front of the menu were the specials. I'd definitely order from the specials. That seemed to be where the real magic lived.Just to round out this review, we started with free chips, pico de gallo, red and green salsas. The red was bleh, but the green was very 'green' tasting, if you know what I mean. Good. And the pico was fresh and delicious. Very spicy. The chips were pretty light and fresh.

Service is quick and friendly. The restaurant is clean and welcoming with portraits of Frida Kahlo and paintings of places in Mexico.The food is amazing and priced to please. Some of my favorite entrees are breakfast dishes. The Desayuno La Choza is filling and satisfying with 2 eggs over easy, slightly spicy tomato sauce and onions on top, and rice and beans on the side. Served with fresh, hot, warm corn tortillas. The burritos and tacos are also a good deal. I like that they fill their burritos with the yummy stuff and not too much lettuce like El Famous.

And if you dont know much about the shoe game this isn't the place to go for a release as big as the 11s, that part I will agree. There are very few independently owned shops that will give info about a release like that over the phone and you will usually have to pay more because youre guaranteed the shoe (unlike chains like Foot Locker, etc). No, its not totally legit but \u00a0its how the game works, for better or for worse. I feel sorry for Nef because he clearly tried to walk in early and get a pair of shoes that hadn't been released yet, and I have the shoes now and had no problem getting them from PJs. So, if you want a major release, you can get it at PJs. I'd recommend going one or two days before and asking what the process will be. You may or may not get an answer about a raffle ticket. Then, camp out the morning before. When dude comes out and says they aren't selling them unless you have a ticket or whatever, stay there. Then, when they give you a price, pay it or walk away. Or, go before release day and pay double or triple retail of the shoe. If you aren't looking for a major release, its a decent shop. Kinda crowded. Has most decent Nike releases, definitely an urban/hiphop flair. Nothing is labeled with a price. Yes, the owner names the price when asked. Normally its about 20$ more than I think is reasonable, unless the shoe has been on the shelf for awhile. He's built a customer base on loyalty. People who go in there every week or every 2 weeks and buy shoes don't have to deal with the 20$ price markup or the run around over majorly sought after shoes. \u00a0Also, don't expect to bargain with him in front of other customers. Ultimately, I give them 4 stars because I've never had a problem getting a major release shoe. I've had friends tell me stories about waiting in line for hours and eventually not getting the shoe, and I've never waited for more than an hour or so and I've never walked out empty handed. \u00a0Its a reliable place to get all Jordans and a few other releases.", "rating": "4", "date": [2012, 12, 21]}, "0": {"description": "My son and I have been going to pj's since he was ten,he's 22 now and we have always had a friendly welcome.

The restaurant is run by a very nice couple, so it was cool that we were supporting the Rogers Park community!We ordered the jerk chicken (the special of the night) and the national Senegalese dish, which was fish. We were asked if we wanted a whole fish or just pieces, and the chef recommended getting the whole fish because the spices would be more prominent. We also got chicken pastels to start and I tried their ginger cocktail.Verdict? Excellent on all fronts. The chicken pastels were kind of like empanadas and the crust was super flaky. The filling was really flavorful too. The jerk chicken was the best jerk chicken I've ever had. It wasn't dry and the sauce for it was AMAZING (but definitely packs quite a bit of heat, so ask for it on the side if you're not the biggest fan of spicy food). The fish had this crazy crunchy crust and was doused in this really great veggie sauce. I felt like the crust was a little too crunchy for me, but my friend was a big fan. All the sides were really yummy as well - loved the rice, the veggies, the fried plantains... no complaints!The ginger cocktail was interesting. I'm a big fan of ginger and I couldn't decide if I liked it or not, but if you're into ginger ale or ginger tea, it's worth trying.

The chicken tasted just a bit better than the beef, but both were very good. The tomato and onion sauce that comes with it makes it even better. In terms of entree, he told us we couldn't go wrong with the Chicken Yassa or the Chicken Maffe. We decided that we would split both dishes. The Yassa was the best of the 2 as it was chicken infused with lime and caramelized onions...awesome flavor and couldn't put the fork down. The Meffe was good also which is chicken cooked with creamy peanut butter sauce. This dish was very rich and tasty.

I'm a big fan of ethnic foods so I've wanted to try this place for a while but there's no way I can sugarcoat my experience, everything was horrible.Our first indication that we shouldn't eat here was the number of people in the cooking area that didn't belong there. I'm talking about random people from the neighborhood walking through the door and having conversations with the people cooking right beside where the food is being prepared. This may be okay when you are serving family and guests in your own home, but it is not acceptable when you are serving paying customers in a \"restaurant.\" It's a sanitation issue plain and simple. There was no consideration given to this at Badou.Our second indication that we weren't going to be getting the meal we expected was the number of times we heard the MICROWAVE. I thought this was supposed to be authentic and fresh food? I'm not sure exactly what was being microwaved but I guarantee that the rice on both dishes was, and that couldn't have been all because it was being used constantly.Next was the service. To say that it was lacking would be a gigantic compliment. There is no excuse for how long we had to wait to order , how long we waited for our food to come, and how long we were held hostage after we had had enough and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.It was 15 minutes from the time we were \"seated\" to the time someone came and talked to us. The woman that finally came to take our order had just walked in from outside and luckily asked us if someone had helped us yet while she was walking towards the back. No one had said a word to us up until this point except Badou himself who had seen my wife looking at a picture of the lobster on Yelp and promptly told her \"we don't have that today\" and walked away. We put in our order for chicken coconut soup, chicken pastel appetizer, chicken made, and thiebou djen, all of which were discussed with the \"waitress\" and came recommended. 10 minutes later, the waitress comes back and tells us that they ran out of coconut milk so we can't have the soup... okay...Another 10 minutes goes by and the waitress comes out again and asks us if we want to have the beef fataya as an appetizer instead of our chicken pastel because it's already made. At this point I was becoming skeptical because I had been sitting and listening to the microwave go off over and over so I knew she was trying to just give us whatever they had in the back, so I declined thinking that the appetizer that we ordered surely must be close to being finished by now.

I'm a big fan of ethnic foods so I've wanted to try this place for a while but there's no way I can sugarcoat my experience, everything was horrible.Our first indication that we shouldn't eat here was the number of people in the cooking area that didn't belong there. I'm talking about random people from the neighborhood walking through the door and having conversations with the people cooking right beside where the food is being prepared. This may be okay when you are serving family and guests in your own home, but it is not acceptable when you are serving paying customers in a \"restaurant.\" It's a sanitation issue plain and simple. There was no consideration given to this at Badou.Our second indication that we weren't going to be getting the meal we expected was the number of times we heard the MICROWAVE. I thought this was supposed to be authentic and fresh food? I'm not sure exactly what was being microwaved but I guarantee that the rice on both dishes was, and that couldn't have been all because it was being used constantly.Next was the service. To say that it was lacking would be a gigantic compliment. There is no excuse for how long we had to wait to order , how long we waited for our food to come, and how long we were held hostage after we had had enough and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.It was 15 minutes from the time we were \"seated\" to the time someone came and talked to us. The woman that finally came to take our order had just walked in from outside and luckily asked us if someone had helped us yet while she was walking towards the back. No one had said a word to us up until this point except Badou himself who had seen my wife looking at a picture of the lobster on Yelp and promptly told her \"we don't have that today\" and walked away. We put in our order for chicken coconut soup, chicken pastel appetizer, chicken made, and thiebou djen, all of which were discussed with the \"waitress\" and came recommended. 10 minutes later, the waitress comes back and tells us that they ran out of coconut milk so we can't have the soup... okay...Another 10 minutes goes by and the waitress comes out again and asks us if we want to have the beef fataya as an appetizer instead of our chicken pastel because it's already made. At this point I was becoming skeptical because I had been sitting and listening to the microwave go off over and over so I knew she was trying to just give us whatever they had in the back, so I declined thinking that the appetizer that we ordered surely must be close to being finished by now.

Badou can accommodate vegetarians! Woo! He made a sweet potato maffe with peanut sauce and carrots that still haunts my dreams, it was so good. And a tasty savory pastry that was sort of like an empanada that was super good. Since I was here for a large event, my friend set up the menu with Badou beforehand and they discussed the fact that she would have some vegetarian friends, so for a regular dinner if you have vegetarians in your party, you might want to call ahead (since most traditional dishes are cooked with meat). But seriously, the vegetarian adaptations I ate were amazing. And my husband eats meat, so he ate like 5 different dishes and LOVED them. The made and the yassa were both huge hits.

Cebbu Djen.One drink I always hanker for during Christmas is sorrel, something that is very popular in Jamaica. I was quite happy to see that there was bissap on the menu, a drink made with hibiscus leaves just like sorrel. And it was just as refreshing. The curry soup was spicy, as I requested, and I swear this would be an idea autumn and winter soup. The fataya were also spicy the way I ordered them and if it were not for me going to a friend's home after leaving the restaurant, I would have ordered some for take-away. The cebbu djen was outstanding. The fish was meaty and seasoned well. Yes, it, too, was spicy. The djolof rice, cabbage, whole carrot, and eggplant would have made a rather tasty vegetarian dish without the fish.For those who like their food to arrive at the table within minutes of ordering, you may not be a happy customer. Clearly food is prepared to order and I like that because I'm assured that it's not being warmed up quickly in a microwave. There is something good about having food prepared to order.

My most recent carry out experience was too surreal to ever go back again. I called in the order, gave the cook and additional 30 minutes, got there 1 1/2 hours later for pick up, it wasn't ready. I was told the food would be done in 5 minutes, which wasn't true (25 minutes more accurate) I got my food and the fish wasn't prepared the way it is routinely prepared, which added another 45 minutes to the wait.

We came here on a Saturday morning with NO RUSH. The waiter took forever with everything -- to take our order, to come out with our food, and to even bring us our check. He also never checked in to see how we were doing or if we needed anything additional (like the dish that he forgot to bring to our table) -- he instead hung out by the bar to chat with his colleagues. Then, brought us our check without even double checking that my Groupon was not deducted from the total. I did not get the impression that he lacked the experience, but that he was just being careless. Next, the food. I ordered orange juice as well as the baked goat cheese, stuffed mushrooms, and the garlic potato salad tapas. The orange juice was delicious and the baked goat cheese and stuffed mushrooms were worth the try. The garlic potato salad was served to me still frozen, which ultimately ruined my appetite and made me wonder what else was not served to us fresh.Overall, Twisted Tapas was not worth my morning or my appetite.

The service was satisfactorily polite, and the dishes came to the table at a good pace.The burrito was incredibly mediocre. It was like an egg scramble with veggies and dry chicken breast drowning in melted american cheese wrapped in a grilled tortilla. Despite being so cheesy, this was somehow bland. The burrito was served with sour cream and a typical tomato, cilantro, onion salsa. One thing I did like about this dish was that the salsa was served in a soft, flexible silicon cup so that it was easy to aim where you pour on the burrito.The deviled eggs were ok as a whole, but really it was great and bad at the same time. The dish served 5 different iterations of deviled egg for you try to including a beet, bacon, and tuna. Visually, it was a beautiful plate. All the deviled eggs were too cold as if they were sitting in a fridge right up until it was brought to the table. Most of the deviled eggs tasted like grocery store deviled eggs (even the bacon one disappointed), but i absolutely loved the tuna one. I think it was made with sriracha mayo mixed into the yolk with raw tuna and topped with fish eggs. That bite was absolutely fantastic!The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but there was nothing special about them. I think they were stuffed with rice and topped with tomato sauce and cheese.The bacon wrapped dates were good with crispy, flavorful bacon, but i didnt like the sauce. It tasted like a creamy maple sauce, but i really have no idea what it was supposed to be. I was a little disappointed because this is usually a favorite for me when i eat at tapas restaurants.This meal had some good things about it, but i regret coming here overall. The food was just not good as a whole.

Several have told me, over the last year, that Best Massage had really good prices, on everything from tables to supplies. But, because I really didn't need much in the way of supplies, I never checked the place out.Finally, my holster that holds my massage oil when I work fell apart. I needed to get a new holster before I work this weekend. After teaching today, I made the trek to East Rogers Park for what is, for me, an essential supply.The store is located on the south side of Howard, only one or two doors west of Sheridan Road. There is metered parking on the street.The store itself is fairly well-organized. When I entered, I saw two men sitting behind a long counter, obviously busy doing something. I was not greeted when I came in.The place is not really that big, but it does have a few massage tables set up. The tables were easy to find - they're big. I saw some CDs displayed, along with linens, bolsters, different kinds of lubricants (oils, creams, gels), aromatherapy oils, and a few books. However, I was looking for something pretty small. I did not see what I was looking for, so I asked the two men if they carried holsters. I was told, yes, they did, and one man got up to show me where they were. I found them on a shelf in the back of the space. There was a typed/printed label on the shelf that was pretty small - at least, I sure didn't see it earlier when I was looking for it. The man pointed them out and walked away.I did end up buying a holster that holds one bottle, for $7.00. It was a reasonable price.The customer service was practically non-existent. The two men clearly were working on something - I don't know what, but they didn't seem to be doing anything to help a customer. Since the purchase was so small, I pulled out a $10.00 bill to pay. Well, that was a problem. One man asked the other \"do we have any cash?\" Gentle Reader, it was about 3:30pm. Was I the first customer of the day? Is it so old-fashioned to pay cash for a small purchase? Confronted with how difficult a customer I apparently was, I dug through my wallet and pulled out smaller bills and coins, so that I was offering $0.07 more than the actual purchase price. The man had to go to the back to find $0.07 cents.So, I got what I wanted. When I got back home, I looked at their website. My impression is, they really want to do website sales. I'm not quite sure why they even bother having a storefront, if they don't want to be bothered by customers actually walking into the place. According to the website, they've been in business since 1999. I don't know how long the storefront has been there.Would I go back again? Well, maybe. I mean, they weren't actually rude to me. They just had better things to do. Would they have given me more time and attention if I'd said, \"Hey guys, I'm a massage school teacher and I can send business your way.\"?? I don't know. It was pretty lax. If I need something desperately, I'll probably go in again. Or if I want to replace my table and want to see and touch tables so I can make a better purchasing decision, maybe I'll go again. In such a rough economy, every purchase should count. Every customer should count. If my shopping disturbs the work they need to do, maybe they should just close the storefront.

They found a used one, gave me a good price and fixed it while I waited. I was grateful as it was a gorgeous late fall day, and I'd planned a trek. The week afterwards, though, had to take it back in because it wouldn't shift. The guy that repaired it took more time and said that the shifter and derailleurs were so old that they didn't communicate well; I also needed another derailleur to go with the new shifter.

There was a great special on miller lite, well drinks, and 1/2 price appetizers on Monday, that we took advantage of, and they even let our group use a Groupon that is currently available. We had a great time as a group and felt well taken care of by the staff, who appeared to be sharing responsibilities in delivering our food and beverages. The wings were noteworthy. We tried the bbq, the habanero chipotle and the sweet Thai chili. All were good! I don't think anyone used the ranch dipping sauces. The buffer sandwich (buffalo chicken), which I had, was amazing. I really want to go back and have it again. Right now. It had the best grilled onions on it, which is weird, but gooood. I also substituted the ciabatta bun for a pretzel roll since all the guys who ordered burgers had that bun. I didn't taste one, but the burgers looked great (huge and delicious). I'll definitely try one some time. The fries were good, too, sort of standard and not meant to be the stars of the show. Another guy tried the mac n cheese balls, and he said they were great. I believe him, since he didn't share and didn't take his time eating them. There are TV's all over the place in this bar, and it should be a go to for catching the game. They could improve on the onion straws, not my favorite and the chicken fingers, we're sort of disappointing compared to the rest of the food. I think they were essentially the exact same ones you get from Jewel. I know they could do better there. Lastly, I think the service was good but there were some times when I felt it could have been even better.

Bless his heart, he flipped out more than I did (\"So you're really going to frisk just her and not me? Really? Are you...seriously?\"), and was then also frisked. And we also turned around and left.It's not the principle of being searched that's the issue. It''s that this place is evidently now attracting a crowd which led the restaurant to have to complete searches prior to entry to ensure patron safety.

I wasn't even going to post about this event (happened in March), but given that I've read several other online reviews where customers mentioned that non-white patrons were searched and white ones weren't?

There was a great special on miller lite, well drinks, and 1/2 price appetizers on Monday, that we took advantage of, and they even let our group use a Groupon that is currently available. We had a great time as a group and felt well taken care of by the staff, who appeared to be sharing responsibilities in delivering our food and beverages. The wings were noteworthy. We tried the bbq, the habanero chipotle and the sweet Thai chili. All were good! I don't think anyone used the ranch dipping sauces. The buffer sandwich (buffalo chicken), which I had, was amazing. I really want to go back and have it again. Right now. It had the best grilled onions on it, which is weird, but gooood. I also substituted the ciabatta bun for a pretzel roll since all the guys who ordered burgers had that bun. I didn't taste one, but the burgers looked great (huge and delicious). I'll definitely try one some time. The fries were good, too, sort of standard and not meant to be the stars of the show. Another guy tried the mac n cheese balls, and he said they were great. I believe him, since he didn't share and didn't take his time eating them. There are TV's all over the place in this bar, and it should be a go to for catching the game.

It''s that this place is evidently now attracting a crowd which led the restaurant to have to complete searches prior to entry to ensure patron safety.

My suggestion to the owner: this isn't working. Customer experience is getting worse.The staff are personally nice as always, but look increasingly flustered and often are glancing around the dining room looking confused. Every time I've visted recently there have been basic table service frustrations: no coffee for long periods of time, food time almost walk-out long (as I write, I sit at a table having arrived *54 minutes* ago but no food), food delivery without silverware (just saw it happen 3x in a row to ppl around me), not being able to get someone to grab a bill and run the check. Today when I was a the counter, a women was there ordering a scone for her table because she couldn't get someone to take the order at the table. Said she had waited 30 mins.3-stars stay because the staff are still nice and look like they are putting a lot of effort in and I still love the food and general vibe of the Rabbit, but simple table service that looks \"easy\" takes some training and *efficient systems* to care for customers well, and Rabbit hasn't caught up on this. I'm sure their plans for a new space will seem like the solution, but I am concerned this will not fix staff training or old systems. Hope they figure out a way to improve! Another table behind me just told the server they will leave without their food. Bummer.CR----Been in Rogers Park now for 8 months, and I've decided The Growling Rabbit is my favorite, and not it's not just cause their name is awesome (picture it in your head for fun. right?) \u00a0The handmade-chorizo omelette with fresh avocado, green onions, tomato, cheddar: huge and savory and perfect. Baked goods are: well, they're baking them in the back, so awesome. Staff are universally friendly and easy-going. The space isn't big (13 tables? + a counter that runs the width) but feels bigger because of big bright windows on all sides of the corner lot.This place typically hits that nice sweet spot between coffee-shop and cafe: on weekdays, you can easily camp with a laptop (wifi is pretty dependable) and enjoy coffee and a snack, or you can have a lunch-quality meal.They're busy and popular on the weekends which has had them recently switch to table service on Saturdays and Sundays--instead of ordering at the counter you wait to be seated.

My suggestion to the owner: this isn't working. Customer experience is getting worse.The staff are personally nice as always, but look increasingly flustered and often are glancing around the dining room looking confused. Every time I've visted recently there have been basic table service frustrations: no coffee for long periods of time, food time almost walk-out long (as I write, I sit at a table having arrived *54 minutes* ago but no food), food delivery without silverware (just saw it happen 3x in a row to ppl around me), not being able to get someone to grab a bill and run the check. Today when I was a the counter, a women was there ordering a scone for her table because she couldn't get someone to take the order at the table. Said she had waited 30 mins.3-stars stay because the staff are still nice and look like they are putting a lot of effort in and I still love the food and general vibe of the Rabbit, but simple table service that looks \"easy\" takes some training and *efficient systems* to care for customers well, and Rabbit hasn't caught up on this. I'm sure their plans for a new space will seem like the solution, but I am concerned this will not fix staff training or old systems. Hope they figure out a way to improve! Another table behind me just told the server they will leave without their food. Bummer.CR----Been in Rogers Park now for 8 months, and I've decided The Growling Rabbit is my favorite, and not it's not just cause their name is awesome (picture it in your head for fun. right?) \u00a0The handmade-chorizo omelette with fresh avocado, green onions, tomato, cheddar: huge and savory and perfect. Baked goods are: well, they're baking them in the back, so awesome. Staff are universally friendly and easy-going. The space isn't big (13 tables? + a counter that runs the width) but feels bigger because of big bright windows on all sides of the corner lot.This place typically hits that nice sweet spot between coffee-shop and cafe: on weekdays, you can easily camp with a laptop (wifi is pretty dependable) and enjoy coffee and a snack, or you can have a lunch-quality meal.They're busy and popular on the weekends which has had them recently switch to table service on Saturdays and Sundays--instead of ordering at the counter you wait to be seated.

The cashier for one, a mixed looking girl with black curly hair, ran out of the store in the middle of a line making customers wait . This was around closing 9:45 (the reason I am not sure I think to flag down a customer for a lost item or incorrect order) and came back to the cashier without apologizing or cleaning her hands! . \u00a0Not all but a majority of the new faces who work the line look nervous and the happiness from the ones who don't work the line with a blank face and an occasional forced smile doesn't seem genuine. Food wise no complaints .apparently They ran out of black beans for the day when I got there and also brown rice. I do realize it was close to closing and they wanted to get ready to close up and go home but lack of preparation to the ones working the grill. By now you should already know customers will still be coming in ordering those main items until 9:59. **Went back today (2/18/16) and the experience went from bad to worse. I walk in with only two people getting served on the sauce side of the line about to check out. The cashier I previously mentioned was now working the line. This time she straightened her hair. Go figure. I was not greeted when I walked in (there was no one behind me at that particular moment it was semi-slow) instead eye contact was avoided however she smiled and engaged in brief conversation with the other two customers who were together as if she didn't see me standing there. She then *very slowly* without a sanitizing rag cleans a very small spot of sour cream on the sauce side. By this time another customer walks in behind me and she gives me the one moment finger signal and she decides at that particular moment she needed to take off her gloves and wash her hands. Really. She did nothing but remove a small drop of sour cream on the line with a chipotle napkin and toss it into the trash next to her .Her gloves were clean as day. However she felt the need to wash her hands (That should've been done the day she noticeably stormed out of the store) . Anyways to make a long story short Im standing at the line waiting to get served as two more customers begin to come in after me. This girl has taken over 2 minutes of my time and then adds to it by SLOWLY washing her hands as if enjoying the fact she's making me wait and letting me know she doesn't want to serve me. At this point there's only her and another cashier on the line and someone from the grill notices people waiting on her to finish so they get another employee to take my order instead. (The girl is still washing her hands) and as the person serving me gets to the sauce side the rude a$$ finally gets back on the line and happily serves the next customer with a smile. *That is extremely petty behavior* I was so turned off I almost lost my appetite. I come here to eat not deal with attitude and self righteousness. Make my burrito or find another job. I have a feeling because I wrote a review a few days ago she put two and two together and since I'm a fairly attractive woman and me and my boyfriend have eaten here before (she flirted with my boyfriend the entire time of serving him) I was treated with less than expected customer service. That is not what a restauranteur should be. I have never in my life left out of a chipotle unhappy until today.

In \"The Hole,\" as it's known, you either have to wear leather (and not just a leather bracelet, which I was wearing) or take off your shirt. That's just during the week. Weekends, I believe it's underwear only, so beware!Boobs or no boobs, you gotta take off your shirt if you don't have the required amount of leather on. Oh, and I don't have boobs, but a girl who was hanging with my friend did have boobs. Luckily, she draped her long hair over them. She didn't seem at all uncomfortable with it and her boobs were nice to look at, so I suppose it wasn't too strange.But there IS a cage down there... AND you can get into it. I didn't climb in, but I saw someone get in, and I saw him do things to people while he was in it. Or maybe I should say I saw people do things to him while he was in there.Yeah.

Last time I was in there, he had some Zeniths, GMs, and Magnavox pieces from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. All the pieces are expertly restored with new cloth or finish, needles, etc. Some of the uglier pieces have been updated to a more \"modern\" color scheme with bright blues and oranges. An old radio was updated with a Bluetooth function for people who want to use their new technology on an older piece with warmer sound. There's something for every type of person who wants to participate in the vinyl lifestyle--no matter the age or experience of the buyer. There's stuff for the traditionalists and for those wanting something a little different.The record collection, though small, is great. I regularly frequent the reckless records stores in Chicago. They're terrific, but can be a bit overwhelming. You can always find a nice gem, but it takes hours of weeding through a lot of stuff to get to. The collection at Audio Archaeology contains only 40-50 albums per genre--but every album carried here is gold--be it a classic (from Miles Davis to BB King) to more contemporary fare (Black Keys, Flaming Lips, Ryan Adams, movie soundtracks, etc). Last time I was in there, there were racks out in the middle of the store that had some of the best Tom Waits albums--from the early years to his new stuff. Perhaps the best thing the store has going for it is the owner, John. Both times I was in there, John took time to walk me through what was new to the store--the history of individual pieces and his methods of restoration. There's something refreshing about his passion and transparency that makes one want to return to the store just to see what's new. However, with products this unique and in such great condition, I know that I won't be here to browse--I'm already counting on being a regular at Audio Archaeology.", "rating": "5", "date": [2014, 4, 6]}, "15": {"description": "This place is AWESOME!!!

And after a couple of YouTube videos on how to splice wire and hook up speakers, we bought it and had set up in about 2 hours (pretty damn proud, considering I had never done anything like it before).

So if you are a picky Trinidadian ( Like most of my relatives especially the Indian ones) and you are super picky about your spices, then you may deem this to be closer to Jamaican style spin on \"Trini \" cuisine.5.

Since moving to Chicago I have yet to find a Trinidadian spot that I wanted to visit; that was until I found Taste of Trinidad on Yelp 3 days ago. I went there that same night (Friday) and purchased a goat roti. The guy that served me was very nice; he told me he thought I'd enjoy the food and that I should come back tomorrow (Saturday) for doubles; because that's what I really wanted. Anyway, I left and it smelled so good in the car, I was ready to get home and get to it. I got home, opened up my roti and started to eat. Man, was that roti tasty. I mean, not just the roti skin, but the curry goat, potato & chick peas was all so delicious. I shared it with my husband and he was doubly impressed. We enjoyed that roti, just like the server said we would. And not only was the roti tasty, it was pretty big too. Next day (Saturday) I went back; purchased some doubles (thank God they had some for me), pholourie, jerk chicken lunch (with rice & peas) and a side of fried plantains. Let me just say that after all the Trinidadian restaurants I've eaten at in New York (and I've tried many), this restaurant in Chicago called Taste of Trinidad puts them all to shame. I can honestly say that this is THE BEST Trinidadian restaurant I've eaten from. The food is so flavorful its crazy. And the sauces they serve on the side.....OMG....they are a wonderful addition to the meals, but certainly not a necessary one. Fast forward to today (Sunday), and believe it or not, I was back at Taste of Trinidad for dinner. We purchased a goat roti (again), doubles (again) and the curry shrimp dinner (with rice & peas). My husband, my friend and I got home and we enjoyed our tasty dinner.Not only are the meals tasty, but the portions are so very filling. Next time I have got to try other menu items....I say next time because I am now a loyal customer of Taste of Trinidad.....visiting them 3 days in a row should say something. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant; the people working there are very friendly and the food is mmm mmm good. Like I said before, THE BEST I've had.......EVER!!!!Thank you to the cooks and staff of Taste of Trinidad.

First mistake was to do it on a Sunday night right before they closed. Second mistake was to do it at all. We had: Vegetable Delight - Overcooked vegetables in a heavy white garlic sauce with no real soup base- nothing exotic like a Buddhist Feast, just your ordinary run of the mill stuff with a few mini corns thrown in. Hard to imagine that this was really a Chinese dish. Vegetable Lo Mein -because they ran out of Chow Fun noodles (affectionately known in our household as greasy noodles.). This was mostly noodles with very few vegetables but at least it had some peapods. Hot Sour soup - this was overcooked and had reached a steady state of uniform brown. Perhaps it suffered from being ordered at the end of the day. Moo Shu Beef - came with 5 rather thick pancakes (sort of like the ones you have a breakfast), no plum sauce and scallions cooked to shreds in an already overcooked dish. It did not have tree ears or \u00a0tiger lily buds. It was better than everything else which is not saying much. In addition we got a free order of pot stickers. These were very large, greasy with some sort of mystery meat bouncing around in the hollow interior. Again, these appeared to be made long ago. We also ordered one spring roll (just to try) which was greasy and had nothing fresh or spring-like in it. When we picked up our order they forgot to include our Mango shake, and we had to ask for it. It appears they do not cook with lard (see a previous review) but use fresh vegetable oil throughout. Got lots of soy sauce packets (which had MSG in it - suggesting that they use msg in their food), but no duck sauce. It is hard to believe that this place is so successful that they have two branches and have recently moved to larger quarters. The four of us ate about half of every dish.

He offered me a 10% discount, but I refused the food since I realized I was no longer hungry and was full from my snacking while I was waiting.

And then I see here that the reviews are mostly positive -- overwhelmingly so. My experience was quite different. Let me start by saying that the food is very, very good. I'll get back to the food in a minute.Anthony greeted me at the door - I had made a reservation and he seemed to know it was me. I liked him right away -- friendly, gregarious, welcoming. I chose one of the traditional seats by the window, the kind where you take your shoes off and sit on a pillow. The rest of my party -- my partner and daughter -- arrived at 6pm. We ordered at 6:10 -- appetizer, soup, and two mains. The pot stickers were extraordinary -- fresh, delicious. The problem was they took 50 minutes. That was disappointing. While the waitstaff was running around like crazy, the restaurant was only about 30% full. The problem, it seemed, where the takeaway orders. Repeatedly, people were walking up to the counter only to be told that their order was going to be another 20 minutes. Some waited, some left and came back. Sometimes when they left and came back they were told it was going to be another 10 minutes. Most of the takeaway customers seemed to take it in stride. At 7:15 (over an hour after we ordered it), our Tom Kha Gai arrived. It was a generous bowl for $10 -- we barely made a dent in it. My daughter absolutely loved it -- it was her first experience with it. Tom Kha Gai in a Thai restaurant is kind of like Chili Rellenos at a Mexican restaurant for me; it's really how I judge the overall quality. This soup (this 65 minute soup) was outstanding. The chicken and the mushrooms were simply divine and the broth had a little heat but did not overwhelm the flavor. Meanwhile I was listening to Anthony taking a phone order -- an hour-and-a-half for delivery. Given that our main dishes hadn't arrived yet, I thought that was a little ambitious. At 7:45 our main dishes arrived. They were a mixed bag: the squid in black ink was amazing but the curry was weak both in flavor and ingredients. Now here's the kicker -- once we signaled that we were finished and ready to go, it was another 25 minutes before they returned with our food (which we had asked to be packed up) and the bill. That was extremely aggravating. The next day, when I opened up what I confidently thought might be a significant portion of the Tom Kha Gai for lunch, I found barely a 1/2 cup. I don't know if they spilled the rest or mixed my leftovers with someone else's, but that really pissed me off. While I don't want to discount all the glowing reviews I think there are some things going on at Thai Spice that need correcting. For starters, the kitchen is clearly understaffed (which happens in restaurants for lots of valid reasons). However, the front of the house needs to make this clear to customers. To be fair, the menu does state clearly that the food is cooked to order and, so, takes time. but over 45 minutes for pot stickers? Whatever the process is working in the kitchen should not bleed over into the relatively simple task of clearing dishes and totaling a bill. The prices, by the way, are reasonable.So we will be back but we'll probably order ahead or just do takeout. And if I order my favorite soup ever again I certainly won't trust them to transfer what I can't finish -- I'll do it myself. Finally, the entire front of the house needs to be (re)trained on two timeless service strategies: 1) never go back to the kitchen empty handed, clear finished plates away, especially when you've just been to the table to bring the next course, and 2) communicate with your customers. Let them know what's going on.I wanted so badly to really love this place. Clearly it deserves a second chance. But, at the same time, I think future customers need to be aware of the general confusion that my experience seemed to consist of.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 9, 30]}, "30": {"description": "My husband and I have been going to Thai Spice for at least 20 years.

A couple had canceled their reservation for the night and we were able to get a spot. When we got there, Anthony (the owner) was extremely warm and inviting and accompanied us to our seats. I'm not sure if this is the norm (Anthony had told us that his staff was on Christmas break and that he, his wife, and a few others were the only ones there to run the business over the holiday break), however, it was very nice to have the owner so engaged with the customers throughout the time that we were there. He was incredibly informative when it came to questions about the food that they served (from ingredients to the various levels of spice (1-5)), and also had a very warm and genuine candor about him that was a pleasure to be around, especially on New Year's Eve. The limited wait staff that was there was always very attentive in making sure that our glasses of water were filled and that we had everything that we needed throughout the meal. Service was an easy 5 stars.In terms of the food:Food Price: It was a little pricier than what we're used to for Thai food, both in the city and in the suburbs, however, there were two things that I felt justified the prices after going through the experience of eating there: 1) The serving sizes were quite generous. My girlfriend and I were not able to eat even half of our meals. And even the next day when I ate my leftovers, I still had some left. 2) The quality of ingredients and execution of cooking the meal were both very good. 3) As a bonus that night, the level of service was top notch. So ya, the food was more than worth it for the aforementioned reasons.Food Quality: As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food quality was excellent. The depth of flavor in my dish (Pad Thai) was phenomenal. I had initially asked for the highest level of spice that they had, but Anthony talked me off of the ledge and recommended I start with a Level 1 so that I could taste the quality of the food. I have never been talked down from eating a high spice level from any Thai restaurant that I've been to so that I could \"enjoy the flavor of the food\". He was right though - the 1 still had sufficient heat yet I was able to enjoy the food without sweating and begging for more water. This spoke to the pride that the owner had in the quality and flavor of his food. Many Thai restaurants, especially ones with subpar quality ingredients and a modest flavor profile, would relish in the opportunity of being able to smother a dish with max spice so that the inferiority of the meal's ingredients and flavor could be masked. Anthony was the opposite - he wanted me to taste the many nuances of my meal. In terms of ambience and environment, the lightning was inviting and warm, the restaurant looked relatively clean (our table was clean and prepared when we arrived), and the background music was at a comfortable level for this type of restaurant. They had pillows on the floor to sit on next to the windows for those who like to enjoy Thai food in that fashion. Aside from that, there was nothing that stood out to me as positive or negative here.To sum it up, their service was excellent, their food was excellent, and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable. Anthony is a fantastic owner and a pleasure to be around. Whoever is cooking in the back (I believe his wife was on NYE but I'm not sure if this is the norm) knows exactly what they are doing.

The parking lot seems to be a hot spot for being patted down by the police", "rating": "3", "date": [2008, 3, 2]}, "11": {"description": "I've shopped at Family Dollar for years, usually not by choice.My most recent experience with Family Dollar has made me re-think buying anything at all there. It was a blisteringly cold day (12\u00b0F/windy), and I was wearing a bulky leather coat with a hoodie (with pockets) underneath. I was also wearing thick snow boots that make a loud squeaking sound when I walk on tile floors (such as they have at Family Dollar). Why am I describing my wardrobe? You'll understand soon. I should note that I was *not* carrying a bag of any kind. I mention that because Family Dollar has a strict bag check policy, pretty normal for Rogers Park.As I entered the store, I nodded to the cashier, who smiled and nodded back to me, a rare occurrence at Family Dollar. Please note: at no time did she say \"hey, you need to check your coat\".I went to the back of the store to grab some plastic coat hangers, and decided to see if they had any interesting Christmas stuff on sale. It was at this time I noticed a man following me around the store. He was rather unkempt, with uncombed hair, wearing a dirty gray hooded sweatshirt with a black shirt underneath, wrinkled pants, and old shoes. My first thought was that it was a homeless guy who had come into the store to get warm.I started toward the front of the store, to the registers. I stopped to check out the kitchenware aisle, as my wife had mentioned that we needed a new utensil holder. Seeing nothing I liked, I started again for the front of the store...to find my path blocked by the same fellow who had been following me around the store, now staring at me.I asked, \"Is there something I can help you with?\"He didn't reply directly, instead he mimed I movement I thought meant he was implying that I was fat, moving his hands up and down his mid-section. He then said, \"You seem to be carrying a lot of stuff.\"\"Do you mean in my pockets?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" he replied.I then asked, doubtfully, \"Do you work here?\"\"Yes.\" he replied.\"Is there a manager on duty?\" I asked.He said, \"I'm the manager.\"Ah. Well. I then asked, \"Would you like to search me to see if I've stolen anything?\"\"Oh, I'm *going* to search you.\" he said.Uh, no. \"Without my permission? I don't think so. At least not without the police being involved.\" I said.\"I already called the police.\" he replied.So, let's recap: me = not a shoplifter. The \"manager\" = dressed as a homeless guy (loss prevention camouflage? or just a slob?), rude, called the police even though no crime had actually been committed.I asked him his name. He seemed to have to think about it (or come up with a fake name), then replied, \"Tony.\" I then asked him if he was the store manager, or an assistant. He didn't answer. I asked who his district manager was. No reply. I asked him if he was accusing me of theft. No reply. I pointed out that a shoplifter probably wouldn't wear such loud boots, as I would think that they tend to want to keep a much lower profile; \"Tony\" just shrugged.I asked \"Tony\" where he intended to carry out his \"search\" of me. Again, no reply.I decided to take pre-emptive action: I walked up to the registers, found an unoccupied counter (under one of the many cameras they have in the store), and emptied my pockets. Every pocket I had. My sunglasses. My gum. My keys. My wallet. My change. Everything. I invited \"Tony\" to pat me down or check my pockets for himself. No response. I asked him if I could go ahead and buy my coat hangers while we were waiting for the cops. No reply. I gathered up the contents of my pockets, and took my hangers to the open register, where the nice cashier I'd seen on the way in shrugged at me, smiled again, and rang up my hangers. I paid (with a bank card, a wise move considering what happened next), and at this point \"Tony\" told her to cancel the sale. Too late, though. He told her not to give me a bag or a receipt, though. He also said I wasn't allowed in the store ever again. So petty. At this point, the cops arrived. I knew the main cop, named Conway, from around the neighborhood. He asked \"Tony\" (who he didn't call by any name, and I was too angry at that point to think quickly enough to confirm \"Tony's\" name) what the problem was. He explained that he had *asked* if it was okay if he searched me, and I had refused. Uh, no.I told my side of the story, that I thought a crazy homeless man was following me around the store, that, indeed, \"Tony\" hadn't *asked* me ANYTHING, and that he'd called the cops *before* he'd even interacted with me. Conway asked \"Tony\" if this was true, and he stammered some bullshit response, not actually answering the question. Conway told me I could go, and apologized that I had been detained.I'm not sure I learned anything from this experience, except that \"Tony\" is an asshole, and not very good at his job. I'm glad that there is a Target opening up close to my neighborhood soon, so I'll soon have a better option for cheap plastic hangers.", "rating": "1", "date": [2010, 1, 3]}, "8": {"description": "This store looks like something from a 3rd world country.

The food's just \u00a0great and the couple that own and run it are the very nicest, sweetest \u00a0people! It's the only Chinese place within a mile. It beats to death the 2 others north of it past Lunt st. I love a number of dishes here having learned about them by breaking my --- stick with the \u00a0'tried and trues' rule. The reason i broke my rule was because Dragon Gate's so close that i eat here constantly, so i was forced to try other things fso that i wouldn't burn out, know what i mean Verne? My 'tried and true' rule is for places that i go to infrequently where i don't want to risk having a disappointing meal and i have a craving for some particular thing that i like there.Everything I've ever had from these wonderful folks has been good so I'm not afraid to try things. In fact, sometimes I'll request a special concoction or an extra this or that in the dish and it always turns out good. Their prices are very reasonable too. If you like Chinese food you won't be disappointed here!Things i especially like are pepper steak (with $2 of extra meat), pot stickers, combo fried rice with extra veggies, combo egg foo young (that's still great the next day when its egg foo old), curry dishes, teriaki chicken (all dark meat - yum, yum - a welcome relief from all the damned chicken breast everyone serves nowadays) and the list goes on....Dragon Gate is primarily take out but there are a couple of tables for a quicky meal. Parking's good because this part of Clark st. is not packed with stores. There's nearly always a convenient spot right in front or across the street. They close at 9 pm and on Sunday's.I know someone's gonna soon notice that i give all 5 star reviews or i don't give one. That's because I'm easy to please and i don't much let small slights irritate me. It's especially true because i'm a businessman who tries to always give great service to my customers but because this is an imperfect world full of flawed people (especially me) cannot always do so. Like Ricky Nelson sang - ya can't please everybody, so ya've gotta please yasself. I don't want to suffer a bad review without a chance to right a wrong, so i give other businesses a lot of leeway to do so.Therefore when i encounter a flawed business but i see that the owners / managers are really trying to do it right, I'm not going to drop any stars and hurt them. However, if i think that they're not bustin' ass tryin', \u00a0you'll hear me yelp about it from the throne, yessiree bob!

Would easily make the drive to restaurant, regardless of where I was in the city, as they had some of the best tacos in the city. Now that I live less than a mile from here, ironically I have dined here so infrequently that you would think I lived in Hyde instead of Rogers Park. The quality of their food has diminished enough to where, if I searched, I am sure I would find comparable alternatives. But since an excellent taco is rarely on my must-have list, I often settle for the good-enough options here...lesser of two evils, I suppose. [Note: this review is only about their tacos.]Their veggie tacos used to come with roasted corn and peas, an excellent vegetarian pico de gallo, and seasoned rice which was light and fresh. \u00a0Likewise, their tortillas were heavy enough to support their fillings, but no more--not so dense that you could eat them by themselves for a meal. Each of their meat tacos contained an easily identifiable part of an animal, with meat lightly fried and topped with enough herbs (mostly cilantro) and veggies so that each flavor of the taco came through. Flash forward a few years. Their tortillas are chewy and often stale tasting. Their meat tacos are so laden with oil that even if I knew which critter was inside the tortillas? It would just taste like greasy meat taco #1 (smothered in onions and cilantro), #2 (smothered in \"sauce\" and \"huh?\") or #3 (you do not even care at this point, you just need something reasonably non-bleh to eat)--enough of a distinction to separate the al pastor from the beef, but is that even beef in the first place? A previous reviewer mentioned the gristled quality of the \"beef\" in her tacos, which was accurate. I have left several of their \"beef\" tacos outside for street animals to munch on, as I am sure they get a bigger kick out of it than my struggling to chew the meat. The veggie tacos are so laden with bland and soggy rice that they really just seem to be a pity option for those who cannot/choose not to eat meat. Which is a shame as their veggie tacos used to be excellent. Again, I cannot vouch for the quality of their tortas. I will note, however, that whenever I have visited this place, diners seemed consistently happy with their tortas, which appeared to be well-made but pork-heavy. Plus, there are more than 100 of them, so a batting average of all of them being ick is highly unlikely. Speaking of which, they put diced ham on top of their pico de gallo. This has remained quite delicious over the years.

You can get delicious food from Heartland brought over, and the drinks are reasonably priced. There's a pool table near the window, and a Ms Pacman / Galaga machine near the door. And if you come here more than three times, it really could end up being the type of place where \"everybody knows your name.\"The best part is the Thursday Open Mic, hosted by the smooth, mellow-voiced Micki. In a time when most open mics in this city are seeing a recession-based lack of turnout, this one is thriving. And it's no wonder: Micki and the crew make everyone feel at home, and if you go enough, you become part of the family whether you like it or not. It's a fantastic little community.If you're looking for a sparkly clean, upscale place with bad cover bands, this joint probably isn't for you.

I guess I understand why the people who work here are so rude. When you have terrible management, your employees will be lousy. Not only will I never ever go here, but I'll also never go to Heartland Cafe solely because I've heard that they're owned by the same people. Also- someone named Everett from the bar emailed several other venues and blacklisted this band because of the bad reviews. Not good form.*****I really hope the manager or owner reads this for the sake of this business. Your employees are complete and utter (word that I will refrain from using so yelp doesn't remove my review). I have never been to a place which requires customers to survive and been talked to and treated so rudely. Literally in my entire life. The sound guy is just mad at the entire world and treats everyone that he comes across like they just stole his wife. First of all, I was with a band- two girls loading in a full drum set. Those things are incredibly heavy if you can imagine. We had walked for .5 mile in like a million percent humidity because it had just rained. The guy not only didn't offer to assist in any way- I had to specifically ask where to go whole he stared at us blankly- but he told us \"you need to hurry\" & \"make it quick\". Um hello dude this stuff weighs a good 80 pounds at the very very least. Chill. \u00a0You can wait 5 minutes. Then since I wasn't technically in the band he kicked me out of the back, very rudely. His overall tone was demeaning and horrible. The first band had some major sound issues with one of the monitors. It was so bad that they had to stop and couldn't go on until it was fixed because it was killing everyone's ears. But the sound guy who was so rude to everyone? Had left on his bike. The bartender who didn't know much about sound had to come to the rescue and figure it out. Well the sound guy finally showed up then cut the bands set short by HALF even though they couldn't play for 10 to 15 minutes because he had decided to leave the building. Then he was completely rude to the band about it! I saw a band member try to shake his hand and he literally wouldn't shake it. I've never seen a guy so rude in my life. The door guy was much more polite but wouldn't let someone who had just finished playing drums for 45 minutes was outside with her own gear with a cup of water. \"No beverages outside\". Dude- it's water, and it was backstage- not technically outside.To be fair- the only other employee here was the bartender and he seemed nice enough.Moral of the story- don't be rude if you want continuing customers. I actually live very close and if I had liked the place I would probably be a regular.*Update: Someone from the bar commented and I didn't want to leave it unaddressed.The person said that the sound guy didn't leave that he was helping the second band load in. This is a lie because I was helping the second band load in and they were completely finished loading in by the time the first band started- because i watched the first bands entire (very short) set. I physically SAW the sound guy ride off on his bike. So the sound guy is lying to you. Also- the first band most certainly did NOT cut their set short. Everyone in the bar could hear the band ASK the sound guy over the mic to let them play more songs since they couldn't play with the sound issues earlier. I'm sure they would be very upset to see that comment because they weren't to excited to get their set cut short.Second- the comment states that the sound guy isn't there to help load band's gear in. I believe you're missing the point of my review- no band actually thinks the sound guy or any other employee of a bar/venue is there to help with their gear. The point I was making was that he unlocked a gate- then didn't even bother to maybe hold it open like a decent human- to a really long alley area. We had never been there before and he didn't bother to tell us WHICH of the 5 doors we should put our stuff next to where they can load into the stage. We had to ask ANOTHER band member because the sound guy wouldn't answer us, other than \"make it quick\" and \"please hurry.\" Third- i just don't believe that the police issue tickets/violations for water. You can't make me believe that. Especially since we're backstage not even technically outside of the building. Fourth- I most certainly will not be back because the \"i'm sorry you didn't enjoy your time\" but here are all the excuses for bad behavior to your customers just goes to show that this place won't improve.

The sleazy beer here is from Huber [Monroe, WI.], which I encourage you to have. The down part of the visit was that it was _out_ of two beers which it publicizes having on special on Sunday night. I wonder if that was due to Heartland being closed for some days (and thus, not accepting deliveries of _anything_ related to food).I did not eat anything here. That was not due to Heartland's sanitation violation. But I had an enjoyable time. The beers were good, and a good value for the money. I did not have to pay the cover for the music.

If you're not from the area, you'll be circling the neighborhood for a good half hour before you find something and you'll be walking a ways to get there. A church on Ashland and Morse has free parking until specified times every day, so that's a good option. I had to pay $7 to see my boyfriend's band play. On a Sunday. Are you serious? The bar was empty and they still charged cover. There was a festival going on but no one was coming in and there were only two local bands, so that's a little much. The bathroom was the scariest thing I've ever been in. Tiny little toilet and sink, writing all over the walls and mirror. It's only the one toilet, so good luck if by some miracle this place is crowded. By the end of the night, there was no toilet paper, so I used paper towels. Shadiest bathroom ever.As for other random annoyances: some guy was allowed to bring his giant dog into the bar. At first I thought it was a service dog, but then it was let off it's leash and started going up to people looking for food. I love dogs, don't get me wrong, but what if there is someone who is afraid of dogs? Is it okay to have a huge one roaming around the bar freely? Me thinks not. After my bf's band was done, I helped move equipment to the back so the stage could be clear. Once I was done, I stood in the back for not even two minutes, and was told by one of the employees that I couldn't be back there. So it wasn't a problem when I'm moving stuff, but once I stop, then there's an issue? They were the last band to play, the bar was dead, and I was obviously with them so what's the problem? That annoyed me a lot, especially since another girl was back there not doing anything, but she wasn't told to leave. Maybe if I had worn my hipster gear, he wouldn't have said anything but since I didn't fit in with their scene, then clearly I was going to steal my bf's equipment and cause havoc. Whatever. This place is a dump. If you like to drink piss beer ($1 PBRs) and feel uncomfortable, come on down. There's no excuse for such a crappy bar.

When the server plopped the pizza down on the table we both looked at it as if an alien had landed. \"I thought we had ordered a thin crust\" I told the guy. \"This is thin crust.\" he said with a smile. The pizza presented was at least three times as thick as it should be. At the outer crust it was puffy and the sauce and ingredients stopped about an inch from the edge. When I took a square and bit into it, it was obvious that this was a frozen pizza. It was awful. Worst thing about this visit to Leona's is that I brought a friend from New York. New Yorkers are horribly smug about that slimy street food they call pizza. I had assured him that Chicago pizza was not the thick deep dish that he always made fun of. \u00a0I had to eat my words along with that disgusting garbage that Leona's had served us.

It took much adversity to even make it to check out as their website is not user-friendly in the slightest bit and navigating the website took a lot of guessing and clicks to get to where I wanted. But alas, I stuck through and reaped the benefits.We got:-Calamari: our calamari was a bit soggy and overall not the right texture you would want calamari to be.. Pass..-1/2 rack of ribs: the meat was a bit dry, needed to slather on a lot of the extra BBQ sauce they provided-Spaghetti with marinara sauce: this was the biggest disappointment for me as I've always been a fan of their angel hair marinara. However, this spaghetti was the only thing remotely similar, so we opted for this option. It tasted like any spaghetti you could make at home with Ragu sauce.-Bacon cheddar burger with a side of potato wedge fries: the fries were soggy and definitely undercooked. The bacon cheddar burger was dry and just bleh..-bleu cheese burger (forgot the name): same deal as the bacon cheddar burger in terms of meat. I couldn't even taste the bleu cheese, but definitely over killed my burger with onions and mushrooms.Overall, the food is nothing special and overpriced..

No option of soup or applesauce or fruit or anything like that for kids? Absurd.The food was also terrible. My son had the chicken tenders of which he had two bites because well they had the consistency of rubber. Nice job overcooking them in the microwave! I had the chicken parm sandwich which had about twice as much bread as needed given the small portion of meat inside.

The tour started with the Rogers Park Fruit Market. This market caters to Jamaican/Caribbean clientele. Here we learned about some of the different types of white breads. They were half-leaven bread since when the bread and yeast was first introduced to the Caribbean the yeast did not do so well in the hot and humid conditions. The bread was pretty heavy and dense. The butcher had different cuts of goat for the locals. We tasted some epizote as well as saw some yucca and cactus pears that seemed to be common theme of all the markets. Two things we bought were a sweet lemon and a sour orange to try later at La UnicaSupermercado Chapala was the second stop of the tour. This Mexican grocery store sells fresh produce, memorable guacamole and specialty items such as Mexican sour cream. There is an eating area with about 10 little booths where you can eat some the best carnitas around and roast chicken. They also have a selection of tacos like cabeza tacos. The store was packed when we went in on a Monday morning, it might have been due to the heavy thunderstorm, but people looked pretty happy to be there.The next place was La Unica that has food for all types of Latin cuisine. Some of the unique items I saw were the quince and mango jellies that were sliced and place on crackers with cheese to provide a sweet contrast. Block and cone sugar and chocolate was interesting to see as well as purple corn. People of the Andes make a refreshing drink from purple corn called \"chicha morada\" which is now recognized as a nutritive powerhouse due to its phenolic content. The interesting thing was the eating area to the side. Walking past the store front, one would never know that it has a restaurant in the back. We took a little break and tried a few foods; yucca (pan fried?) with some picked onions and two types of plantains. The yucca was very starchy and dense. It tasted like a potato, but was a little grainier. I could see how the yucca could make food go a long way because it was filling. We also had a fried sweet yellow plantain that was tender almost creamy. The green plantain was lightly fried and then pounded flat and fried again. It was like a very dense potato chip with just a light hint of sweetness. The sweet lemon and a sour orange we bought from the Rogers Park Fruit Market added a nice amount of acidity to the plantains and cut some of fat. The rest of the menu was pretty varied including Cuban sandwiches and some Peruvian dishes. The next stop was the Devon Market that caters to mainly Eastern Europeans. Here we see a lot of the same fruit and vegetables. They have a wide variety of wines form Eastern European countries such as Romania. The great thing about this market is the freshly baked bread. As you start to approach the bread section, the scent of freshly baked bread begs you to take a look. From what I remember a huge loaf was about $1.59. They also had fresh bread stuffed with cheese, meat, spinach or a combination of the three.Thai Grocery store was next. In the back, they have a place where you can buy freshly fried fish. Other things of note that I saw were Thai eggplant and Luk Chup (fruit-shape desserts made of mung-bean flour with natural coloring). As we were walking out of the store, we saw a stack of the infamous durian. There were quite a few so I wondered who buys this on a regular basis.Middle East Bakery was the next stop. Here we got to see all sorts of interesting grains and lentils. This was the first time I saw red lentils and red rice. We sampled Za'atar which I had only seen on Iron Chef America. \u00a0They were many interesting desserts like a jar or nuts filled to the brim with honey and raisin and walnut sausage. Yes, I said sausage. They string raisins and walnuts together and dip it in honey to form multiple layers. Lastly the sample of fresh savory pastries stuff with chicken, broccoli, cheese, olives or a combination of the three was great. I hear that he sells these to Whole Foods. So you can actually buy from the source.The next two stops were Fresh Farms and Patel Bros on Devon. As you walk into each of these store you are bombarded with the scent of spices, it almost knocks you over. They had things that I had never seen like fresh red and white (no blue) \u00a0tumeric, black radishes and fresh dates. From looking at the freezer sections, it seems that you can get just about any For $35 you get to have a fun 4 hour tour, learn some new things, enjoy great company and best of all eat and experience new food.

Even with the cold draft coming through the door the atmosphere was warm, friendly, and down to earth.The Arroz Con Pollo ($12) came with a large serving of cilantro rice with bulky pieces of bone-in drumsticks and thighs. The rice was stir-fried to perfection, with flavors inspired by a mix of cilantro, garlic, chicken, peas, and other spices embedded. Wonderfully delicious and addictive. Highly recommend it.The Arroz Con Marisco ($18) included plenty of shrimps, mussels, crab legs, scallops, red bell peppers, peas, large clams, and yellow rice. The scores of seafood were visible, fresh, and perfectly executed without them becoming shriveled or overcooked. To extend the flavors, both elements and complexities of the seafood were nicely cooked into the yellow rice. The flavors were not as robust as the previous dish, but a few drizzles of green spicy aji made it worthwhile for us.The complimentary bread was soft and fluffy, and the aji sauce was full-bodied spicy, thick, and out of this world delicious. I've visited plenty of Peruvian restaurants and this is the best aji sauce I've had so far. They were so kind to offer us complimentary homemade Lucuma Ice Cream after we had inquired about it with the server. The dulce de leche combined with a finesse but noticeable butterscotch-like flavor. The texture of the ice cream was thick but lacked creaminess. However, it still encompassed all the great qualities that are lacking in many ice creams that tend to melt way too quickly. It was the perfect dessert to end a fabulous home-like meal.It was home-style cooking at its best. Service was warm, friendly, and efficient.

Simple dish executed to perfection. Arroz con Mariscos: 4.5/5 -- Speaking of delicious and flavorful rice, this dish definitely hits the spot as well. This is a plethora of seafood mixed into one incredible dish. All the seafood was very fresh and appetizing, except for the clams. Clams not as fresh as expected. Lomo Saltado: 4.5/5 -- This one was amazing as well. Honestly, all three dishes described thus far were outstanding, but I would recommend this over the other two for its uniqueness. Delicious stripped beef cooked with tomatoes, onions, AND fries. Never tried anything like it. Anticuchos De Carne O Pollo: 3.5/5 -- This dish included both chicken and beef. While the chicken was tender, chewy, and flavorful, the beef was lackluster and not the freshest. Tamales with Chicken: 3.5/5 -- Pretty good but nothing compared to the first three dishes above. Nevertheless, it was soft and full of flavor (surprise, surprise). The service is lackluster. The owner didn't leave us along for ten minutes straight (a long time), even though we wanted the space. We also had to wait thirty minutes for the check (ended up asking three different times). Nevertheless, definitely glad that I came across Taste of Peru this weekend. So much flavor!

If you just want a cut and Shiva is busy, you're going to have Ali. I've had both of them before, and have always brought in pictures of what I wanted.I used to have Shiva highlight my hair (it's a pixie cut), and she always did a great job and I was always pleased with the color. However, when I went platinum, she didn't bleach it enough and I had to come back and have her do it again, since the first time my blonde hair looked orange. Due to this and the price, I have since started coloring my hair at home. When she cuts it, she kind of goes by the picture I give her, but it's never as close as I would like it to be. It seems like she ends up doing her version of it.As far as Ali goes, I think he honestly does what he wants. He'll take the picture I bring in and use it as a guideline, and end up doing what he thinks is best, which is usually on the scissor-happy side. My hair grows quickly so I usually don't care if it's a little too short, but it's still not exactly what I anticipated.With both of them, I usually end up liking my haircut in the end, but it's never my initial vision of what I bring in.

I told her I needed my whole hair dyed- I was a blonde, that went back to my natural black hair at another salon, and it was now starting to turn a coppery dark brown (yuck). She confirmed with me that the hair color was much lighter than my natural dark locks. When she put on the hair dye, she massaged it through my scalp- \u00a0(Which is awesome! I think this helps making the color actually get in ever strand). I waited in a comfy chair for like 40 minutes, she checked it, washed it out, and asked me if I wanted it blow dried and styled for an additional $15. I said no thank you.But she ended up blow drying it a little bit anyway, making sure the color was how I wanted it. She did such a great job! I will be returning here in the future. I think it cost around $48? It was a few months ago, so I can't remember the exact price.

Personally, I call it the little market that could!It is true that the first day, our vendors were taken by surprise with the turnout. There were 1000+ people there that first Sunday. We got feedback that they had never seen anything like this on an opening day of a new neighborhood market. Rogers Park just went and exceeded their expectations! The other thing our vendors have told us they have not experienced before is the level of enthusiasm and community support. We have volunteers showing up at 7am Sunday to help vendors unload!The truth is we have a farmers' market desert in RP and the demand is huge- we and our vendors are doing our best to meet that demand. We are actively seeking organic fruit growers, however people looking for fruit should keep in mind that it is still early in this region for fruit. More will be coming as the season continues.Since opening day, we have added several more vendors and the block is now full. Also, vendors have increased supplies and far less people are going away empty. The first day we did have an issue with cars being towed but that has improved greatly also.Sheree Moratto is a fantastic Market Manager with a can do attiude and generous spirit. I know the board appreciates your constructive feedback and I will pass it along to them. We are working hard to meet the demands of the community and raise awareness about what local food means.

This cafe is only a few blocks away and I am so disappointed that THIS is what is being offered as my local cafe.So, my reasons for dislike:First of all, the staff. I have never before been confronted by such a miserable, rude, lazy bunch of bastards in my life. You walk in, happy and smiling, looking forward to a nice drink, maybe a snack, a sit down....and you are met at the counter by some surly \"dude\" staring at you as if you've just taken a dump on the counter. \"Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you with my simple and polite request for some coffee! I'll let you finish your phone call, allow you to look me up and down a few times and then decide that, for completely inexplicable reasons, that I am not cool enough! Judge away!\".Secondly, the drinks, while drinkable, are not too good. I have had a number of coffees, hot chocolate and a couple of teas. Coffee tastes burnt....a weird mix of watery burn. The hot chocolate is simply powdered from a box with some hot water. The tea (bag...but whatever...) is massacred by barely warm water served in a chipped and dirty pot. Not good.Thirdly... and this is an odd one....every time my partner and I have been there, someone always confronts us about where we are sitting. I'm not talking a staff member pointing out that maybe we have strayed onto someone else's table who was in the bathroom or something. I'm talking some hostile other customer who has taken it upon himself to take personal offense at the table we have chosen to sit at, all because THEY wanted the table for themselves....even though they were already sitting at a table....and always brought up several minutes after we have started on our beverages. Strange. FInally, and others have mentioned this, the place is dirty. Dirty tables, floor, cups, spoons....just generally grimy. I can't really give any good points to be honest. They have the gall to have a sticker up, stating that \"Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks\", while completely disregarding the fact that they have modeled their store, menu and ordering system on exactly what Starbucks has been pushing for years. Also ignoring the debt they have to large coffee chains for opening up the coffee market in this country and actually creating (how ever lame it might be...) SOME kind of coffee culture. No Starbucks? Hell, this place would never have opened. Oh, and the place is pretty damn pricey too. But with endless lines of people rolling up to this crap hole, banging on endlessly about how great it is, there will never be a change. They will keep making a substandard product, keep being rude, keep being dirty....they have suckers giving them money, so they have no need to change. Until people go out and get a little focus, this garbage will keep going on.OH! I thought of a small plus point...they are open a little more often than other cafes in the area....and that's about it. Oh, and one more...the cakes, cookies and quiches are OK (I'm guessing they're made elsewhere, but I don't know)....but damn do the staff resent you if you order food.

I ordered a cappuccino and it was okay-a little bitter.Second time around, I ordered a mocha and it was slightly on the bitter side too. I think the shots aren't being poured quickly enough into the milk. The barista also asked me if I'd like whipped cream and though I asked for no whip, I opened my cup to see whipped cream.

Those rich chocolate squares of heaven may be directly responsible for my gaining a few pounds of late.The breakfast sandwiches are simple but delicious. One of the most affordable menu items. They always have fantastic quiche as well, which is also baked onsite. They don't serve Intelligentsia any more, which is totally fine because they serve Counter Culture instead, which is incredibly delicious and more socially conscious. For drip coffee (my go-to) they have the Number 46 house blend as well as the Decaf Rustico Espresso blend available every day. They typically have a third carafe of rotating regional or organic blend available as well.Baristas are always super friendly and they recognize the regulars. The owners are community activists and church leaders and the shop is definitely a hotbed for community meetings and non-profit workers coordinating events and the like.

I live a block away. I also like that it starts at 7:30. Not everyone is a late-night owl and it's good to be able to sing fairly early, stay a few hours, and be home in time for a reasonable bedtime.Sue is a great KJ, as I said in my Parlour review. She works hard, using very good karaoke technology and her nice sound \u00a0system, to make everyone sounds as good as possible. She's conscientious and takes her job seriously. She is personable and friendly to everyone, not just her favorites -- which I've noticed can be a problem with some other KJs. She is encouraging to the singers and makes people feel at home and just have fun.She has a large songbook with a very diverse selection, and her computer has many additional choices not in the book. If you don't see it in the book, ask her to check her laptop.The sound system Sue has invested in is outstanding.

I just wanted a beer and a sandwich, but that was apparently too much to ask. The bartender never acknowledged my presence. I was finally able to flag him down, at which point he silently dropped a menu in front of me and then walked away to ignore me again. Everyone else was apparently a regular and was greeted and promptly served and enjoyed some friendly banter, while I sat wondering what was wrong with me. I guess I don't count because I'm not recognized as a regular. I finally got up and left without ever being served. Thanks for nothing.Then, there was the time I was with a small group. We all placed our orders. Drinks came quickly, but several of them were wrong, and somehow my drink was forgotten. Our food took forever, and again several people were served the wrong dishes and my food was forgotten. Our waitress tried to argue with us when we pointed out the mistakes, insisting that everything was right and if we had changed our minds about what we wanted then we should have said something before she brought the food out. Even though I asked about my missing order twice, it never came, so I ended up eating fries off of one of my friend's plates. Even though I never got my food, my order was included on our bill, which led to more argument with our waitress, who insisted that she had served me my missing meal. My most recent visit was no exception. Some friends and I arrived, sat, perused the menu, and ordered. I had limited time to hang out and eat, so I only ordered an appetizer, thinking it wouldn't take as long as an actual entree. Once we order, we waited. Then we waited some more. And waited. Finally, our drinks arrived. But where was our food? So we waited again. And waited some more. We watched the tables around us being served. We continued to wait. Finally, one of our group flagged down our waitress to ask about our orders. Apparently, she had never actually put them in. There was no apology of any kind. Finally, our food arrived over an hour after we had ordered. Sadly, it arrived just as I was leaving, so I never actually got to eat anything.

Your food is good. Your drinks are good. Your general atmosphere is good. Your service, however, has never been that good and has recently been terrible. My last three visits to your establishment have been truly awful. Sorry, but three strikes is all you get.First, there was the time that I was dining alone and decided to go ahead and sit at the bar, where I was treated to the joy of being completely ignored. I just wanted a beer and a sandwich, but that was apparently too much to ask. The bartender never acknowledged my presence. I was finally able to flag him down, at which point he silently dropped a menu in front of me and then walked away to ignore me again. Everyone else was apparently a regular and was greeted and promptly served and enjoyed some friendly banter, while I sat wondering what was wrong with me. I guess I don't count because I'm not recognized as a regular. I finally got up and left without ever being served. Thanks for nothing.Then, there was the time I was with a small group. We all placed our orders. Drinks came quickly, but several of them were wrong, and somehow my drink was forgotten. Our food took forever, and again several people were served the wrong dishes and my food was forgotten. Our waitress tried to argue with us when we pointed out the mistakes, insisting that everything was right and if we had changed our minds about what we wanted then we should have said something before she brought the food out. Even though I asked about my missing order twice, it never came, so I ended up eating fries off of one of my friend's plates. Even though I never got my food, my order was included on our bill, which led to more argument with our waitress, who insisted that she had served me my missing meal. My most recent visit was no exception. Some friends and I arrived, sat, perused the menu, and ordered. I had limited time to hang out and eat, so I only ordered an appetizer, thinking it wouldn't take as long as an actual entree. Once we order, we waited. Then we waited some more. And waited. Finally, our drinks arrived. But where was our food? So we waited again. And waited some more. We watched the tables around us being served. We continued to wait. Finally, one of our group flagged down our waitress to ask about our orders. Apparently, she had never actually put them in. There was no apology of any kind. Finally, our food arrived over an hour after we had ordered. Sadly, it arrived just as I was leaving, so I never actually got to eat anything. I have friends who love R Public House and insist that it is awesome in every way, but I have never experienced that myself. Is there something wrong with me? Am I such a terrible person that they can't bring themselves to serve me?

Our favorite item is the cream cheese balls which are supposed to be filled with bacon and chives. \u00a0The first time we had that we were absolutely amazed how delicious it was. But each time since then there has been basically only cream cheese in them which does not make them taste good. These cream cheese balls are actually the one reason that we want to go to this place as well as the wings which are very good.Now I don't even really want to go anymore because it's been pretty inconsistent. \u00a0the cream cheese balls are not at all how they are described on the menu because there's only cream cheese. Also the first time we went we got these amazing bloody Marys and we've ordered them again twice since and they just haven't been as good and also they're missing many of the items that were there the first time. Really, these inconsistencies are what really frustrates me about R public house because I want to love it so much and it's right across the street from my house. But I really don't want to give them the business if they're not gonna give me the product that I want. I will say this, we went last night for some cream cheese only balls and wings and we had told them we were on our way to a concert so we were pressed for time and they jumped on it and immediately got us a menu , our drinks and our food so that was great. Unfortunately I would have given them two stars if that hadn't happened last night so then stepping it up last night really helped this review. Also I must say that I had the brunch burger the first time and it was amazing. So amazing that I told my coworkers the following week.

I don't care anymore since this location has permanently lost me as a customer.Their meat department is really lacking in quality. Prices often ring up for the wrong price here. During their store opening they had promotions that were incorrect in their register for over 2 months, despite them knowing about it the second day they opened.I've also had cashiers not be able to identify the produce/fruit I was purchasing, and have rang up things that were on sale as a different type of fruit/produce \u00a0that wasn't on sale, etc. \u00a0Speaking of produce...

I went in for some cartilage piercings and had called prior to see how many could be done in one sitting because I wanted several. I was told they could do however many I wanted. Which, at the time I was like \"cool\". Went in, the guy was super nice, I got 3 piercings in one ear instead of the 5 I wanted because all they had left was 3 earrings. This was fine because my tolerance was pretty much up with the 3. It was a really easy/ mostly painless process and very affordable. I left happy, and I was happy... For a few days. I wasn't given any sort of cleaning solution or anything. He told me to keep it clean, and I did. I googled what to do and everything. Naturally, my ear was swelling, and I was having a hard time keeping the swelling down.  \u00a0 I can admit, this is where I should have taken the piercings out or went back to the shop. Of course I was desperate to keep them in and thought the swelling would go down, I've never had any problems before. But what happened next...  \u00a0 Basically, my ear swallowed 2 of the piercings. Quickly. It went from swollen and touchy to having the entire front part of the earrings engulfed and healed over inside my ear in less than 24 hours. Seriously.  \u00a0 Like I said, I messed up for not acting on it immediately. But now I had to deal with the consequences.  \u00a0 I had to leave town and while I was gone I went to another piercing place to ask for advice/ see if they could do anything before I made a doctors appointment. She told me that the problem was that the bar on the earrings was WAY too short ( no room for any swelling) and the gauge was also too large for that type of piercing. She also said that in the professional world it is known that only 1 cartilage piercing should be done at a time because they do swell. So, glad I *only* got 3... Anyway, she proceeded to cut the back off one with wire cutters and use a tool to cut the front of my ear to try and push the earring through. F%#* this hurt so badly, and I'm not the type to wince and freak out at all, but this had me in fetal position and I tapped out before we could get the earring out. It was bloody and awful, she told me before hand it was going to \"feel horrible\" but I guess I underestimated that. She changed the earring on the 3rd piercing that wasn't terribly f'ed up (only because it was lower and on softer tissue did it survive) and encouraged me to make a doctors appointment.  \u00a0Went to the doctor the next day, they had to use 4 syringes to numb me and it took 20 minutes for them to cut and forcibly (seriously) PULL the earrings out. The doctor had never seen anything like it. The nurse was queasy. This actually wasn't horrible, especially in comparison to what I'd been through already, but I'm terrified to get the bill for it. All in all, the earrings were too short and it caused some serious problems. They shouldn't have used those for my ear. I accept accountability for not acting sooner though. But...

I ordered a burger and fries with a coke and a water. When the delivery guy came, I took my food up to the apartment and realized I had no drinks. I called back, hoping that maybe the delivery guy had the drinks in his car and could bust a U-way. But the guy on the phone admitted he was at fault and forgot to include the drinks. Ok, no biggie, I asked him to bring them and he said it would take another 45 min to an hour. I'm like \"ok well I'm not going to wait that long, so he said he would comp my ENTIRE meal. He didn't have to suggest that I would've been cool with just taking off the drinks from my bill. But I was cool with that as I'm a pretty regular customer here. The drinks were never taken off my bill. So, the next time I go, they can expect me to get a coke and water for free.

I bought a groupon for a keratin treatment at Zoey's and decided to give it a shot because it was such a good deal. Probably should have done some research first on the place, but decided to just go for it. I walked in, and I was not even acknowledged, even though there was a stylist doing someone's hair. I stood there for about a minute until another stylist (I think Zoey) came out and just told me to get in the chair. There wasn't any chit chat, no hi how are you, I just told her I had an appointment and she directed me. It was weird. Usually stylists are chatty and friendly but she wasn't at all. She then proceeded to start my treatment, and what I found her doing was applying the keratin incorrectly. What they're supposed to do is section off your hair and apply keratin to 1-2 inch section and comb it through about 5 times to ensure that it takes. This process usually takes about 25 minutes. What Zoey did, was slather the keratin throughout my hair in a very quick way. She skipped the step where you're supposed to comb it through each section meticulously. And I assure you, my hair needs this step due to its naturally extreme curl. I was curious to see how her incorrect method would take to my hair. Well sure enough, after the keratin sat and she blow dryed and straightened my hair, it was extremely straight. I was almost shocked because I didn't think her method would work. But then I was curious what would happen once I washed my hair 72 hours later. Well, what I assumed would happen, happened. My hair was pretty much in the same state it was before I got the treatment. It didn't relax my curly roots much at all because the product had been applied incorrectly. When I had left the salon, Zoey told me that every time I come in for a treatment it would be for the groupon price I had paid. I thought this was an amazing deal, however I will not be using it.

They might change the name recently, but the name of the salon is totally different one outside - salon Alma. 2. I purchased $99 deal for one keratin treatment at Groupon. My hair is exactly 3cm longer than my shoulder, and the female hairdresser here said since my hair is \"too long\", so I need to pay another $45 to get the full service. While making the reservation over the phone, I told her that my hair is medium-length and she said NOTHING but it would be enough for one regular dose of keratin treatment. She changed her words and justified it with lots of ridiculous reasons in a very disrespectful manner. - such as I am so proud of my job, so I need to be paid more. All the time, she was rolling her eyes and scolding at me with a loud voice. Very disrespectful. 3. She seems to be too proud of her hair certification - she emphasizes that she paid a lots of money for obtaining the beauty license, so she needs to be paid an additional payment to fulfill the service. She said since the price of $99 is not enough to make her beneficial or being proud of her job, so she needs to force extra charge on the customer. Why don't you put a higher price on the groupon deal from the first place, so you don't have to provide your customer ridiculously poor service in a tacky manner? 4. So unfriendly and impolite. I told her nicely \"please take a great care of my hair\", with introducing myself, and she was like \"You are just getting the keratin treatment. I am just doing my own work. I don't care your hair turns out perfect or not.\" What the..? She said it is my freedom that whether I upload a yelp review or call the Groupon. The worst customer service I would ever gotten in Chicago area. I was not provided with water or any customer service, the minimum service I could expect from a hair salon. 5. The result of her work was so poor. After paying $150 bucks for my hair, I am totally dissatisfied with her result. My hair doesn't get straighten enough, I cannot feel any shine or improved smoothness. She never asked me whether I am satisfied with her styling or any of my concerns on my hair. Hope my review helps. My 2 hour travel to the salon was NOT totally worth it. I will definitely pay more and go to another closer salon with nice services and great skills, rather than getting hair done here at Zoey's.

She pours it into the glass like a total amateur, straight down. Of course it's about half foam and she looks as disappointed and confused as me. Okay... I ask for Hacker Weiss and she looks confused. I point to it in the menu. She nods and sets off. She comes back with a beer that is the wrong color and about 3\" of foam. She acknowledges the foam and does nothing about it. At this point I'll take whatever is in front of me so I go to town. It is actually Smithwicks and it tastes watery.In the meantime my boyfriend's gin martini shows up in a tumbler on the rocks with a lemon. What? He asks for olives and our clueless bartender takes 2 olives and sticks them on the ends of straws and hands one to each of us. Like a lollipop. Then the \"martini\" actually tastes like straight up gin. We didn't bring anything up with our bartender because a) she didn't have a strong grasp on the English language and b) she made no apologies for our drinks and I didn't have faith that she would understand our criticisms or offer to comp.

They have a great location, a half a block off the red line, and about the same to my doorstep. \u00a0The atmosphere was modern, with a decent, albeit pretentious vibe for Rogers Park. And every day walking home i see daily specials, but the upsides end there.My wife and I walk in to a mostly empty bar, and waited only a few minutes for the waitress/bartender/cook to come around and take our drink order. \u00a0Yes, one person. \u00a0On a Saturday night. Granted it was only 7:30, but still. \u00a0Now I saw plenty of other people behind the bar-- At least four of what I thought were customers casually strolled behind the bar on into the \"kitchen\" (corner). But none of them were interested in helping out.It took several attempts at eye contact with the one employee before I could convince her that my wife and I would also like some food to go with our overpriced beer (and I know it's far from an Irish pub, but it irks me when people can't pronounce Smithwicks... but I digress). \u00a0Apparently the menus in front of us on the table did not send the message that we were hungry.We each ordered a pizza; she got the margherita, I got prosciutto and mushroom. \u00a0Being so near the kitchen (corner), we watched as she (the bartender/waitress/cook) stretched the dough and applied the cheese, only to pause, walk around the half-wall to our table, and ask if it was alright that there was no basil. \u00a0They were already pretending tomato sauce counted as tomatoes on a margherita pizza, and now, no basil. \u00a0So its a cheese and olive oil pizza. \u00a0Fine.A few minutes after throwing my wife's pizza in the toaster oven, it arrived at our table, a miserable pool of grease and olive oil. \u00a0Since we could see the kitchen, I knew that she had not even started to prepare my pizza, so I went ahead and snagged a slice of hers while I waited. \u00a0The crust was so very thin, and lets not forget, cooked in a toaster, that it was impossible to pick up without everything sliding off the razor thin sheet of half cooked dough. \u00a0Even attempting the fold maneuver only tore the dough to pieces until you just had a sloppy handful of greasy cheese. Call it uber-thin-crust, fine, but if that's how its gonna come, at least give me some silverware.Finally, 15 minutes after my wife's pizza, my pizza arrived. \u00a0My prosciutto and mushroom pizza. \u00a0I was horrified to find that what they referred to as prosciutto was literally cold, thin sliced deli ham, thrown on top of my pizza. \u00a0Now maybe I have high standards, and maybe most people don't know that prosciutto and ham are completely different preparations of meat, and that prosciutto doesn't come in a square block. But COLD? It seemed as though she had forgotten what was supposed to be on the pizza, and at the last minute, remembered and tossed a handful of lunchables over my greasy plate of cheese.So to summarize:1: Understaffed2: Poor service, probably because theyre understaffed3: Way too many random people wandering behind the bar 4: Overpriced drinks5: Terrible food6: TERRIBLE AWFUL FOODI would give this place a zero if I could. \u00a0Never going back.", "rating": "1", "date": [2011, 9, 10]}, "24": {"description": "This is easily the worst bar in the world.

Before last night. And I think I've gleaned some insight into why it's always empty. My experience wasn't bad. Just, well, weird.My husband and I ran into an old friend at the Cubs game Sunday evening and wanted a place to talk, have a drink and maybe share some munchables. Since we live in Rogers Park and she was staying in Evanston, we were looking for a place that would not look askance at three middle aged Cubs fans in full Cubs regalia. Do you know how hard it is to find a nice casual place open in RP on Sunday night? We didn't. First we tried the Peckish Pig. Closed. The bar next door to it? No food. I had an inspiration: the 626 next door to the Glenwood on Morse. Even though the sign on the door said it was open Sundays until midnight, it was closed. But Chuckie's was right next door. It was quiet and open. Eureka!There were folks on the sidewalk cafe, many talking loudly on cell phones. We went inside, completely empty and completely quiet except for two young women talking animatedly at a table. We nosed around and eventually one of the young women came over to us. She was a waiter! The other woman scurried to the sound system and turned on obnoxiously loud music. We were there to talk. And one of us is kind of hard of hearing. Did we need music? OK. She turned it down halfway. Why didn't she just turn it off? I have no clue.My friends ordered beers. I was in the mood for the frozen margarita I have always seen featured on the window sign. And was there food? Oh yes. There was pizza. We also ordered a Pizza Margharita. There were only 3 of us in the whole place, but for some reason our waiter took forever t get us draft beer and my frozen mango margarita? Large chunks of ice in syrupy-sweet warm margarita-flavored foam. Yuck!The pizza margharita was the weirdest, though. Isn't pizza margharita basil and tomatoes? That's what I thought it was, anyway. The pizza took forever, but OK it's pizza. It was thin crust, heavy on the mozzarella cheese with Greek olives and mushrooms. Huh? Not what I was expecting. But the weirdest part is that the waiter brought with her two different kinds of barbecue sauce. Barbecue sauce! Two different kinds. And then scurried away. I got up and found a shaker of Kraft Parmesan cheese and a jar of pepper flakes at the bar and brought it back to the table. No oregano or any other condiments. The pizza was pretty good, actually. Crispy thin crust and lots of gooey cheese. And the olives and mushrooms were perfectly fine, just not what we expected when we ordered. The whole time we were there, we were the only people in the restaurant. The two young women waiters were not at all attentive to us and seemed to be gossiping merrily with each other the whole night in some Eastern European language. There was nothing particularly wrong with our food or our beers. The frozen mango margarita was a huge disappointment and the lack of attentive service was a big non-starter. Not to mention Greek olive and mushroom pizza instead of the Pizza Margharita and the barbecue sauce accompaniment.

It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive, which was a slightly long wait when there were so few others to serve.The vegetable samosa was good, chicken vindaloo and paratha were alright, but the buttered chicken wasn't really to my taste, nor was it anything special. Personal preference: I would've preferred naan instead of paratha, although the latter is slightly healthier as it's made of whole wheat flour as opposed to white flour. Naan is also more chewy in texture. The only thing I really enjoyed was the mango kulfi we ordered last minute for dessert even though we were already full. I'm a huge fan of kulfi, and another Indian dessert - gulab jamun. I would die for these things. The only complaint I have about it is that the kulfi was too sweet. Cut down on the sugar and I'll be coming back again and again for more, and this time ordering the gulab jamun to go along with it as well.

But I finally gave in yesterday and don't regret doing so. Having said that, I can't really address the main themes of the critical reviews--this place's delivery and their Chinese food. For all I know, you order General Tso's chicken at 3pm, it arrives at 10:30pm and resembles Kublai Khan's...something...of his you don't want anywhere near you, much less with a packet of soy sauce.Which is why my common sense kicked in when I was hungry enough to devour a Khan kebob, and I walked to the restaurant and ordered what I sensed they made best. My initial impression was that everyone who worked there was so incredibly personable. One of the cooks even greeted me while never looking up from an intense wok shake session, as if his life depended upon the perfect saute. And then Ms. Jenny appeared out of nowhere. Literally, it was Bewitching. My food could've been 100% breakfast-for-squirrels quality (what? They like pho!), but she literally would bring me back just for her personality.But since I finally got to reviewing the food...I ordered each variety of their summer rolls and too much pho. My name is Jennifer, and I'm a pho ho. The rolls were alright--enough protein to balance the veggies, the peanut sauce was more smokey than spicy with just enough sweetness. Nothing remarkable, nothing critter-brunch level. Didn't get around to eating the pho until today--which allowed me to examine it in all of its gelatinous glory (which was a reassuring plus in itself--doubting the broth was canned). Was actually able to skim about a millimeter (give or take some layers) of solidified fat from the top of the broth. There could have been more protein (I had the meatball and beef) and fewer noodles, but everything combined was quite flavorful, light but filling, and a great dinner.Was my food as nuanced and \"authentic\" as some I've had down by Argyle? No...but am I really comparing a hole-in-the-wall place in Rogers Park to Little Vietnam? Pho no!But when I want to stay local and still enjoy one of my fave cuisines, will this place suffice?Yes, more than enough. It doesn't have an impressive facade, it attracts all walks of life from this neighborhood, and don't even bother trying to eat your meal there unless you like cramped quarters. But go anyway. And ask for Jenny.[And if you're a heat fiend? Ask for your food so spicy it makes you want to go medieval Kublai on someone.

Recently, new owners have moved in under the name Far East Kitchen. The food is better but the service wholly and completely unacceptable. I was treated with utter disdain and pure disrespect. Under no circumstances will I ever spend another penny in this place.Here's the story:I'd tried this place a few times before and I was glad that the quality of the food was much better than the previous occupants. I came in on a Saturday night at around 7pm. Once I entered, I witnessed the two gentlemen behind the counter screaming at each other. Full volume screaming. The louder of the 2 men left. Once he left, I placed my order and paid for it. I ordered a large chicken egg foo young. They aren't the fastest at getting food out but I was okay with that. I decided to go get some things at 7-Eleven and come back. When I got back, I was sure my order would be ready, as I was gone longer than I intended to be. I placed my order at 7:10 according to the time stamp on my receipt. I returned at 7:40. I had been gone a full 30 minutes. The guy who took my order tells me \"I'm making your order now.\" He then goes in the fridge and put the ingredients for my food in the pan. So...he STARTED my order a half hour after I ordered it.I said nothing because I was curious as to how this guy would handle this situation. As he made my order, he did not say anything else to me. It took him 15 minutes to make the food. He bagged my order and handed it to me at 7:55. After giving me my order, he simply turned away to go back to what he was doing. I decided to give him another out. I said, \"I just know that there's an extra egg roll in here or something.\" Did not raise my voice or have any malice in my tone. The guy tells me, \"You get an egg roll when you spend 15 dollars. You order wasn't that much.\" To summarize, it took 45 MINUTES to make an order of egg foo young.I left. I knew I had to leave at that moment because I would have gone off on the guy and I didn't want to give him any excuse for fucking up so badly.I decided to go in the next day they were open (Monday) and give the guy a chance to explain himself or make it right. I used to work in restaurants. Shit happens. So I'm not the type to jump all over people when they mess up. Making a scene or throwing a tantrum isn't my style anyway. And I won't make this a cultural or racial issue because I've been eating Chinese and other Asian food all my life and most of my experiences are positive. The food is good and the people are nice.I went in and in a hushed tone so not to influence the other customers, I recount the situation to the guy. He gets offended. He says, \"So what do you want?\"I say, \"You took almost an hour to complete an order and you have no explanation?\" Still being calm with this guy. He gets even more irritated and says \"you want me to say 'sorry'? you want something else?\"I tell him \"I shouldn't have to prompt you to apologize for unacceptable service, but the least you can do is apologize. Or if you're having a busy night, you can ask if the customers if they mind waiting a little longer. You shouldn't start an order 30 minutes after it has been placed.\"He say \"Sorry.\" flippantly but then immediately follows that with \"it don't hurt me any\"I asked him what he meant. He says it again \"it don't hurt me any. you want me to say sorry, I said sorry\"I said, \"That's fine. I won't come here anymore.\" He says \"Okay, don't come here.\"I was able to keep my cool because I kind of expected this reaction from him(see my review about China Spring on Clark and Lunt). I was just hoping that he would prove me wrong and be decent about the situation.So there it is. Far East Kitchen doesn't give a fuck about you as a customer, they just want your money. If that's how much they value their customers, I can only imagine what level of care they put into making their food.BTW, this guy was taking money and making food at the same time.

Only other con is the guest I was with ordered salad, and they said they were out. How could a restaurant this healthy be out of salad?

I've tried several cocktails and there were only a few that were really solid and it is heavily dependent on the bartender making the cocktail. The negroni and the blueberry pisco sour were very strong drinks - balanced, sweet but strong. But most of the other cocktails in the menu were not as balanced. Some ingredient - the sourness or bitterness usually - were always overpowering the drink. I would recommend Ward Eight as an alternative to RP Social. It is near enough and I've never had a bad experience there.I do like that RP social allows you to bring your own food though.

Try something new, you won't regret it.Service:The bartenders are all lovely. Very amicable....when you can get their attention. They're busy people though, I get it! I just wish the drinks came out a tiny bit faster. When they do come out, they're always well done, though. So I can't complain that much.Ambiance:It's retro-mod. I'm sure there's a real word to describe that look out in interior-designer-land, but I am unaware of it. In short: I like it. They have vintage furnishings, fun old board games and (my personal favorite) they allow dogs to come hang in the bar. DISCLAIMER: if you have a noisy dog, or a nervous dog, this is NOT the place for you to bring them. It's very mellow.

I walk by this one every time I jump on the Red Line to get downtown. But not today. I decided to stop in and get a burger to go, largely because I needed a little TLC - and also because I hadn't eaten there before.The place was not busy. Only a couple of people at a few tables and no one in line ahead of me. It took a while to process the simple order of a mini cheeseburger and fries. But this is a good thing, when it comes to fast food. So no complaints here. If you want custom-made fast food, it ain't gonna be that fast. For that, go down the street to Mickey D's - if you please. But you'll be missing a great dining experience if you do.The price was more than I should be paying these days for such fare, but as I said, I needed a little TLC, so I was treating myself. Had time to visit the bathroom, which was messy. I just don't understand why people don't bother to flush. But that's not Five Guys' fault. When I got my food, the bag had so much grease on it, I was grateful to have an extra large baggie on hand to put around it. I threw it in my bag and went on to my next destination - the El across the street. Greeted by a few policeman who barred the doors, it was clear I would not be taking the Red Line at this moment. Apparently, there was a \"problem\" at the Wilson stop. Something told me it wasn't a mechanical problem, either -- given what I've come to learn about that stop.I quickly had to decide, as I watched a 147 whiz by, whether I would wait for another one to get downtown. Or I could catch the 155 that was coming and just go back home. Not remembering what the stop would be for my destination off the 147, I found myself focusing instead, on the wonderful smelling burger and fries that were just beckoning me. So I jumped on the 155 - greeted by the same bus driver who had just dropped me off 15 minutes before in the other direction. I know this, because he said \"Back again?\" Whereupon I told him that the Red Line was not running due to some kind of hostage situation at the Wilson stop. I also decided it wasn't worth it to wait for another 147 going downtown. Besides, I'd have to think about which stop to get off at. I was happy that my burger and fries were still warm through all of this chaos. My first action, after tearing into my burger and fries - was to fire up the 'ol laptop to do a review, before I forget. Overall, I am very pleased with this burger and fries. The mini is more than enough for one person to eat. And the fries runneth over, such that I will put the remainder in the freezer for a snack at another time. This burger reminds me of Fatburger in L.A. -- they were known for some of the most juicy and freshly made burgers in town, garnering awards, much like this joint.I probably won't be back again for some time, until budget permits. Paying nearly $7 for a miniburger and fries is pricey for my budget. This holiday season has brought a few more challenges than I was expecting. But isn't that always the way? Less than good financial news is often brought at the end of the year, just in time to spoil people's plans and lives. So thank God Five Guys Burger and Fries is around as comfort food. Expensive -- but well worth it. In fact, I'd skip a few meals for one like this. So that's my story, in the Windy City, this Monday, December 5th \u00a0- pitch black outside - at only 6pm. Well fed and ready for bed. But too early for that. Besides, I have work to catch up on. You know, for that client who doesn't really deserve it.

They're a perfectly serviceable vehicle for ketchup, but that's not what great fries are in my book. Without ketchup, they're fairly tasteless and lack that delicate texture.

When they were finally ready to give me my mani, my manicurist had a laptop set up at her station and was watching TV AND instant messaging while attending to me!!! I couldn't believe it. I was further shocked when her phone rang and she answered it. She wasn't at all interested in doing a good job, and I had to show her flaws several times. The nails she gave me are thick and ugly, and will look horrible in a week when they grow out. While drying them, she burned my thumb and it really really hurt because the acrylic got over-heated. The polish had bubbles in it, so I asked her to redo it...and she used acetone remover. Um...shouldn't she know that acetone will melt the surface of my nail??? So now one of my thumbs has a rough texture to it. At that point, I didn't even bother telling her what to do, I just wanted to get out of there.

Actually, they used it for my pedicure, too, which was really odd. Rosa is very aggressive and tedious with the cuticle trimming and drew blood on both my big toes.

I was there at 12:30. No one ever came and another customer drove up, came to the door and left within minutes.

The result was a splendid jewel in a neighborhood should rise to the occasion. The concept of restaurant/bar in the front and performance space in the back works extremely well as independent siblings.The shortfall comes with the technical appointments in the performance space. First, this was built to accommodate fairly simple stage bookings like comics and musicians. In other words it's not a theatre for shows requiring specific needs - like sets and lights. In fact, there is very little backstage space and even less off-stage changing room for such occasions.From an audience point of view, there is a genuine lack of feature (white) lighting to cover the stage. There are some beautiful accents (colors), but if a performer takes a few steps sideways or moves to the front of the stage, the fixed rigging of white light just doesn't allow the performer to be lit. Ouch! This is a HUGE point when the audience simply can't see the main attraction. This can be fixed, but it hasn't seemed to be a priority. If you can't adjust your hanging lights to cover the front of the stage, then the real fix is to add a moving spot - and an operator.Most importantly, the sound system seems ample and perched properly to do it's job - but it doesn't. For a music venue, I have found that a singing performer just can't be heard above the instrumental in various areas of the house, upstairs or down. This could be the operator and the mix of the sound from the board. Whatever it is, the sound person needs to take of the headphones (that's right) and actually listen the the sound in the house. My multiple visits have left me so frustrated with the sound (and lights) that I feel embarrassed that this stunning neighborhood space is in the wrong hands.The Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier has a similar arrangement. Perhaps they can let a technical hand to how to make things work properly.Mayne Stage has so much going for it but what it lacks is crucial. Even the seating arrangement doesn't seem very comfortable and efficient overall and as a \"VIP\" I've had to jockey for a \"guaranteed\" seat. That's not right. Please get your stuff together.

Every 30 seconds sheinterrupted the show to ask how we were doing. By standing right infront of our view. She asked if our check was ready by standing rightin front of our view during the very end of Michelle L'amour's act. Itwasn't, and we tried to tell her that, but she grabbed the cash andran.When we finally flagged her down after the performance to see if therewas change for us, she then started being huffy, saying she couldn'tfigure out which money was ours, and that maybe we didn't pay herenough. She was right, as we tried to tell her during the performancethat she kept interrupting!

Heard that the owners put in 6 million to this joint and it shows. The lighting and seating areas areas were really polished and new. The bar area was a bit undersized; had there been a crowd it would have been a fireharzard in there. Had a great time sitting up close to the bandstage and really feeling the music.Now onto the bad. The only weakness of the place is the service and pricing of drinks. The food was really good; a tad overpriced given the area and the fare at other places. I have had stuff that tops this place, and they should respect that. Well, you readers will have the option of listening to me, or not. But that's the honest truth. What really pissed me off was that I had to pay 6 dollars for a pint. Of beer. One. To add insult to injury, my friend, who doesn't drink had to almost pay double the amount for soda water and fruit juice just for ordering her drink in the theater instead of at the bar. \"I would have walked to the bar, it's dead in here!\" was her response. I couldn't blame her. And neither would you if you weren't told of the drink price discrepancy from the get go. \"You could speak to the manager,\" was our kind, dainty waitress' response.

You load directly in to back stage. The stage is huge, way bigger than any place else I've played. Lots of room. And lots of staff. I can't imagine what the budget is like to run this place. Stage managers, assistants, the works. You'll find plenty of help here. Parking is on street and it's a crowded neighborhood so you may have to search for a bit after load in.The room is huge, the sound booms. For a cost they'll record your gig and give you a digital copy. We did and it sounded good, dropped it right into protools and started mixing a live release.Bands get half-off a meal at the restaurant/bar in the front of the place. It's a good deal with good food so take advantage of that. I'd go back just for dinner.They have a box office to sell tickets. They have someone to take your ticket. Fans walk into the lobby and are greeted with a full bar. Two staircases frame the opposite side, leading up to the balcony. It's clean and carpeted.

We could not have had our wedding without her. (PS - I planned my own wedding, but Kat helped so much!)Venue - just perfect.

It was a dream come true for anyone trust me. The venue is PERFECT!Food - I was really nervous about having a buffet dinner. The tasting proved to be excellent and Kat was willing to work with us on modifications to the menu. It was so easy and they were so accommodating. They even created special plates for our vegetarian friends. What? Who does that? Mayne Stage does! Kat does! So the big question - was the food as good on the day of as it was in the tasting? YES! It was amazing. The food may seem a little more 'pub' style for some, but we had Panko Crusted Lemon Chicken (YUM!!!!), Salad portion Salmon (Amazing), grilled veggies (people could not stop talking about them) and pasta/salad, etc. My Mom, a very picky eater, is still talking about the food as are many of the guests.

Mayne Stayge boasts by far the best high end sound capability of any Rogers Park venue and that of many larger and better known theatres we've experienced. We have seen and heard Rachel Barton-Pine \u00a0play never before performed violin works; live chamber music; many performances simulcast via WFMT or WXRT and hosted by their announcers; a live performance of newly created dual guitar music for an old black and white Hitchcock silent film while watching that film on their big screen; rock; smooth jazz; International World music; and much more; pretty much everything but rap. Tomorrow we will again enjoy the Superbowl on their 22 foot screen with that phenomenal sound almost making us believe we are in the stadium, though without the annoyances of actually being outdoors in January. The only rather awful sound experience was a Leon Russell show a couple years ago, and frankly I mostly blame his crew as every other musical performance has been so exceptionally calibrated. Seriously, the ratio is something like 500 very good and excellent to one truly distorted, overly loud and sadly unenjoyable live show.Table service provides the full range of soft drinks, alcoholic refreshments and pub grub from a limited menu out of the Act One, which is part of this Pritzker family owned property.

Still, I should mention that it's a great spot for dinner, concerts, or just drinks. Good food, relaxed atmosphere, and they're always playing music, whether it's live or just someone's iPod hooked up at the bar. MS was the first of a few venues we looked at. The space felt perfect for my wife and I; not too stuffy, just nice. And customizable too. Having a bunch of different seating, staging, and bar access options made us comfortable that the place would never feel too big or too small regardless of how many guests were able to attend. For the record, we ended up with about 100 and they filled the space nicely, though with the second floor balcony and two bar areas, 150-200 guests could probably fit comfortably. Oh, and the stage. So good for live music. Or guests had so much fun dancing to the band. Basically, it seemed like we kept hearing the same compliment over and over from our guests throughout the night: \"You guys picked an amazing venue.\"The food was great. I would echo David's review--we were initially nervous about doing a buffet. But people really seemed happy with our slider bar. In fact, my wife's (very non-vegetarian) uncle was mainlining the kale sliders all night, because they were so good he didn't notice the separate cheeseburger tray. Definitely happy with our trio of burgers, pulled pork, and kale sliders, as well as all the sides and passed apps. From the moment we booked the venue, Kat was both helpful and reassuring. I can't tell you how nice it is, during the occasionally fraught wedding planning process, to deal with someone that defuses stress instead if adding to it. Every time we went to Kat with a concern or request, she always found a way to make it work and never let us feel like we were being high maintenance. By the time the wedding rolled around, we were comfortable that we were getting everything we wanted, and under budget at that. The day of the wedding, the entire MS staff was so reliable. Special bonus points to Jacob, who salvaged a ridiculous ceiling decoration we'd brought to the venue in a tangled mess. All in all, the place looked exactly like we wanted it to, the staff really looked after ourselves and our guests, and everybody had a great time. If you're thinking of having your wedding here, please do.

In the back of this building is where you will find their small will call window, another bar, and then a pretty decently sized venue with floor seating with tables of 4 set up, some chairs set up along the edges of the first floor, and then a small second floor of balcony seating, some of which has better views down to the small stage than others. So definitely get here early for a show, since the good seats definitely disappear quite early here it seems! We lucked out and got three chairs on the top level on the corner but were in the first row of chairs there so we got to look directly down onto the performance beneath us which was kind of a cool way to watch a show. Servers will also come to you to take drink orders throughout the show which is really nice since that way you don't have to miss a second of anything you paid money to see. The drinks aren't too pricey (we got three mixed drinks for about $20) and they were pretty strong too.

A day later, my only complaint is that Quesadilla Le Reina Del Sur is all the way on Howard Street, and I would have to get in my car and drive 20 minutes to get there. Were it not for the snow and cold, I might do just that. Yes, the food was that good.I've eaten at this place long ago, when it was Lakeside Caf\u00e9, now long gone, so it was easy to find, just east of the Howard/Sheridan Road intersection. Because snow and sleet were blowing and I am a big weenie about weather the older I get, I took a pay parking spot right in front. Normally, paying for parking is against my principles, but weather makes you do strange things. I can't tell you if free street parking is easy or not.The restaurant doesn't look much different from its Lakeside Caf\u00e9 days - still light and airy and comfortable. We were the only customers, so we were served with chips, two kinds of salsa and a veggie salsa, and waters right away. There is a huge menu of smoothies and juices, but we were on lunch patrol.The salsas were all good. \u00a0The green is the mildest. The red and the veggie mix have a definite kick that is not too intense. Purple Grandma ordered an omelet with mushrooms and rice and beans on the side. What you don't know about my friend is that she is a small woman who really doesn't eat much. When her entr\u00e9e came (in reasonable time, by the way), she stared at it, and I laughed. She said, \"That's enough to feed me for three days.\" She's right. For the average overfed American, it's probably a normal portion.I wanted to sample different things, so I ordered ala carte; the standard tamale, a taco with soyrizo (fake chorizo), and a quesadilla with nopales. I liked all of it. The tamale came first, followed by the taco and quesadilla. (I uploaded a photo.) I didn't use any salsa on any of these; none of them needed enhancement. I finished the taco and took the remains of the tamale and quesadilla home. I was almost uncomfortably full until about 8pm, and then I recovered enough appetite to kill off the leftovers. It wasn't three days worth of meals, but it sure held me.I had a cup of coffee, which was good. In fact, when I first tasted it, I thought, \"this is really good.\" The sugar that came with it was brown sugar on a small plate, and a small creamer. I don't know if the creamer was non-dairy or not, but I suspect that it was.Delicious food, good service, and a broad selection of vegan and vegetarian food. The only thing that happened that was a little strange was an elderly lady wearing a company t-shirt sitting at a back table. She was playing with her phone, which isn't unusual, but then she played some sort of video featuring shouting and explosions, and we got the full benefit of that. It only went on for about a minute, and Purple Grandma and I just looked at each other and laughed.I really liked what I had, and I would go back to try other menu items.", "rating": "5", "date": [2016, 3, 2]}, "5": {"description": "This is a wonderful vegan/vegetarian Mexican place!

We pulled up right in front and were dismayed to find a Cash Only sign on the door. \u00a0Back into the car and to an ATM. \u00a0Back to the restaurant, so excited and hungry...We were greeted by a friendly server and told to sit wherever we wanted. \u00a0We chose a big table and got ready to order. \u00a0I had coached S and GF earlier that they should make sure to order dairy cheese because I knew they wouldn't like the vegan cheese. \u00a0We ordered guacamole and tried to order drinks. The girls were disappointed there was no soda available, but hey, it's a juice bar and they did have horchata. \u00a0I was hoping for some iced tea, but none of that either. \u00a0We got water.We ordered guacamole and once we added salt, it was really good. \u00a0I was also disappointed that the chips seemed to be bagged - one of the best parts of eating Mexican is fresh-made chips. \u00a0The trio of salsas we were served with our chips was almost delicious enough to make up for this.We asked for smoothies and I ordered a huarache (basically an open-face quesadilla) with soy carne asada and dairy cheese. \u00a0I'd had this twice at the Western location and it was perfect - not too greasy, perfect seasoning on the soy meat, lots of cheese, good sope base. \u00a0S and GF both ordered flautas with dairy cheese. \u00a0I also mentioned to the server that I would be ordering some beans and tamales to go - I do that regularly from the other location as I live in the distant suburbs now and I like to bring home Chicago food.We waited for our food.....and waited some more. \u00a0We were the only people in the restaurant, so it didn't make sense that we were waiting so long for smoothies, which we'd wanted to counteract the delicious heat from the salsa. \u00a0We figured maybe they were bringing them out with our main dish - but after twenty minutes, we really didn't see why we didn't have ALL the food. \u00a0Another table of people came in at that point and were followed in by a woman who didn't seem to have all of her marbles and kept asking for money and hot sauce. \u00a0While we had initially spotted only one person working in the restaurant - our server - several more suddenly came out to help oust the marbleless lady and threaten her with police. \u00a0So that was fun.Literally 50 minutes after we entered, we were finally served our smoothies and then our entrees. We were starving at this point and couldn't wait to dig in. \u00a0Then I noticed that my hurarache didn't seem to have any cheese on it. \u00a0Instead it had beans. \u00a0I proceeded to have the following conversation with our server.Me: I'm sorry, I don't see any cheese on this.Her: We don't have any cheese.Me: ....I ordered cheese.Her: Do you want vegan cheese?Me: No. \u00a0Why didn't you tell me when I ordered cheese that you....didn't have any?Her: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \u00a0The lady went out to get some cheese. \u00a0She will be back in five minutes.Me: \u00a0And then you'll put cheese on top of this?Her: Yes, she will be back very soon. Five minutes.Me: \u00a0Why didn't you tell me you were out of cheese when I ordered?Her: I'm sorry. \u00a0My English is not so good. \u00a0Me: It seems pretty good to me. \u00a0We're communicating right now.Her: I will bring the flautas. They are okay without cheese, yes?S and GF: \u00a0Well, no, not really...Me: \u00a0No. We ordered them with cheese because that's what we wanted.Her: \u00a0I'm sorry. \u00a0I'm so sorry. \u00a0You want to wait for the lady?Me: \u00a0No. \u00a0You guys want to go? \u00a0They did and we left. \u00a0She didn't charge us anything, just told us to leave, so we got free salsa, chips, guac, and smoothies. Because of that and how sweet our server was, they're getting the second star.But seriously....1. \u00a0You don't take credit cards, even though a vegetarian restaurant generally appeals to a slightly more upscale crowd accustomed to using them, oh, and it's 2015?2. \u00a0 You ran out of cheese? \u00a0At 1pm on a Sunday? \u00a0You're a MEXICAN RESTAURANT. \u00a0You can't run out of cheese. \u00a0It's not reasonable.3. \u00a0Then we order food with cheese - and specify the kind of cheese we want, and on all three entrees....and you don't tell us you're out of cheese?4. \u00a0THEN, you attempt to serve us our entrees as if we somehow won't notice the lack of cheese, and are surprised when we object?5. \u00a0Also, our food took 50 minutes when we were one of only two tables in the restaurant? \u00a0With no explanation? \u00a0I have never typed the word \"cheese\" so many times in one sitting. \u00a0But seriously.

My experience was so off base from the others that I felt the need to add some dissonance in here. To the owners - please take this feedback to heart, as we would like to see you succeed in the neighborhood. We ordered nachos and a veggie burrito expecting healthy Mexican food, as advertised. After all, $20 usually goes a long way for Mexican in Chicago. The nachos were an oversized pile of bland chips with a thin layer of melted cheese, refried beans, and some fake meat. There were no vegetables present. The chips/topping ratio was extremely imbalanced. The veggie burrito had more of an array of ingredients, and it was quite a large portion. However it was equally as flavorless and disappointing. We specially requested guacamole on both our items, however it was not included. They get a bonus star for not giving us a significant hassle when we asked our order be corrected. The guacamole tasted wholly unseasoned and relied too heavily on some thick slices of red onion. In addition to serving better quality food, I think this restaurant should rewrite the menu to be more descriptive. Our main issue here is how expectations did not add up to reality. \"Healthy\" and \"vegetarian\" implies actual vegetables will be present. Instead all we noticed was what was left out.

The haircuts were ok, \u00a0and these are high rated salons, not a quickcut type place...we talked about how to avoid the \"triangle head\" or when my hair was long it would stretch out the curls, so I felt there was definitely some knowledge of curls there. I just never really felt they understood my curls. I decided to take a chance and try this place out, and I was pleasantly surprised! My stylist was Betty, who was so sweet and talked to me about what she was doing to my hair the entire time. She explained the entire deva-process, which I'd heard of before but not all the details and the reasoning behind it. I love that, it tells me the artist is trained, willing to \"train me\", has a passion for her craft and is thinking about it throughout the entire cut (cut, wash, trim, dry). In the end I got a new head full of beautiful bouncy volume lush curls and a head full of knowledge on how to style and use the best products....PLUS I'd also gotten a single process color to cover this dreaded gray and it was the best color I've had in a long time, and it has lasted much longer then the salon I was going to prior, and my head didn't stink afterwards either.

She gave me a tutorial at the washing station and she taught me how to finger detangle my hair ( I didn't even know that combs were a \"no-no\" when it came to curly hair). She even allowed me to finger detangle one side of my wet hair while she watched so I could know how to do it at home! Also, she gave me loads and loads of advice about how I can maintain my hair so I can keep my curls in tact. Wow! She paid close attention to my needs, wants, desires and lifestyle when she cut, shaped, washed and dried my hair. I am a minimalist, so I needed a curly cut that would allow me to get up, shake and go. Laneeta gave me just that. I am now on my 2nd day hair and my hair looks like I just got it done. I've never had 2nd day hair and I am sure I can stretch my wash-and-go another 5 days. I am absolutely amazed.I am a forever client. Many thanks goes to Laneeta and to the entirety of the Cally's Curls and Company staff.

Conceptualized and planned by the students, the Market's goals are to:Increase access to fresh nutritious locally grown and produced foods to community members in a densely populated urban settingTo contribute to Loyola's mission to serve those in need by providing a community gathering place where fresh, nutritious foods are affordableTo support small growers that apply sustainable agriculture and land conservation practicesTo support small producers with entrepreneurial spiritProvide a place where all can purchase local and seasonal foods to support the \"farm to plate\" lifestyleFarmers' Market Prices Competitive With Grocery Store ChainsAre you interested in purchasing vine-ripened tomatoes directly from the farmer that grew them but worry that they'll stretch your budget just a little too uncomfortably? Think again. Emerging investigations are beginning to challenge the notion that produce purchased from Farmers' Markets is more expensive than their supermarket counterparts. \u00a0Sometimes, consumers can even purchase better quality food for less at their local Farmers' Market.

That being said, I probably would have been better off starting at Starbucks or Peets.First of all, as an employee I was treated very poorly. Sony rules his cafes by fear and anger. He would spy on me in the cameras and then call the cafe to interrogate me on what I was doing (which was either cleaning, making gelato or making people drinks) if he didn't understand through the camera. He would give me instructions that were impossible to follow through on because they were so unrealistic. His main way of talking to his employees is through coated threats, yelling and/or swearing. I had more than a few customers who had spectated the way he treated me and other employees make comments about how he would talk to us. I was never trained on how to use the espresso machine, and to my knowledge, there was no set pattern for drink consistency. I NEVER got paid on time and my checks were either short, weeks late or both. He was conveniently unavailable whenever I needed to talk about payment, but was always checking his camera to interrogate me on why I'm mopping the floors a certain way. He asked me to do ghost writing for him without any sort of payment, and would have me sit down after I had clocked out to write his emails and rewrite paragraphs he had written. The coffee quality at Cafe Descartes when I was there was absolutely awful. I don't think he cared too much about the quality of the beans. It was obvious that he had social motivation rather than artistic appreciate for coffee. Finally, the icing on the cake is how I was \"fired.\" I was hospitalized for a small period of time and couldn't make it to work. I made various efforts during my time as a patient and after to communicate that I was unable to work and would be available after a few weeks and he never replied...

Upon further attention, we can see that there are some window signs and even beer neons. Guessing it's a good fast-food joint with some \"beer\" (Miller, bud, etc). Well that's where the \"meh\" ends.INSIDE:To say that I was surprised upon walking in is an understatement. A wonderfully laid-out and spacious place with no shortage of t.v.s to wall-paper the almost-too-fancy-for-a-steak-sandwich-joint walls. The main eating area on the Sheridan side where there are plenty of table and booth seating but i head straight to the back on the Pratt side. A couch and comfy cushion chairs by a frickin' fireplace. \u00a0The atmosphere alone would bring me back here, assuming I would find something i found tasty (It is a fast-food joint after all, right?). Well... THE FOOD:The classic Philly Steak sandwich is as good as a steak sandwich can get which made it hard to try anything else but since It looks like i'll be coming here 2-4 times / week, I figured I'd try the Philly CHICKEN sandwich. I figured that if it's 75% as good as the steak, I would be happy. It turns out it's the best sandwich that I had ever had in my entire life and that's BEFORE adding any of the blue cheese sauce to it. I had never felt sorry for blue cheese in my life before this moment as blue cheese knows how tasty and loved it is. \u00a0But ... oh my goodness... I actually left off most of the cheese as the sandwich was so delicious and rich on it's own (can't possibly be health food). \u00a08\" Phillys are serves with Philly chips or very tasty fries. Unfortunately, there are too many fries served for my new Under-10,000-calorie/day lifestyle (I cut my teeth eating 2 burritos with 3 basket of chips per sitting back in the day at El Gallo De Oro on 63rd and St. Louis after closing out some bars). The fries are good enough to merit their own bar with a plethora (yep. I typed \"plethora\") of toppings. Speaking of bars...THE BAR:Yep. There's a bar on the way to the fireplace section. I'm on the couch having coffee and a pack of TastyKakes (Usually an east-coast-only item). Turning my head to the right , I can catch the end of the bar and see the bottles from the likes of Two Brothers, Bells, Great lakes, Sam Adams, Half Acre, and others. I do recall also having a fresh Revolution Anit-hero (beer was fresh, lines where clean) which I see is currently on tap along with Founders' breakfast stout, Gooses' Matilda, a couple handles I can't make out from here, and a few old standby's for those that like their beer the 90's way (Bud, Old Style, etc). I've been to proper BAR bars that don't have at least one stout or porter..The lack of outside signage is really a shame. I'm certain if it had more visibility that this place would do more business. All it takes is one visit. I'm tellin' ya. Can't wait to tear through the entire menu.

Is it a lunchtime destination for a the business crowd (there isn't one in Rogers Park)? Is it a sports bar (not much sports)? Is it fast food place (too slow for that)? Is it a regular bar (no bartender)?It is hard tell, and therefore hard to judge. They may be succeeding when measured against their objectives, but I don't know what those are and don't really care. The place is always empty for a reason. When they close they will not be missed.=-=-=-=-=-=If you want more details keep reading. If you think I'm a blow hard; you are probably right, so go read another review.If you work for the restaurant and want to know how fix it; don't bother. Just close and let something interesting move into one of the better locations in the neighborhood.Let's start with the food: 4 starsMy cheese steak was good. Better than Pat's and Gino's in Philly, however (sorry Philly) those sandwiches aren't very good. Perhaps the best cheesesteak in the area, but not the best sandwich in the area; there are several better options to the north and south on Sheridan. Fries = Good. Better fries can be had west of the Red Line on Morse. For $10, they are pushing it. For only a few more dollars, I could be eating at real restaurant a few blocks away.The menu: 3 starsThe menu has a limited selection of \"pre-defined\" options. What is offered is good, but the process created by their menu is a pain in the arse. Instead, you are left with the ability to customize your culinary experience. This would be interesting, but proves to be cumbersome. Unless one is a regular, there is long period of time spent wading through a lengthy list of options prior to attempting to place an order.Options are good when interesting, but here we have a long list trivial variations. Why have 5 cheeses? If you know what makes the best cheesesteak sandwich, then suggest it with that. (perhaps it was 4 or 7, tough to tell because the menu was poorly formatted and tough to read). Then there is the fry bar with 35 optional toppings (priced by weight?). Fry bar? Why? I've never seen anyone bother with the effort. The sandwiches come with fries, so I am certainly not going to order more.The beer menu is not well planned. PBR. Some kind of generic \"light\" american lager (does it really matter which one?), 2 Brothers EPA (kinda light), something else light in flavor and color, and a Porter. Clearly not a menu planned by someone that cares about beer and has a desire to sell much of it.Service: 1 starHave to be careful here. The person that took my order was nice, but seemed to struggle as much as I did with the menu, couldn't really guide me through the process, and didn't have a suggestions. I don't really have any issues with that aspect of the service. It is what it is. All of the fast food restaurants within a mile have staff that are better at taking orders and moving transactions along that the staff here.The single star is for management and their offering. Perhaps more is deserved, as the restaurant roughly achieves it's service goal. The goal however appears to be to minimize staffing. I suspect that this will succeed, because it has a negative impact on service which appears to also minimize business.Place your order at the counter. Stand and wait (for 10 minutes on a slow day), or go find a seat? Not sure. Decided to sit.There is a place with a sign above it suggesting that there is \"Booze here\", however there is no bartender. Order your beer from the crack team at the counter.Atmosphere: -3 stars.A negative number, Is that allowed? Sure. The atmosphere seriously detracted from my experience.1. As mentioned above, there is a place labelled booze here, pretends to be a \"bar\". There is a counter (not a bar, a counter) with some stools in front of it. There is not a person working in this section, so all you are offering is a place with sigh above it.2. The chairs at the tables are non-padded, simple, wooden chairs. Fine for 20 - 30 minutes. I would never think about going there to watch a game.3. The \"sports bar\" does have several TVs. One a day with multiple baseball games, a NASCAR race, College Rugby 7s, golf, and more, we had: Tennis and a documentary on ESPN News that featured graphic pictures of the burns suffered by the subject prior to their road to recovery.The End.You may say, \"It's about f'ing time\".

Then he did not greet me with 'hello,' or 'welcome...,' but instead, his way of asking, 'how may I help you?' was with a blunt: \"What's up?\" I ordered a slice of pizza, which came out of a revolving display case under a heat lamp.The slice had three curled up, dry, pepperonis on it, the crust was hard, it was very greasy, and the cheese was off center when he peeled it away from the pizza, because the cheese had solidified. As I was dining-in, I guess I had expected it to be fresh--it wasn't. I was starving though, so I regretfully took it despite my better judgment. \u00a0I was only able to eat about half of it and then felt compelled to throw it away, and I left.The place was dirty and dead.

Is it a lunchtime destination for a the business crowd (there isn't one in Rogers Park)? Is it a sports bar (not much sports)? Is it fast food place (too slow for that)? Is it a regular bar (no bartender)?It is hard tell, and therefore hard to judge. They may be succeeding when measured against their objectives, but I don't know what those are and don't really care. The place is always empty for a reason. When they close they will not be missed.=-=-=-=-=-=If you want more details keep reading. If you think I'm a blow hard; you are probably right, so go read another review.If you work for the restaurant and want to know how fix it; don't bother. Just close and let something interesting move into one of the better locations in the neighborhood.Let's start with the food: 4 starsMy cheese steak was good. Better than Pat's and Gino's in Philly, however (sorry Philly) those sandwiches aren't very good. Perhaps the best cheesesteak in the area, but not the best sandwich in the area; there are several better options to the north and south on Sheridan. Fries = Good. Better fries can be had west of the Red Line on Morse. For $10, they are pushing it. For only a few more dollars, I could be eating at real restaurant a few blocks away.The menu: 3 starsThe menu has a limited selection of \"pre-defined\" options. What is offered is good, but the process created by their menu is a pain in the arse. Instead, you are left with the ability to customize your culinary experience. This would be interesting, but proves to be cumbersome. Unless one is a regular, there is long period of time spent wading through a lengthy list of options prior to attempting to place an order.Options are good when interesting, but here we have a long list trivial variations. Why have 5 cheeses? If you know what makes the best cheesesteak sandwich, then suggest it with that. (perhaps it was 4 or 7, tough to tell because the menu was poorly formatted and tough to read). Then there is the fry bar with 35 optional toppings (priced by weight?). Fry bar? Why? I've never seen anyone bother with the effort. The sandwiches come with fries, so I am certainly not going to order more.The beer menu is not well planned. PBR. Some kind of generic \"light\" american lager (does it really matter which one?), 2 Brothers EPA (kinda light), something else light in flavor and color, and a Porter. Clearly not a menu planned by someone that cares about beer and has a desire to sell much of it.Service: 1 starHave to be careful here. The person that took my order was nice, but seemed to struggle as much as I did with the menu, couldn't really guide me through the process, and didn't have a suggestions. I don't really have any issues with that aspect of the service. It is what it is. All of the fast food restaurants within a mile have staff that are better at taking orders and moving transactions along that the staff here.The single star is for management and their offering. Perhaps more is deserved, as the restaurant roughly achieves it's service goal. The goal however appears to be to minimize staffing. I suspect that this will succeed, because it has a negative impact on service which appears to also minimize business.Place your order at the counter. Stand and wait (for 10 minutes on a slow day), or go find a seat? Not sure. Decided to sit.There is a place with a sign above it suggesting that there is \"Booze here\", however there is no bartender. Order your beer from the crack team at the counter.Atmosphere: -3 stars.A negative number, Is that allowed? Sure. The atmosphere seriously detracted from my experience.1. As mentioned above, there is a place labelled booze here, pretends to be a \"bar\". There is a counter (not a bar, a counter) with some stools in front of it. There is not a person working in this section, so all you are offering is a place with sigh above it.2. The chairs at the tables are non-padded, simple, wooden chairs. Fine for 20 - 30 minutes. I would never think about going there to watch a game.3. The \"sports bar\" does have several TVs. One a day with multiple baseball games, a NASCAR race, College Rugby 7s, golf, and more, we had: Tennis and a documentary on ESPN News that featured graphic pictures of the burns suffered by the subject prior to their road to recovery.The End.You may say, \"It's about f'ing time\".

About a week before, Fiancee finally gets Jackie on the phone. \u00a0Jackie says she has the order, and it's on her schedule. \u00a0She'll call a couple of days before the event, to confirm the order. \u00a0Sounds great! \u00a0Fiancee relaxes a bit. \u00a0Two days before the event. \u00a0Silence. \u00a0No calls, no emails.One day before the event. \u00a0Silence continues. \u00a0Fiancee calls Jackie. \u00a0Leaves a voicemail. \u00a0Calls again a couple of hours later. \u00a0Again a little later. \u00a0And again. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0Zero. WHAT'S THE STORY WITH THE CAKE?! \u00a05 PM, day before the bridal shower. \u00a0I say to Fiancee, \"Forget it -- let's just get a cake at the bakery.\" \u00a0We send Jackie a \"last chance\" email, and head off to the bakery. \u00a0There, we check email from our phone, and -- wow! -- Jackie lives and she says our cake is in production... and we can pick up on the far South Side. (Me: \"Where?! She's supposed to be in Rogers Park!\") \u00a0Fiancee calls her -- you guessed it, no answer. \u00a0We figure, time to get a Plan B, and get two cakes at the bakery. \u00a0(We'd find a use for them, one way or another.)At home, we look at the order forms: did we miss the new address? \u00a0Err, no -- there is no address or phone number listed. \u00a0(Why? \u00a0Why on earth not?!) \u00a0With all the web references (including this one) saying the place is in Rogers Park, we had no reason to think otherwise. Oops. We write another email (phone calls being useless), saying that the location is a surprise, and could we maybe meet her downtown. \u00a0No answer. \u00a0No phone call. \u00a0No email. \u00a0Nothing.At 6:14 AM on the day of the shower (!!!) we get an email. \u00a0Jackie says she is sorry for the \"misunderstanding\" and that we were \"not made aware\" that their \"main center\" has been moved to the South Side. \u00a0(Let's unpack this load of b.s.: we were \"not made aware\" and the \"misunderstanding\" occurred because she didn't bother to tell us. \u00a0And the \"main center\" is a kitchen in her house. \u00a0Not that there's anything wrong with that, but talk about avoiding responsibility for her own incompetence!)It went on to say that the order was cancelled because of \"a possibility of a no-call/no-show.\" \u00a0I was speechless: a \"possibility\"! Good thing we got those bakery cakes!Here's an irony -- our maid of honor lives 15 minutes from there. \u00a0We could have easily sent her to pick up the cake. \u00a0All Jackie had to do was CALL US THAT NIGHT; we would have figured it out and laughed it off. \u00a0Instead, she just sent an email saying our order was cancelled. \u00a0On the day of the bridal shower, without even the courtesy of a phone call. \u00a0In short: you can't rely on this outfit to be either courteous or even remotely professional. \u00a0Even if they charged nothing, it'd still be a ripoff. \u00a0Just stay away.", "rating": "1", "date": [2009, 7, 19]}}, "neighborhoods": ["Rogers Park"], "latitude": 42.0114708, "longitude": -87.6715698, "rating": "1.0", "times": {"Mon": ["8:00 am", "9:00 pm"], "Thu": ["8:00 am", "9:00 pm"], "Sat": ["8:00 am", "5:00 pm"], "Wed": ["8:00 am", "9:00 pm"], "Tue": ["8:00 am", "9:00 pm"], "Sun": ["8:00 am", "5:00 pm"], "Fri": ["8:00 am", "9:00 pm"]}, "price": "$", "categories": [["Bakeries", "bakeries"]], "address": ["Estes Ave"], "attributes": null, "category": "Food", "number_of_reviews": "2"}, "red-violin-wine-spirits-chicago": {"comments": {"3": {"description": "Great craft beer selections from the better breweries!

I don't know if \u00a0it's new owners, new cooks or both, coupled with a better menu, but the food is actually good here now and I don't hate myself after a meal.We've been back many times actually since discovering this place isn't total garbage anymore. This isn't fine dining by any means or anything out of the ordinary, its standard American pub fare but not low quality bar food and \u00a0the restaurant itself is very nice, inviting, warm, with rich dark wood everywhere, it's an upstanding looking place and a nice change from Morseland down the street that we've been to so many times its almost painful going now. The prices at both Act One and Morseland are basically the same too. Apps - their calamari is fresh, crunchy, not soggy, the breading doesn't fall off, good flavor, not bland. Their soft pretzels are phenom, made at some local bakery without the horrible huge salt chunks on the outside (cheese sauce is crummy and needs to be made with real cheese but it still suffices) and their Korean BBQ wings are very good, nice flavor change if you are looking for wings but don't want the norm.Their flatbreads are fun but the crust kinda weirds me out after a bit, I think because they are so thin, you can like, feel the grease on them? Because there is no dough to soak it up? Not sure how to explain it, still enjoyed them but they could probably improve the flatbread recipe itself. The boyfriend enjoys their burgers and turkey burgers (must order with sriracha garlic mayo, holy heavens).
