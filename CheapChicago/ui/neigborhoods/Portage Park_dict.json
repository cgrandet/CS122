I was not charged for them either. So I wound up with a wet italian beef. I think it is mostly ok. It's a thicker cut than other italian beef stands. The sandwich is cut in half and separately wrapped. I (and You) will have problems with beef falling out of the sandwich. Without peppers, there is only a faint flavor of italian seasoning (oregano?), and it is neither fiery nor 'hot'.French fries are included with the sandwich; and it is just as well. They are dreadful. They had the constituency of institutional frozen fries. They disintegrated when chomped. Many varieties of Pringles\u00ae have more potato flavor than these.I'm giving here a three-star rating because I suspect that the sandwich, dinners, and pasta side of the menu (although Tom Z. liked the panini) is \"second fiddle\" to the pizzas.Transit options: The #152 Addison bus ceases running westbound at 9:45, 7:10, & 7:20 pm on weekdays, Saturday, & Sunday, respectively.

My last haircut was done by Dora, and though she's more quiet, she's very thorough and gave me an exceptional cut. I LOVE it. She framed my hair nicely around my face and gave me exactly the layers I asked for. I've been charged between $23-27 for the shampoo, cut and style which I think is very affordable.

My first experience wasn't fabulous, but I decided to give them a second try.I got to the salon at my appointment time and met Nicole there. Everything was going great until I sat down in her chair. There was another 'stylist' curled up in the chair next to me. It became abundantly clear very early that I was going to have to listen to the asinine conversation of these two for my entire haircut. I'm not the kind of person that needs someone to talk to me the whole time, but I do want to be able to sit in peace. They were talking and swearing around me the whole time about having babies, missing periods, etc. Worse yet, they were talking bad about the salon, the manager and other stylists the rest of the time and that made me really uncomfortable. Evidentially, the manager had asked my stylist if she could take two appointments (beginning 45 minutes after the start of my appointment), and when my stylist told the other, she was pissed off because initially they were her appointments, so she complained and pouted the whole time I was there. The other stylist sat in the chair picking at her hair and complaining about how much it sucked working there until the manager came over and asked her if she wanted to take one of the appointments (thankfully, I couldn't hear the manager. I just gathered all this info from the asinine conversation). She said no and proceeded to complain about the salon and manager.So let's get back to the actual haircut. It sucks. Not really a haircut actually. The texture of my hair shouldn't feel like I need a haircut again one week after. I have long layers and she only cut the bottom layer. This presents multiple problems in that I got my hair cut so the dead ends would be gone and it could grow healthily, so now that's not going to happen correctly. Also since the layers are more or less the same length, it's not laying right and the bottom just poofs out. When she agreed to take these other appointments, I knew she was going to have to rush through my haircut and I was right. Nothing is even. She didn't check to see if the length matched by comparing the sides in the front, so it doesn't! The layers aren't even on same side. When comparing the length in the back, she took all the hair in the back, held it up, and cut straight across, so the middle of the back is shorter than the sides in the back. It's really the most haphazard haircut I've ever gotten. The bangs were one thing I was not going to be rushed through. She cut my bangs at a very dramatic angle, and I clearly have a more subtle angle as I wear them side-swept. I said something to that effect and she tried to assure me that it would look better when it dried, and I know that's not the truth. After she sort of fixed it, but clearly not to my liking, there was a chunk of bangs that was at least half an inch longer than the rest and didn't blend. It was so obviously wrong that I was mortified when I had to pull out the piece and demand that she cut it. It's still too long! She assured me that it would look better when I flat ironed it at home. All I could do was sit there fuming while she burnt my head with the hair dryer and scraped my scalp raw with the hair clips so I didn't scream or cry. Here's a free hint: If your client is wincing every time you clip the hair up, you're doing it wrong. Here's another one: If you don't notice your client is wincing, you should stop talking to the 'stylist' who is curled up in a ball in her chair.My worst haircut experience as an adult by far.The other time I visited, I saw Dora. She's very sweet. The reason I won't review higher is because it took really long, especially on my bangs, and I still wasn't very happy with them.The one star is for how nice Dora is, how affordable it is ($35 for a haircut) and how easy it is to get an appointment the same day.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 10, 7]}, "25": {"description": "Ever since I started coming here I have never had a bad experience.

I tried the clear beet borscht, which was rich tasting and well seasoned, and pickle soup, which tastes just like it sounds, a treat if you love pickles, and who doesn't? Sunflower rye bread went well with the soups. There are 3-4 varieties of poppy seed cake, and the cheese blintzes are out of this world. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the herring from a barrel, which was too briny for my taste.This is a pretty well run place, even though it can get crowded and the aisles are narrow. Numbers are called, people line up to check out, and some English is spoken, especially by the younger staff.

I read some of the other reviews on Luxe Blue before my appointment but they were not really helpful so I walked in optimistic.First. The receptionist was friendly and attentive but I did find it very classless to have their customers pay before the appointment but no big deal whatever. I started off with the microdermabraion with this extremely sweet and obviously well experienced polish women whom I wish I could remember her name. But she did a great job and started my appointment off nicely ( which is why I did give some stars)Next was time for my massage. ( again wishing I could remember names ) Took my clothes off , laid on the table, Ive had my share of massages so I knew the drill. I really hate to be the person to complain but so many things just started going wrong from that point. It was completely silent in the room which I didnt mind but most spas have relaxation music playing ( which was actually playing in the microdermabrasion room ) but for some reason wasnt in the next room I was in and the only reason it was brought to my attention was because all of the sudden I started only hearing every conversation everyone else in the place was having. The lady had began her massage where I felt uncomfortable for the sole fact that I could feel how uncomfortable she even was for some reason. It was almost like she was nervous to touch me. Number one way to spot a unexperienced masseuse is when they constantly ask you questions. PLEASE do not ask me one more time if i am okay ? or what would i like ? You as a masseuse should know the body I have never had to talk so much on the table. Meanwhile the music was actually broken so people were coming in and out of my room as I was laying on the table still naked under the blanket having people trying to figure out the music situation. Their solution at that point was to just put a speaker in my room where terrible and loud music then began to play right in my ear. After that I just didnt even want to continue laying down. My back way itching me from how light she was touching me, she kept doing the samethings over and over again because everytime something distracted her she would restart, the music was giving me a headache , I could still hear people talking around me. It was my birthday, I did not wanna stick around. Didnt even get to experience whatever the thai bodywrap wouldve consisted of but I was not worried about it. Awkward moment was walking out , everyone apologizing to me a million times , trying to figure out how to refund me now since I of course already paid upfront...... 6 business days later my refund was complete and the receptionist did follow up which I did appreciate. If youre gonna do the microderambraion session I would totally say go for it. As far as a massage goes.

Lisa did my make-up for my wedding - as well as the make-up for two of my bridesmaids - and we all looked absolutely beautiful! Lisa is a total pro and takes the time to really evaluate your skin and ask you questions about your event and what you like before diving in. Her attention to detail really shows. When I've been in other weddings and had my make-up done, I often feel the end result isn't \"me.\" That's not the case with Lisa. You look like yourself - only 100x's better! I especially loved the look of the false lashes and airbrushing - which artfully camouflaged my years of sun abuse. :) In terms of price, you really won't find a better value out there! I searched and searched and called a ton of different make-up artists and companies and Beauty Squad Chicago was the only one who quoted me an affordable price - which included a trial!!! Most places make you pay extra for the trial. Also, if you have three or more people in your party, Beauty Squad will travel to your location for free! We had so much fun drinking mimosas and getting ready in the comfort of my condo the morning of the wedding and I was glad we didn't have to travel to a salon.After following-up with Lisa regarding some products after my wedding, I found out that Beauty Squad also offers make-up tutorials and facials - which I will definitely be taking advantage of as well!

The first time I got a large with onions, green peppers, and sausage. Everything was fine. Told delivery would be an hour, delivery was an hour and ten minutes. Let me repeat, FOUR BLOCKS. Pizza was pretty good considering it wasn't as greasy as I typically like. Sausage was tasty, veggies were fresh as pizza veggies can be.The second time I ordered myself a small pizza with black olives, bacon, and ground beef (my favorite.) I'm used to getting ground beef as.... yuno... ground beef. Suparossa has some big 'ol nuggets of ground beef. Ranging in size from large marble, to larger than golf ball but smaller than tennis ball. Kindouv ridiculous. This second time I was also quoted an hour delivery, this time it showed up in 25 minutes. Awesome, now that makes sense since I'm FOUR BLOCKS away. Figured, hell, pizza in 25 minutes? That deserves a hearty tip. Tipped, walk back to feast, opened the box, all of the toppings were smashed to one side. What the hell was he doing, riding a bike with the pizza in his backpack? Who knows. Either way, I spread the toppings out as much as I could, and somehow, only about 60% of the pizza was covered. Got hungry, had to take the pizza out of his backpack and stop to eat some enormous ground beef nuggets to get the energy for the bike ride? Who knows.Too expensive to deal with a fast but jacked up pizza with all the toppings all over the place, and way too close to deal with delivery taking over an hour.

If you like buy one get one free pizza offers well they told me none are available at the time. Why this negative review. The last time they screwed up my salad dressing it was completely oil, as in 99.99 % oil you could not even smell any vinegar in it. I called in and spoke to the Manager, in typical italian fashing he told me he would send new dressing. I said no thanks because i am tired and this one is already covered in oil. He said next time I order just ask for him and he will take care of it. I agreed and was not worried about him making it up on my next order. When I called on another occasion, \u00a0and mentioned the above the girl on the phone said, all I get is $5.00 off. This is less than the cost of the salad that was ruined with oil.

First, I really wanted to like this place. Its in the neighborhood and they have tried to really create a cozy ambiance with a sort of artsy/retro vibe. However, there is much to be desired. I ordered the zesty turkey and a side of mac and cheese. The sandwich is over $6 (if I recall correctly) and only the sandwich comes. No pickle, no side of fruit, nothing. I only ate it and didn't say nothing because it took forever to come in the first place and I was super hungry. The waitress was very nice, but she seemed super shy and unattentive. I didn't want to keep bothering her because she acted like she was scared of people. My bread was super hard and tasted stale. The turkey also tasted old. There were no tomatoes on this sandwich, just a piece of bread. It was basically like the type of sandwich I could have made at home with few days old cold cuts. As for the mac and cheese, the owner claims it is made from high quality cheeses. In my opinion, it tastes like either Velveeta or powered cheese mixed with milk or cream. The mac and cheese was cold and very liquidy. 100 percent, it doesn't taste like it was made with real cheese. I have made home made mac and cheese before. I have also been to restaurants that made very good home made mac and cheese like Priscilla's Ultimate Soul Food cafeteria in Hillside. Yes, they did take the mac and cheese off the bill, but its not right to throw it up to the face's of the customers. Ultimately, I would have been better off going to a diner if I wanted a sandwich. My suggestion to Fannie's is to perhaps invest in a panini maker and/or do something to spice up their sandwiches like maybe use avocado or something. Before I left, I also felt terrible for complaining and I thought that maybe their strength is their baked goods so perhaps, I should try a cupcake. I also needed something sweet as a sort of palate cleanser after eating the stale sandwich until I could get home and brush my teeth. The chocolate cupcake was super dry.

However, when I got towards the end of the burger the bleu cheese just became overwhelming I mean there was just SO much of it. I would suggest to ask for it easy or on the side if they can. That's really my only complaint it got kind of soggy and just weird so I didn't finish the entire thing. The Parmesan garlic fries are a MUST! Perfectly crunchy full of flavor and everyone in the restaurant was also raving about the same fries. The customer service is amazing. Two women helped us throughout our whole dinner and they were super sweethearts and so so friendly. Because of this I'm really going for the 5 rather than a 4 just because of the ending experience with the burger this made up for it.

The pork belly was too chewy and unfortunately I had to take it off because I couldn't bite through it while it was in the burger. I wish I had ordered a bacon burger instead. The burger meat was...different? First off it was not juicy at all, very dry, maybe it was more lean, but I know what lean ground beef tastes like that, and that is not it either. It tasted overcooked even though I saw it was pink bc I ordered it medium well so I'm not sure what was going on there, but I didn't like it.

So I went on a Saturday night with the groupon, and also my girlfriend. It was bad. I felt like they were punishing me for using a groupon and not paying full price. It took almost 45 minutes to get served a burger and fries. What got me mad though was that my girlfriend got served first, along with most of the tables in the restaurant, despite that I had ordered before any of them. They brought out my girlfriends burger (she ordered right after me) and I was waiting for mine. I saw them handing out food to people who had just sat down. So I went to the cashier and asked her to check on mine. Some woman taking a phone call heard me complaining and she told me to sit down and wait, that the restaurant is busy and I will get to eat whenever they get to my order. I thought this woman was extremely rude both with what she said and how she said it. She didn't even put down the phone to tell me this. Luckily a few minutes later a man came to my table and explained that he heard me talking with this lady. He had me give him my order and I could tell he went into the kitchen and had them make my order right away. This man, probably the owner or manager, was the ONLY one working who had any interest in solving my problem. I was about to leave and demand a refund when he talked to me, so kudos for fixing the problem before it became worse. Besides him being helpful, I had a terrible time. I think they rushed cooking my burger, because even though I ordered it cooked medium, it made me sick the next day. The reason I didn't send it back was because I was afraid it would take another 45 min to re cook. I saw the other employees rushing guests for sitting \"too long\" at the tables eating. This is extremely unprofessional and just wrong. They charge $9-11 for a burger, to make you wait almost an hour. For a burger that isn't all the way cooked. To be rushed out by the staff if you want to enjoy and take your time with the burger. All these negatives aside, the food does taste good. Everything from the bun and sauce and meat and bacon and even fries. I have to say if you do want to try brgrbelly there a few tips to enjoy it even more. 1) call first! The menu is online, so call ahead and avoid a terrible wait. 2) if possible, take the order to go. The sitting area is extremely small and overcrowded. When it is busy, the dining room borders on being a fire hazard. This is a complicated review, because the food was really good. I think I would give it a 5/5 just for the food.BUT between all the problems with the wait, service, and value ($15 almost for burger and fries).

What it is: it is a museum with artwork done by people who were involved in the Vietnam War. \u00a0This means people from BOTH sides and it includes nurses, etc., not just soldiers. \u00a0It is NOT a place where patriotism is the only way of thinking. \u00a0I am most definitely not a flag-waving, right-wing supporting person. \u00a0I am about as left as it gets, in fact. \u00a0But, I do think this place has an incredible amount of history to teach -- about war and its possible effects on the people involved. \u00a0One of the most interesting things about writing this paper was that I talked to most of the guys that were involved in the museum at that time and they were an extremely diverse set of people. \u00a0They represented the anti-military perspective all the way to the I-Wish-I-Had-Been-to-'Nam perspective. \u00a0This is why it is hard to state specifically what the museum stands for. \u00a0I think the museum stands for whatever you bring to it -- your own perspective will indubitably color your take on this place.I'd like to say that it's an anti-war museum -- that is the effect it had on me (even more than I already felt anti-war). \u00a0When you walk in, by the front desk, there is a quote on the wall (there was 6 years ago, anyway) by a Buddhist guy that seemed pretty overtly anti-war, but if I recall, it says something like: war isn't child's play, it's serious business, and if you're going to do it, you damn well better understand what you are taking on. \u00a0And, while I know that some of the guys there would disagree with me, if ever there was a place that spoke about post traumatic stress disorder, this is the place. \u00a0I can see (from their website) that it's a different set of people running the museum now, so I don't know if it's the same. \u00a0I know for a fact that my view on the content was heavily influenced by my discussions with Ned (the main guy at the time, whose last name I am forgetting) and so it may have changed. \u00a0His artwork was up there and it spoke to the incredible emotional toll that the war had; there was a lot of artwork there that was angry/painful/sad. \u00a0I don't know anyone that I took there who left without shedding at least one tear.Uff. \u00a0I have gone on and on. \u00a0All I really want to say, I guess, is: go. \u00a0Go see what it's about. \u00a0Support it if you think it's good enough. \u00a0If it's still as good as it was a few years ago, it is something that this city can't afford to lose -- it's something this country can't afford to lose. \u00a0It is critically important to be considering the effects of war particularly at this time. \u00a0No matter how you feel about war, it is a fact that we are going to have to deal with the consequences as the soldiers keep coming back from Iraq -- the effects run deep.", "rating": "5", "date": [2007, 3, 31]}, "4": {"description": "This museum and it's work is nothing short of amazing. If you are ever in the area, a visit here will not disappoint. I am currently in graduate school working on my Ph.D. in Art Therapy. I also lost my dad, a special forces soldier of 20 years, in 2004. Unbeknownst to us he was suffering from PTSD and commited suicide less than two months after returing from a combat mission. Art has helped me come to terms and cope with his death. Over the past ten years we, as a society, and as family members of the military, have certainly become more aware of PTSD and the struggle to provide judgement-free mental health care to our service members, and it is because of places like the National Veterans Art Museum. My father served in a unit of the Army that was highly selective. They recruited individuals and screened specifically for an signs of mental illness. So it is no wonder that if a service member at some point felt they needed the help of a psychologist, they might be reluctant to seek it, seeing as how it would potentially disqualify them from a particular position. \u00a0But when you think about it, shouldn't it be the individuals who can go to war, watch their friends die, take another person's life, and then come back to their families and not be uterly impacted, the ones we should be worried about? If you ask me, PTSD is the \"normal\" side effect. Not having PTSD sould be the disorder. Places like the NVAM are essential. They not only provide a crutial outlet for these service members, but they educate the public. They also let other service members know that they are not alone in their experiences.

I honestly feel more discomfort when I first clean it than when he puts the needle through.

I'm fine with this since it is remarkably cheap, but for all of the people with high expectations for preparation this might not be for you.

I enjoyed the seasoning, however it was not juicy and there seemed to be a little bit more bone and breading than meat. The frying wasn't done the way I personally prefer it, but I can understand the appeal. Some people prefer more of a dry, crispy fry. If that's what you like this would be excellent! A couple sections of meat on my chicken were way too tough for my liking though.In it's entirety I'd say the chicken is just okay, but for the pricing and the delivery time I'd say you should give this place a shot (if you're ordering delivery or pickup).The biscuits should GUARANTEE your visit.

I have NEVER had a problem in this restaurant. I didn't bat an eyelash when my \"good deal\" place, who used to have cheese and sour cream come as part of the taco without charging more....started charging per taco like other places. Yeah, I know the economy. So I let it go. We go in there the other day and started ordering tacos. Adding cheese to the many we were ordering for the family. On the menu it says 35 cents extra per taco (which is a little on the high side already, for a sprinkle of cheese). The gentleman, which BTW I've never really cared for much when I've come across him working (I think it's the husband of the lady who is always in there...they own it). He starts ringing up each taco with an extra 45 cents each per taco. My husband mentions to him. \"It says 35 cents, not 45 cents\". His response was in an extremely crabby and pissed off attitude....\"Prices are subject to change\"! Hmmm... okay....so is it just because he feels like it today he is going to charge an extra 10 cents PER TACO over the 35 cents?? So our response was...\"yeah, well my order is subject to change too, and I don't want it\"...so we left and tried the place across the street. I'm not sure if I want to go back??? I think I'm going to have to really watch my bill, because who knows what he \"feels\" like charging at any given moment.

I hate to down this place but I hope the new owners read this because this is a mild suggestion. Ever since new owners or management has taken over, the meat portions on a taco, torta, enchilada, etc. has turn into the size of GROUND BEEF or pellet size crumbs I can feed to my fish!The taste as well has changed, I get it, char-grilled but does it really have to taste like you scraped it literally \"off the grill\"? The previous owners had bigger sized steak meat as well. I almost thought they had my order wrong when I ordered an enchilada plate with steak not ground beef. The portions here have always been small visually unlike Amigo Chino with their extraordinary size torta that 4 people can eat but I have always loved the meat from Mucho Gusto. But now the taste has become a disaster,I understand increase the heat equals faster service but don't sacrifice flavor. I rather wait for good cooked meal than to have fast food garbage. Either scrape off all the excess charred burnt tasting meat off the grill before cooking or lower the fire, cause everyone knows how a burnt tasting piece of meat taste like on a grill and this is not even a t-bone steak, its little pellets of meat that pigeons can begin to eat now.A fancy little tablet looking register, a pretty face to go behind it slash waitress, and customer service has improved but all that can only go so far. If you don't have good tasting food, I don't know what will happen to you guys. Now every time I order I hope that the meat just didn't burn in flames.

I did not want to try Cochiaro's Pizza [c.v.] so soon again. I walked the four blocks north to Irving Park. I rejected the chain restaurants there (although I did look at the menu board at the Dairy Queen), and opted for Mucho Gusto. (There is Taqueria Amigo Chino [yelp.com/biz/taqueria-am\u2026, _another_ Mexican restaurant, across the street from it.)I was convinced to try it because it has a $3.99 ground beef burrito special (currently). The venue is small. That is why I voted \"no\" on \"Good for Groups\". There are six tables. I sat at one of them.Even with this $3.99 special, if you eat in, you get the basket of tortilla chips and two salsas, red and green. The green salsa is more fiery. I preferred the red salsa. But both of them were made on the premises [i.e.: Not poured out of a one-gallon tin can]. The burrito arrived in five minutes. The ground beef was good. I did not specify 'no tomatoes' in my burrito (which I usually do, but I forgot this time), but the amount of tomatoes therein [diced] was not so overwhelming that I was scooping it out. The onions and lettuce were in equal proportion to the tomatoes.I change off from steak burritos [carne asada] to ground beef burritos [picadillo] occasionally. This was one of the better ground beef burritos I have had.I'm giving it a four-star rating. It is in the center of four stars. The slightly dishevelled appearance of the venue is due to that this is the family's restaurant. There is probably not a salaried person working here. That itself wouldn't prevent me from giving it five stars; but there is also the fine edge that I think you will go over ten bucks a person when you eat here. That holds it down a \u00a01/2-star. If you consume pork [I try to avoid this.], you can request a pork taco for one dollar.Transit options: This is easy. Central is the road to | from the Forest Glen Garage for many of the east-west bus routes including the #80 Irving Park & the #X80 Irving Park Express.

I needed that extra time and then some!

The massage I got from him was definitely not a one size fits all. \u00a0And because he paid special attention to my problem areas, my neck has never felt this kind of \"release\" I am experiencing today. I can't remember the last time it has felt actually \"relaxed\" like this. He has an uncanny knack for really finding the source of your pain. \u00a0I will quote Diane S. \"he always manages to find *just* the spot it's radiating from in the most unexpected places.\" I couldn't have put it better, Diane.

Very communicative about where to get at and what pressure I liked. But not overly chatty so I could relax.Respectful - I don't like people touching my face, so when the therapist actually ASKED if I wanted a face massage, I was so happy! Instead I had a great head massage which was very relaxing.Massage table and linens - Felt very luxurious and cozy.Some high maintenance details that would have made this experience better:Sauna - They put me in the sauna before my massage and offered tea and a snack. The thing is, when its 92 degrees in a box, you really want cold water, not hot water. Some ice water would have been fantastic and would have made the sauna heat a bit more bearable (or if you really want to be fancy, a washcloth on ice/cucumbers is always a nice touch to keep cool). Also, I wasn't sure how long I was supposed to sit in there so I was just sitting there kind of waiting for someone to show up. Plus, all the magazines were a year old which didn't help the time pass.Oil used for the massage - Honestly, it was straight oil. I really didn't think people used that anymore (my chiro uses Biotone or some other kind of lotion). But this is my own personal paranoia as I break out easily, definitely not a deal breaker for me.Sanitized Comb/Brush after steam shower - Would have been nice to have one, but now I know just to bring my own next time (there was a brush, just wasn't clean).Sandals - I know I said this above, but clean shower sandals would have been great.The pros most definitely outweigh the cons.

The Place:It's somewhere between clinical and spa (massage/facial, but no aromatherapy or body wraps). The shower was nice, but in a hall where I felt like everyone could hear me. The changing/locker area was also bizarrely small and led via a curtain to an awkward couples massage room that was not for me, but I got a robe and clean flip flops so it was just fine.The Massage: Chisato rocked my rocky bod. She was great about asking about pressure and trouble areas, but not too chatty. It was 90 amazing minutes of pure kneading heaven, worth every penny. I liked that it combined even pressure over-the-sheets massage and traditional swedish massage with a lotion. I think the table in there could use a skoot though, as she kicked the metal trash can a couple times, not so relaxing, but I had almost fallen asleep (for the first time every during a massage!) so it was probably good.The owner is fantastic about setting things up, no pressure to upgrade on anything and he's eager to please in a non-confrontational way.

We had to go up to HER to say we're done. She didn't ask if we wanted to split the bill or how much eat item was so we could figure it out ourselves... she didn't even show us the bill. She told us the total and stood there waiting for us to all try to figure out how much to give her. We had to ask her how much each food item was ourselves. The whole thing was very very disorganized. Another thing was that the A/C was on blast. It was blowing right on our area and we were freezing!

My sweet waitress brought me water and a menu. When she returned a couple minutes later I ordered my meal of Tripe Soup, the Roasted Duck, and the Apple Strudel. Minutes later she served my soup and a small plate of three kinds of cold cabbage salads. The creamy slaw had just a light touch of dairy. The vinegar and carrot had a slight sour flavor, while the beet salad has a slight sweet flavor. None of the three had a strong flavor of any spices. They were different from each other in a very quiet way. The Tripe Soup was a delight! A hearty beefy broth contained several vegetables and nice long thin strips of soft tripe. I could have a whole meal if they served a larger dinner-sized portion, but this appetizer size was just perfect. Next she brought the Roasted Duck which came with a scoop of mashed potatoes and a small portion of cranberry sauce. The duck skin was vey crispy and, again, very light on spices. The meat near the skin was drier than the meat closer to the bone. Adding a bit of the wonderful cranberry sauce to the meat added the necessary moisture and complimentary flavor. The apple stuffing was very soft and moist and was a great addition. The mashed potatoes were hot but needed butter and salt that was on the table to make them more pleasing. Finally I was served the lightest strudel I've ever eaten. Normally I get my knife and fork ready to tear into my strudel, but this was different. It was more like a crumb cake than a layered pastry dessert. Only a fork was needed to cut thru the light cake and apple filling. Again, this dish was made with a light hand. The apples weren't chewy or sugary sweet, they were just right. The chocolate sauce is mainly there for show. It's really not necessary to add anything to this already uniquely executed dessert. Whip cream, yes. Caramel sauce, maybe. Chocolate sauce, no. This was a great way to end a comforting and hearty meal. INSIDE: More than a dozen booths surround the walls, while the tables and chairs(for larger parties) were in the middle of the space. Modern black & white framed photos are hung on wood paneled walls. Mauve and orange vinyl cover the booth seats. The d\u00e9cor is dated but everything is clean and well-kept. The Men's bathroom and was clean and the sink had HOT water for washing hands. The bar was stocked with the normal brands of liquor but there are no top-shelf spirits or modern cocktail choices. OUTSIDE: The building fa\u00e7ade is dated but clean and has a homey feeling to it. There is plenty of free main street parking on Lawrence. The neighborhood is quiet and family-friendly. OVERALL: Smakosz is a good choice for those who want to eat authentic Poilsh food. A warm family feeling is all around you and it shows in the food as well. If you're not a fan of overly spiced food, then the dishes here are very accessible to you. The flavor comes from the basic ingredients and the rich Polish tradition which can put a smile on anyone's face.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 5, 4]}, "0": {"description": "This place is amazing!

Although it was the one steak at the store that didn't have grey color to it, when I took it out of the packing I discovered a large grey dis coloring that had been covered by the sticker. I had to cut a huge piece of the steak off and throw it out (should have gone to Mariano's like my fianc\u00e9 did for his steak). The next day as we were going to eat then bbq pulled chicken I made in the crock pot, I opened to pack of buns I bought from here and they were stale. I couldn't believe it.

Where to start and where to finish. Well, let me start off by saying I grew up in this area and have been coming here for over 15 years on and off. So that in itself should say something. Overall, it's very very decent and really a hit or miss. Back back in the day, Jenny's business was just nearly starting to flourish. Her salon was nice but somewhat still dinky. She had very nice employees who did a good job on nails and feet. Throughout the years when her business started to grow she started doing massive changes to the salon. She added a top floor for spa parties, massage and facial services, redid her entire first floor as far as the sinks, chairs, nail stations, etc. She has come a long way and has really built a successful business.I'm not sure if that change has anything to do with the new tude of the place but the service has gone down hill. There was a girl I use to go to for my nails also named Jenny who left a few years ago. From the way it seemed she left on bad terms. This was a shame cause she was so good. Still, I came back a lot. Her daughters started working there and every time I have been in they are really just the rudest. They clearly do not want to be there and always have a stank face on. Since then, I haven't been back in the last 8 years or so. I just recently came back since I was in the area for a full set. They close at 8 and it was around 730 so I knew I was pushing it. There was no one in sight but the workers and the doors were closed. Jenny was nice enough to let me in and recognized me right away. Charlie was still there who has been doing nails there for several years now. He is not the friendliest with me but I have seen him be overly friendly with a few other clients. I tried to make convo but it wasn't happening. I was nervous because way back when when he first started he sucked but he did get better over the years. We finished at 8 and it was standard pricing 35.00 for gel full set.Overall, it came out OKAY. Other than the fact he cut my skin towards the end with the nail machine. Didn't even use anything as far as healing liquid (like they normally do) just let it chill there like it was whatever.I don't know if I'll be back here anytime soon.

WHAT?!?!? I chose my color and I could tell by his look something was wrong, but instead of speaking to me about the issue he just continued painting my nails. The nail polish was old and was not going on smoothly, but by the time I noticed he had already done my entire right hand and half my left. I have gotten multiple no chip manicures before and they take quite awhile, and have many layers of polish and coatings. He finished mine so quickly which is not normal for a no-chip. The nail polish was not smooth and perfect like normal manicures, it was rigid and bumpy. It looked like I had painted my own nails.

They shaped my toenails in the oddest manner possible. How hard is it to just cut straight across? They gave me a hard time when I requested that they just cut them straight across and keep them short. That cannot be a strange request. They charged me full price for a mani/pedi for a 5 year old - even though all they did was apply polish. She had a fingernail that needed to be trimmed. They painted it even though it was scraggly. There was polish all over her cuticles. They missed a major spot on my chin wax and refused to fix it then - or the next day when I spoke to the owner. They were happy to do the wax the next day - for full price. We weren't there at a terribly busy time, yet they rushed us out the door. I asked if we could wait until our toes were dry.

Both the entrees were delicious - fresh and tasty. They were pretty big portions too; we brought home leftovers. The ambience was quiet; there was only one other patron there, and the tv was on the news/sports, but it wasn't too terribly loud. It's nice for a date night. They also have a rooftop, and it's probably busier in the summers. The only drawback was that their credit card machine wasn't working but they don't have an ATM, which didn't make sense because they should have told us before we sat down.

The place was completely packed and I have no idea how servers get around, I'd be knocking things over right and left. My mom ordered the mahi mahi tacos which she loved. They came with a lot of sides and salsas. I attempted the english muffin burger but they were out of some ingredient (can't remember since I'm writing this 3 months later) so I ordered the chicken tacos instead. I honestly wasn't disappointed because my meal was delicious. My partner ordered the double decker turkey burger which was huge. I tried this too and it also had a great flavor. I'd love to come back but this place always seems to be booked, rightfully so. If you are a yelper like me, you should check in when you arrive because we scored a free order of guacamole. We also ordered a cookie to go and had it later in the evening. These are a must!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 12, 30]}, "13": {"description": "Loved this place overall!

She was indifferent about the brunch menu because she didn't know if brunch was still being sereved. I was worried about this because I specifically made a brunch reservation.

I asked before we ordered, is there anything on the menu that you're out of? The answer was no. We should have everything. So we placed our drink or and Carrot Cheese Cake Muffin. I was very excited about this, heard great things about from other people. Our drinks took a long while to come finally when they did the server said sorry we are out of the carrot muffins, so we ordered the cinnamon roll. The same mistake happened again as it did with the muffin. The server put the order in to realize, since it never came to the table, you were out of the Cinnamon rolls as well. Getting irritated. Also the server came back to the table after the fact, food order already went in to ask my girlfriend if she wanted a side salad with her dish and then when my girlfriend ordered her cocktail, it was after the drink was ordered, the server came back a second time to the table to ask what kind of vodka. All these questions should be asked in the moment as the order from the table is being placed. A sad experience had from a place that has exceptional food.

Maybe it's just that it's a Sunday evening, but I cannot get over how terrible this pizza truly was. It was not cut into slices before it was delivered, arrived pretty much cold (maybe \"lukewarm,\" to be nice), and was missing one of the major ingredients listed in its description. It was supposed to be a Margarita thin crust pizza (fresh tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella). There were no tomatoes on the pizza AT ALL. There seemed to be a little bit of sauce around the edges but none actually between the cheese and crust of the rest of the pizza. The cheese was pure rubber consistency-- I was able to pick the entire layer of cheese off the pizza with one finger. Lastly, there were 4 pieces of basil that tasted like they had gone bad. Not wanting the purchase to be a complete waste, I shoved two \"slices\" down my throat. The consistency of it in my mouth was one of the grossest textures ever. Not worth the money. I wouldn't even had accepted it if it were free. If you decide to order from here, beware!!!

I only knew this place as Supparosa so seeing this modern dining room was a breath of fresh air for the neighborhood. The menu keeps to the Italian roots of Supparosa but just like the decor there were some modern takes and classics. The prosciutto wrapped dates were hit with everyone and the beef carpaccio was an unexpected surprise. Who knew raw beef could be that good?. Everything else I tried seemed like care went into creating it. I'll say this. If you're thinking about going somewhere like olive garden to get \"italian\" food. Give Legno a try instead. The prices are pretty reasonable and you'll get quality. Plus if you live on the northwest side you won't even need to go into the city.

The lighting where we sat was way to bright but they eventually turned it down and that helped. My immediate reaction, once seated (which was awkward), was trying to kill fruit flies that were attacking our table. We spent most of the night swatting bugs, not very romantic. As for the awkward start to the night, my husband was a little turned around and instead of going in through the front door, he brought us around to the side, we walked in and the hostess was rude and then rolled her eyes when I asked if we could sit at the 4 top, rather than the 2 top right next to the bar. Mainly I didn't want to be in the bar, I also wanted more space, as I knew we would be getting more than 2 plates. The place was nearly empty at the time and there were a ton of 4 tops available. I was thrown off by her attitude but seeing her throughout the night, I think that's just who she is. Outside of her, everyone was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the trio appetizers with the zucchini flower, arancini and hand rolled croquette, as well as an order of the prosciutto wrapped dates. The dates were amazing, even my husband who doesn't usually like dates, enjoyed them. The arancini was very good, the zucchini flower was delicious, the croquette was slightly cool when we got to it and was a little mushy - all of the sauces were very tasty.For dinner we ordered the crispy pork shoulder and the brick chicken vesuvio - both were good but not good enough that I would go back for them. The pork was crispy and moist on the inside but the polenta was crunchy and that confused me. The chicken was really well cooked with amazing flavor but the fingerling potatoes were actually small slices of potato and not what we expected, they also serve it with arugula (our favorite) and cherry tomatoes on the side - my husband said, if they provided some dressing or something with the arugula it would be a great dish, instead he was confused.The wine menu is pretty small, although my husband found beer that he liked.The location for us is great and with the HUGE parking lot across the street I'm sure we'll try it again, maybe for a pizza and beer night with friends. Maybe even try out the outside seating. I wanted to really like this place but in a city of this size, with all of the incredible places we can go to dinner, it just wasn't special for my birthday dinner - I agree with another reviewer, if you want Olive Garden, go here instead as the prices are probably about the same, but if you want amazing Italian food there are SO many better options.", "rating": "3", "date": [2015, 10, 9]}, "45": {"description": "Portage Park is definitely trying to up the scene!

The Chicken had a yummy white wine sauce that the tomatoes soaked in, and the duck ravioli was just the right amount, but a little more on the chicken sauce - it had pistachios in it but I think it would have been better as a pur\u00e9e.

I'm giving them three stars because a lot of what we ate was truly delicious, and our server George was very personable and attentive. There were some missteps though. We had fried calamari, and the batter was light and crispy and delicious, but the marinara was bland. Needed a little kick. My husband had the fris\u00e9e salad with pears which he said was delicious. So here's where things get a bit tricky... They sat a large number of tables at once, which led to our calamari taking 20 minutes to come out. ( We sat down at about 6:20pm on a Friday night.) My husband actually got his salad before the appetizer came out, which was a little odd. No big deal though. When the food came out, about 20 minutes after the calamari, my lobster roll looked great- and it was. It was buttery, filled with huge chunks of lobster claw, with a delicious garlic aioli and fresh arugula. Yum. The tomato bisque that came with it was fine, but nothing to write home about. My husband ordered an evening special, which included a yellowtail filet, gnocchi and some kind of red sauce stew with capers...it wasn't good. Before that came out, however, he looked down at what was set in front of him and realized that it was not what he ordered. Within 5 minutes, the manager (we think) brought out the correct dish, but offered waaaaay to much info on what had gone wrong in the kitchen. The apology was definitely appreciated but we didn't need that much info. Sadly, he was unable to finish his meal. The fish was dry and the rest of the dish could not make up for it. We were prepared to leave feeling disappointed this time, but then George brought out a complimentary dessert: quite possibly the best tiramisu I've ever had. It was perfect and delicious. And my husband's dinner was comped because he didn't enjoy it. So overall, we felt positive when we left, and we will go back- this was our first visit, and I think we will try going back on a less busy night to avoid some of the inevitable goofs that can happen when a kitchen gets overwhelmed with too many tables at once. George assured us that we should give Legno another shot soon, and I think we will. One other note- this just made me laugh...in the bathroom, which was very nice with pretty Kohler sinks and nice soaps, there was a basket on the sink containing what I thought were hand towels for drying your hands- those nice ones that are kind of like paper towels but feel a bit more like cloth. They turned out to be regular dinner napkins, and I actually burst out laughing when the one I grabbed dissolved in my wet hands.

My mom adds cheese and sour cream to hers. I'm assuming but can't be sure because it's not posted anywhere that this should cost no more than $2. My total comes to $20.75, at which point I ask why because my estimate in my head is lower. (16 plus tax)The cashier starts to mumble something when the other woman there jumps in and points to a handwritten sign above her head on a wall. She tells me that they have to raise prices temporarily because of the prices of meat but does not say what the new prices are. I just sort of shook my head and said whatever because I didn't want to make a scene of any kind. \u00a0Their prices are on the wall, printed on cards and they even had a sign for the pastor tacos for $2 on the sidewalk!!!

Not sitting in the fridge old, but like they were sitting on the vine too long - making them dry, starchy, and lacking any sweetness. I've done this a few times after leaving my own string beans in the garden past their prime.Of course because I'm a glutton, I also ordered beef Kung pao and Singapore noodles. I was disappointed by the kung pao vegetables: celery, green pepper, water chestnuts, and bok choy. None of them are particularly flavorful, but they were fresh. Singapore noodles were good and had a nice amount of meat, but there was no curry.

But TWICE now they have put me in danger with faulty \"repairs\" and accessory installations. I ended up at Rudy's bc they had the bike I wanted ready to go. Along with the bike purchase came all kinds of perks such as free tune ups. Well, this is the last place I would get tuned up after these two experiences.Experience 1: I buy my bike and a bunch of accessories. I ask the VERY nice and friendly burnout looking young kid to install my accessories, including a basket. He does. On the way home, my third time riding a bike in 20 years, the handlebars just drop an inch or more while I am riding. Apparently he forgot to tighten it when he installed my basket. I went to the shop on Lawrence at Western and they fixed it, free of charge. Experience 2: I overload my basket and it snaps, just a couple of weeks later. I bring it back to Rudys for repair. I get helped by the young burnout kid again. I tell him I snapped my basket and it wont stay up and told him I actually find it kind of cumbersome for everyday use and that I want a bike rack on the back for more options, since the basket is removable. He \"fixes\" the basket and puts on the bike rack. On my way home, my pedals start clicking like I am changing gears when I am not. Also, the minute I put something VERY light in my newly\" fixed\" basket, it falls down again. I take my bike the next day to the much closer to my home 5 star rated Turin's shop in Lincoln Square...The very professional associate there fixes my basket with extra reinforcements and tells me it looks like my gears are grinding bc one of my back wheels was put on a little crooked. Fixes it all for $15. Rudys charged me $12 in labor and didnt use a brake wire to reinforce my basket like Turins did. He said that was $5 of the $15, which makes their labor charge even cheaper than Rudy's faulty one. Bike runs great now and basket seems very sturdy in its place.Rudys put me in danger, and I cannot stand for that. I am a brand new cyclist and spent a lot of money on a brand new bike so I knew I would be safe. I will not be returning, even for my free tunes ups.

Left to wander the streets of Chicagoland in search of a new, easily attainable location. And until such a time, will suffer the consequences of both the good and the bad of searching.The place is old and dusty looking inside, much like their dirty, decor-free fish tank. Although properly fed, their goldfish live apathetic lives because of it. Much could be associated in how we digest their food. It's a Mom and Pop kind of place operating on a shoestring budget, so one cannot expect too much.

At the time, the cook was in the middle of having his lunch and reading the paper. So, I waited for the counter lady to finish her phone call, placed an order and took a seat. I ordered a lunch special with orange chicken which comes with chicken fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or 2 crab rangoon and a can of soda. I asked for an egg roll but for whatever reason the ol' lady gave me 2 pcs of crab rangoon. It was decent, nicely fried and filled with a lightly sweet cream cheese. I also ordered shrimp chow fun. (Per reviews and photos online, this sounded good.) Jumbo shrimp pieces with bean sprouts, carrots, water chestnuts and flat, wide rice noodle. It's a \"dry\" entree that is stir fried. (For a little difference, you could request they make \u00a01/2 of the noodles well done. This would add a crunch to them.) \u00a0They went too heavy with the fish sauce, because that was kicking up a stink in my car (also the following day when reheating, the stink was everywhere. I cook with fish sauce sometimes but try to use it sparingly. The smell can be offputting for some.) I requested that they make the fried rice spicy as well as the noodle dish and they obliged. Both were tasty when prepared. I'm not for certain whether the rice was made fresh at the time. I saw a very large rice cooker in the back and am aware that fried rice is prepared in advance, then steamed to life when ordered. In any case, it was steamed just right and if I'd had that alone, it was good. The shrimp was fresh, meat soft. \u00a0The orange chicken was stringy and rubbery, when I heard it dropped into the fryer I knew immediately it was prepared from frozen. The food is about a 3 to 3.5 star. \u00a0They use MSG fo'sho and I was lax when ordering, so I was left in a haze of funky, headache-inducing nausea. I felt gross after. \u00a0So, for those of you that dislike MSG as I do, it's a good reminder. Request, Request, Request-it removed.

\u00a0No acrid bitter aftertaste..it's smooth like silk. \u00a0It usually costs only $2 a brick...which is around 10 ounces. \u00a0And for those who do like junkfood, they also have packaged of pizza puffs and hashbrown patties that taste exactly like McDonald's. \u00a0I'm not fond of their baked goods or certain prepared meats/ seafoods, but I'm overly cautious that way. \u00a0What I insist is one of the best things that they offer prepared is their home made pico de gallo and guacamole. \u00a0FUCing amazing! \u00a0We go through those in less than 2 days. \u00a0If I run out of guacamole, I will cheat and mix a few avocados with their pico de gallo.Funny story, the other day while shopping, my know it all 2 year old asked if he could have a donut. \u00a0He picked a pink frosted with sprinkles. \u00a0He had already eaten, but wanted a snack. \u00a0I wanted to get the trip over with as soon as possible so I indulged him, and I didn't want to deal with any whining. \u00a0The donut did not look very good...definitely alot of food color. \u00a0He took one bite and said, Mommy, this is yucky. \u00a0I still had to pay for it, so when we got to the counter, he insisted on telling the clerk that their donuts were yucky and that he did not like it. \u00a0I was totally mortified but found it somewhat amusing that it had stuck in his head the entire trip. \u00a0I am sure that anyone looking at my cart probably thinks that I do not feed my family well as I buy the junk food portion of our grocery list here. \u00a0I do also buy alot of fresh produce here as it is dirt cheap and the quality is very good, much better than Jewel usually.There are three things that I want to pass on about this store besides the fact that they carry the things that you shouldn't eat. \u00a0One, this is not a handicap friendly store. \u00a0The aisles are really narrow. \u00a0The checkout lane is so tight and overstocked with misc merchandise, you can barely fit your cart through. \u00a02nd, if you know when link cards are replenished, or food stamps given out...avoid this place like the plague. \u00a0It is the worst time to shop there. \u00a03rd, there are some real characters here, in and out of the store. \u00a0I was not pleased about being approached by a creepy vagrant while trying to unload my groceries with my son present. \u00a0He just stood there with his hand out, way too close for my comfort without speaking. \u00a0Guess what, I can't remember how to speak English or Spanish all of the sudden either. \u00a0If he wants to speak with sign language, read my middle finger.Update: 5/24/08I'm doomed. \u00a0I just found out that a Tamale guy sells his tamales outside on weekends. \u00a0I purchased 6 of these for $4.50. \u00a0The more you buy, the more you save. \u00a0Christ. \u00a0It was so FUCing good, I was speechless. \u00a0I have never had such an incredible tamale with green sauce. \u00a0The flavors, the abundance of meat, I swear that it was orgasmic. \u00a0I ate 2 of them in the car in pure silence..Couldn't say a word to my husband or child until the wave passed. \u00a0I had to close my eyes and savor it.", "rating": "4", "date": [2008, 3, 24]}, "32": {"description": "Yay, for the cook who needs mexican ingredients and fresh fruits, vegetables, and perhaps the best prepared in house guacamole one could fake for their own on several occasions. \u00a0It's cheap, ready to go, and some of the best made with cilantro and lots of flavor. \u00a0Other than that, this grocery store is questionable. \u00a0Their questionable freshness of meats and dairy along with some really outdated frozen foods makes me go there when I am really hankering for some mexican food and maybe some beer - they have that too - right next to the eggs. \u00a0A warning - do not go on the first of the month, unless you are one of the masses who just got their Link reloaded. \u00a0Do not.", "rating": "3", "date": [2009, 1, 14]}, "18": {"description": "I have mixed feelings about Tony's Finer Foods. \u00a0I have gotten some awesome things in the past, like fresh tamales, steaks, and anything you could ever need to make a Mexican feast!

Google maps put it between Cicero and 90 on Montrose, but be warned that the front of the place is not directly on Montrose. You have to walk down an alley, past a yeast lab, past a costume shop, and eventually you will see the brewery's door at the end of the row, on the right hand side. Luckily, we ran into Clint while walking down Montrose and he showed us the way.I guess that most of the staff was out the day of our tour, doing tastings around the city. It was just the 4 of us, another couple on the tour, Clint, and another staff member applying beer bottle labels by hand. Yes, by hand.You can tell from the first minute you meet Clint that he loves what he does. This tour won't go into the \"how you make beer\" generic speech you get from most brewers. Instead, Clint showed us around and talked about his specific beers, the blends he makes, and his personal stories of beer-making, like when he slept in the brewery overnight, waking up every 2 hours, to check on the beer temp. That's dedication.The brewery itself is small, much smaller than I expected. All the stills are in one small-ish room, where Clint's office is in a back corner, surrounded by wine and whiskey barrels where he's aging his beer. We were taken into a connected room, which will soon house their tasting room. Our tour didn't have sampling flights (we went to Phoenix bar), because they didn't have the proper licensing. I do hope they get their tasting room up and running soon - I'd love to visit.The tour itself is free (which seems to have changed from in the past, based on other reviews), and I guarantee you'll get so much more out of it than other tours. You're basically signing on to an hour plus of having a craft beer discussion, the tour conversation going in whatever way the attendee questions take it. I enjoyed this tour way more than most other tours I've been on due to the tour's less rigid structure. That seemed to be a common sentiment, as my bro-in-law is a pretty serious home brewer, and he loved the tour as much as I, a beer novice, did.We did taste 3 beers at Phoenix, and my hands down favorite was the Mini Imperial Stout. Smooth, rich, chocolate-y and coffee-y, it was an instant hit with our group. They distribute in the city and some suburbs (Naperville and Arlington Heights were specifically mentioned), so definitely seek their beer out. I highly recommend both the tour and the beer.

Walk right in and soon your fun will begin!The fellas who started Lake Effect - Clint & Lynn - are both there for your tour to tell you all about the stories behind the brews and give you the brewmaster tour of things. Both guys are super nice & really knowledgeable about their craft. They walked us around the space, explaining things as we went. It was pretty cool because they were actually brewing while we were there. We sampled many of their beers and I found a bunch I really liked including Bitchin' Blonde which really should be my signature drink. ;) We also got to see artwork for their new labels of the Falcon Dive IPA which look are so adorable and funny. Half of the battle of a good craft brew is an awesome label, right? (I'm half kidding). We got to see them loading tons and tons of coffee until one brew and taste it when it wasn't even finished without carbonization. (Sidenoted Pro-Tip: If they let you try a non-carbonized beer and you then go on Untappd rating it unfairly because it had no carbonization, you're an idiot). \u00a0I can't say I've ever done that before so it was a cool experience.

As funny as it is to say, it's a safe space for guys. Or, it was for me.I hadn't spent much time in this part of the city, so I inched north on Cicero looking for the lodge. I was happy to discover they had their own lot. I parked, took a deep breath and walked in. The window attendant was polite, if not talkative. I paid my money. He gave me my towels, shoes and wrap. I did my homework. I was prepared -- sorta. I opened the door to the back area and... saw a cafe? Yep. They offer food and drink at the Lodge. This isn't just a place to sweat. It's a social hang out. Granted, most of the guys socializing were near nude but what's better than playing chess than being naked while playing chess?The locker area was surprisingly nice. Wooden (like, nice... not rickety) lockers with shelving, leather over-sized chairs and abundant tvs tuned to basketball, football, soccer... and Mexican soap operas. It takes all kinds. I proceeded to drop trou and put on my wrap. I'd planned on wearing my swim trunks but as I was grunted to by the very large man in the corner, \"No tuhrunks! Towel only!\" Thing is, I didn't know how to wear the thing. It's a shear white wrap about the size of an oversized washcloth with a v split. I put it on like a pair of pants... and got some friendly advice from the guy at the locker next to mine: \"Turn it to the side.\" Oh? Ohhh! Wow. I was sporting a serious wardrobe malfunction. I sort of thought that was the way I was supposed to wear it, what with so much stuff just floppin' in the breeze all around me. Properly adorned, I split my time between the wet steam and the dry sauna. Good God almighty, Eastern (and Southern) Europeans (by the languages I overheard) are hearty people. Both rooms are hot. Like, the devil is about to get you, hot. I had to wear a towel around my shoulders because my nips were getting burned. TMI (this whole review is tmi) I know, but you have to understand how hot it was. Between rooms, most guys went all Blue Lagoon and jumped in the cold pool. I wasn't 'there' so I kept my wrap on, got some water and chilled out in the chairs. I saw more than one guy knocked out in the chairs. They're comfy. They also might have been knocked out because of all the booze. Not only are these guys impervious to heat, they can drink while dehydrated. Amazing physiology! I might have been the only person drinking water (although when I requested it in Russian, I got a big smile and two bottles; what? I can speak a little Russian. I'm a renaissance man). Anywhoo, the more I drank, sat, steamed, and saunaed, I felt my stress, literally, melt away. I felt relaxed, invigorated and peaceful. I was a little apprehensive about the near-nudity thing but, trust -- no one is paying attention to you. Everyone is there to do his thing and get a relax (or business) on.

Thank you!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 10, 27]}, "11": {"description": "This is just an update to note some changes from my last review:STAFF: One of the best reasons to support the Chicago Sweatlodge is that Alex K (front desk), Serge (front desk), Jose (kitchen), Hugo (kitchen), Johnny (kitchen) and Gunther (massage therapist) are great guys. \u00a0They've all been working at CSL a good long minute and have been very consistent in their welcoming attitude toward the patrons. \u00a0 \u00a0FOOD AND BEVERAGES: Although my favorite CSL signature item remains the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, the elimination of the steak stick as an option for the borscht (beet and carrot soup) was disappointing. \u00a0It added a lot of flavor to a dish that I'd otherwise only order to feel good about choosing to laze about all day long under the pretense of \"taking care of myself.\" \u00a0So, CSL management, please bring back the borscht with steak stick, or at least add a fresh-squeezed fruit juice option to compensate for the loss of your uniquely delicious borscht. \u00a0SAUNAS: Great heat is always promised at least for part of each day in the wet and dry saunas, though for me, it's most optimal when patrons bring garlic and eucalyptus for the furnace. \u00a0As usual, summer repairs leave the wood looking gorgeous, even though the staff must struggle to ensure the patrons won't abuse it. (Read: Patrons should be advised never to climb down from the top rung of the wet sauna simultaneously. \u00a0On one occasion, two patrons did this in the right section of the wet sauna and, as the middle right bench collapsed, they flew into me.) \u00a0 \u00a0I am subtracting one star partially because I've generally given CSL's Wicker Park competitor, Red Square Spa, 4/5 star reviews despite the fact that over the years, it has provided a superior experience to Chicago Sweatlodge in two respects: The quality of the menu (gelato, lamb chops, Ginger Beer, Shirley Temples) and the demonstrated appreciation of the manager, Anton, for patrons' diversity. \u00a0So if you've only found it to be relaxing, I would recommend continuing to support Chicago Sweatlodge because the front desk (both of the Alex's and Serge), kitchen (Hugo, Johnny and Jose) and massage therapist Gunther work hard to optimize the experience of CSL for all patrons rather than focusing only on the ones who the manager \u00a0thinks will look the best on the various TV shows that have filmed segments at CSL. That brings me to the main reason why I'm updating this review: I've had some recent experiences with Chicago Sweatlodge that left me questioning whether it's still fulfilling its mission of promoting relaxation, a mission that would seem to justify my choice to patronize it for nearly 7 years and spend in excess of $10,000 there.Unfortunately, I have to report that Chicago Sweatlodge is no longer a great place for me to relax, and I've probably been in denial about that for a while. \u00a0The reason why it's not relaxing is that despite the best efforts of the guys whose work I've praised in this review, the owner and the manager (at the owner's insistence) are obsessively concerned that CSL will eventually become a place where men go to have sex with one another. \u00a0The fear of sex in Russian/Turkish baths isn't unreasonable, as businesses have historically closed or been suspended over it, but there are much healthier and more commercially sound ways to channel that fear than the owner and manager do. \u00a0 They spend a great deal of time trying to see what patrons are doing on their phones, trying to hear what they're talking about with one another, trying to observe how they interact with the massage therapists, and even confronting them about their perception that they have \"looked\" at another patron or patrons. \u00a0I have heard about several related conflicts, and on one occasion of management's paranoia at a time when I had been completely minding my own business in a room by myself, I've been drawn into such a conflict. \u00a0The accusation was that one of the other patrons believed I came to \"cruise for sex\" - which is mind-boggling considering that (weekly on average) I have arrived at and left CSL alone for nearly seven years and often have to be enticed just into sharing a table with anyone else there. \u00a0In the wake of the immediate conflict, the owner shared with me over the phone, by text and in voicemails some of his views on political, racial and sexual identity that don't make sense to disclose at length or in such vitriolic language with a patron, especially one who has been giving his business as much money as I have. Yet, in conclusion, he expressed that it would be a \"failure\" for me to stop patronizing CSL. \u00a0Although I would certainly miss the place for its virtues I've cited in this review, I know that relaxation isn't possible there with the current management strategy. \u00a0Perhaps it will be different for me in the future, and obviously it is different now for other patrons.", "rating": "2", "date": [2015, 12, 7]}, "26": {"description": "This place is the best place for dudes to relax in Chicago. Screw your man cave, the greens, or your gym- I have never felt as relaxed and rejuvenated as I do after spending an evening or afternoon here. I try to come once a month, but it usually ends up being once every couple months. Everyone is very helpful and friendly if it is your first time, and they will guide through getting set up. Basically, they give you sandals, some towels, and a locker. You strip down naked, tie on the mesh towel or the linen sheet and head to the saunas. I prefer hitting the wet sauna first, then the cold plunge, and then the dry sauna. The wet sauna is especially great because you can pour buckets of cold water on yourself, which is incredibly refreshing and helps you last longer in the heat.You can lie down, sit down, stand, naked or covered- and no one will care the least bit. I bravely got the venik scrub once, and while it may be intimidating to have your naked body completely scrubbed down in front of strangers, its surprisingly a good experience. My skin was soft for days afterwards and all my self image issues were thrown out the window. The cold plunge is pretty great too. I suggest taking off your sandals and towels before going in, as I have lost both in the pool and had to take extra time awkwardly finding/picking them up and drying them. After the cold plunge, you have a lightheaded feeling for a few minutes, which actually is pretty relaxing and great if your dry up and sit down on the leather couches afterwards and take it easy. Then you head into the dry sauna for a bit, and repeat the whole process until finished. I also got an hour long massage last night and it was great. They really go deep into the skin and muscles and relieve all that built up tension thats accumulated. All in all, this is the best place in Chicago to get naked, relax, and unwind. Screw the fancy spas. I've brought my buddies here too when they visit from out of town and everyone has had a great experience. They only things that are negative is the cramped changing space and the relatively high entrance fee ($25), but its still not unworthy of 5 stars. There's something great and old-world about walking into a hot sauna and hearing all sorts of languages and conversations. If you're not comfortable at all with male communal nudity, then this is not your type of place. But if you are, or can be somewhat, embrace the place, relax, and enjoy yourself. There are all sorts of guys here- old, young, white, brown, black, big, small, skinny, and large- and not once have I felt uncomfortable being here.

Most of my review will have comparisons to the Division Street Baths, since that used to be my hangout, but I'm not sure what's going on with them.The amenities are great. While the thin linen towels used at Division are more traditional, the velcro wrap things they have here are a nice touch. Although I had a few wardrobe malfunctions, that's to be expected. Everything is brand new, which is comforting. The lockers are good sized, but the area is a little cramped. Some ass had a 5-minute cell phone conversation right by my locker when I needed to use it. Use the cafe, dude.But, most importantly... the baths. They have Russian and Turkish, and the Russian was right up my alley. The room is a little smaller than Division, and it did get a little crowded. But I'd rather have a small room that gets damn hot than a big room that only gets pretty hot. One warning, beware of splinters on the benches. I caught one before it could do much damage, and let the staff know. The Turkish seems good if that's your thing.The cafe is nice, although a little pricey. They are not BYOB unlike the place on Division. They also don't let you bring in hookers, which the guy at Division said I could do. I'll let you weigh the pros and cons yourself.I must say the reason they only got 4 stars is the goddamn music.

If that isn't working then you simply throw a bucket of really cold water all over you. It is quite the rush and very relaxing. They also have these scrubbing leaves (forgot what they are called) which are used to exfoliate. I tried them on my back and they were cool, however I was not ready nor participated in full naked exfoliation done by one of your bania peers. That seems a little \"over the top\" for my own taste.After sitting in the banias for a while we treated ourselves to a cold plunge, which is basically taking a dip in a small pool that is probably about 34 degrees in temperature. After taking an exhilarating dip in the cold plunge I have a new found respect for those that participate in the Polar Bear race in Lake Michigan.Once finished we sat down, watched some college football on tv (they have all kinds of flat screens throughout) and ate some cabasa and perogies which were pretty good. They also serve alcohol (have a wide variety of beer and liquor) and have cards/chess which was a huge bonus. My three complaints: (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) and the fact that I don't want some \"connected\" Russian showing up on my doorstep for a bad review.1) They were playing music like Brittney Spears in the back ground which was ugh. Some classic rock or similar would of made it a better experience.2) The towel with the malfunction3) Most importantly, when I am eating cabasa I do not enjoy looking at cabasa walking around naked. They provide towels for a reason...I think people should wear them in the cafe/eating area. I can't stand old guys walking around strutting their junk in an area for eating.

And, ITS LOUD (oh, did I already mention that?), Tvs blaring in every direction, and music coming from the \"private\" training area just blazing and vibrating the whole gym. But, what are you going to do? Nothing else is around here! And, for the super low cost, it is what it is. Best idea is to go in, grab a machine, keep your ear phones in, do your stuff and get out. At least its next store to Portage Grounds, which is awesome.", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 11, 19]}, "37": {"description": "I like this xsport bec its nearby my house .

Your manager, Josh, was very kind, however he was unable to do anything for me. What type of manager has no ability to take care of things like this? It's ridiculous. When I asked why my Xit was renewing after the initial 2 months I agreed to he said that unless I request that it be canceled, in writing, it would keep renewing and that the sessions expire each month; it's a use 'em or lose 'em situation - WHICH NOBODY EVER TOLD ME!Your business and sales tactics practices are intentionally deceptive.

It was more of a fun house then anything. I REALLY hope they never do that again. AND they had food... people are trying to lose weight, and you put food in there face? Also, the staff had on sports jerseys so i couldnt even tell who was who!

I understand that they are new and are trying to get new clients but having the \"carnival\" day will not make me go and promote the gym to friends. If I wanted a DJ blasting the music, I would go to a dance club!!!The gym itself is very nice and clean. The men locker room is very clean. I wish they had a steam room. I love the machines that they have...very modern. The staff appear somewhat rude and not very friendly and far from professional. I am not asking to be greeted at the door when I walk in but at least pretend that you care and smile. If the gym wants to appreciate their customers/guests, try retraining the staff (specially the managers) on being a little more polite. Where is the customer service component? \u00a0Perhaps the staff were not required to go through any type of training. Perhaps having bad managers/supervisors brings down the moral. But come on, the gym is brand new... shouldn't the staff show excitement and be courteous to the guests? Without guests/customers, they wouldn't have a job. Overall, I am very happy that they opened as I stated before. I hope that the staff become a little more \"customer conscious\", that guests keep the gym clean, and please....no more DJs.", "rating": "3", "date": [2013, 3, 29]}, "4": {"description": "Kelly Cartwright says she will email us to resolve the issue, however never follows through.

Also, it's been around for a good minute and it's going as strong as ever. Love it. BOR is also one of the reasons to love Yelp. Without a site like Yelp, I never would have heard of BOR, much less ventured to Portage Park to partake of its sandwich-y delights... and that would have been a shame for both of us.This is old-school Chicago at it's City-of-Big-Shoulders finest. First of all, there's a parking lot -- a decent sized one. Even though you can, likely, find parking up and down this stretch of Central, the convenience of the lot (and reality that public transit in this neighborhood is a bit more difficult than others)is certainly welcome. After you've parked, walk in and take a second to peruse the menu board. You don't need that time because the options are so vast (there's a decent selection but not overwhelmingly so). You need it because it will transport you to the past: I remember coming to places like this with my dad when I was a kid... and that's a sweet memory. After taking a moment, refocus on the reason why you're here: to pig out. I went for the Italian sub with everything. For less than $6 (!), I got a yooge sub on wonderfully chewy Italian bread packed with salami, capicola, provolone cheese, pepperoni, harm, Italian dressing, lettuce, tomato, onion, green pepper, and pickles. For.less.than.$6! You can't beat that. You can't. Because the sandwich wasn't enough (it totally was), I also ordered cheese fries: crinkly fries doused in bright-yellow cheese sauce. It ain't fancy; it's just delicious. And, to top the meal off -- and I am most excited about this -- I had the option of drinking NEHI LEMONADE (NEHI!!!!! WIN!!!1!!!) but I simply could.not.resist ordering. Splice. Yes, Splice. SPLICE!!!! I FOUND AN OFF-BRAND LEMON-LIME SODA THAT'S A COMBO OF SPRITE AND SLICE! SPLICE! SPLICE!!!111!!!!

So after being lied to, insulted, & hung up on more than once by certain employees I called Walgreen's corporate # & explained the situation. What a difference! They were polite & after taking down all my info said I would hear back from someone. I was very surprised when I got a call from the pharmacy manager Peter, who was polite, apologetic, & most importantly fixed the error. I was in a car accident so playing with my medication isn't something I want to have to worry about so despite Peter's great customer service in that situation (which I called corporate to compliment him on)I never wanted to deal with that staff again. So 1-2 months later I was having a different RX transferred but it was supposed to go to the Fullerton & Central store, not Montrose & Central but somehow that's where it ended up being sent. The RX had 3 refills on it when it was sent there yet this time it said it had 0 from the get go. So after calling the old pharmacy & the nightmare Walgreens again it was supposedly figured out that I did have 3 refills on the medication. I went to pick it up & it was ready but once again the bottle said 0 refills on it. So I go through the same song & dance again with the original pharmacy & this place (where it never should have even been transferred to!) but Walgreen's didn't replace the refills they stole this time, even Peter who had been so kind & helpful after the last incident seemed to have taken on the attitude of his staff. Perhaps because I didn't call corporate first & complain this time, he didn't feel any obligation to do the right thing or even be polite or listen. What a shame.

Almost all of us took home leftovers. We were a group of six, later joined by a seventh. Our out-of-town guests had chosen this from our recommended South American cuisine options. The one large room accommodates about 20 some tables for two, which are easily grouped together for large parties. A colorful and fully stocked bar (there is a separate menu for drinks) is along one wall and faces the small performance stage and compact dance area.Our host/waiter was very attentive and helpful to us.

He was also an able photographer, taking snapshots for each table.Parking was a breeze here (no city meters, but you have to observe some posted restrictions), on street right in front or free at a lot on the corner just southeast.

Others on a bed of hominy with two fried sweet plantain slices (yummy).

She insisted that they don't have free tap water at that time and to just buy the water. I mean, at every restaurant I have ever been too I have never been charged for water. Why are they trying to get money out of the customer in every possible way? Nobody came back afterwards to check up on us. They never came back and asked if I needed a refill on my drink. They didn't come back until an hour later with my food. Finally, we received the check and were ready to leave a tip until we say that gratuity was automatically added. This is so misleading especially to customers who are used to tipping and might mistakenly leave a lot more than they are excepting or can afford. To say the least, I am never coming back here.

They must have all trained at the post office. Slow. Dumb. Not helpful. Not pleasant. Not good at any aspect of their job.

At that point I was ready to just walk away from the whole thing not paying a dime for any of it. If I thought they would have cared in the least, I might have.

Back story: As a bartender at a neighborhood joint I frequently wear many hats- therapist, technology adviser, concierge, referee and sometimes even lending institution. Through an ill advised transaction I ended up with a Sears gift card as collateral. I didn't want it initially but the amount was more than twice the small loan so what the heck right? Needless to say after a few months I ended up stuck with the card. I tried to find something from their online store. But I couldn't find a single item that I wanted... not even at half price. So I stick it in my wallet and forget until I find myself across the street at my bank with time to kill. I decide to go spend this thing. I'll kill two birds by freeing up space in my wallet and wasting a few minutes. Walking into this place was like walking into a time machine. I don't think I'd been in a Sears (department store that is... their auto centers are another story) since 1985 when I slept in the parking lot waiting for the \"Ticketron\" to open so I could score tickets for Dire Straits or some other awful show. This huge, overstaffed, poorly stocked store had the overwhelming smell of corporate bankruptcy. I mean the employee to item of merchandise ratio had to be 1 to 100. That's not good. The half full racks reminded me of grainy pictures of the pre-glastnost Russian's consumer plight. Anyway, I make my way past the embarrassingly empty shelves and chitchatting employees to the tools... nothing I need. I hit the BBQ grill area... nothing I need. After the kitchen implement section I'm 0-3. Running out of options, I end up in the men's clothing department where I find button down, short sleeved shirts on sale. $9.99? I try a few on and they fit. I'm shocked. See, I'm a little misshapen. I'm not tall enough to be a tall, not short enough to be a short. And when you wear a 50 suit jacket with my 19\" neck it's hard to a shirt that works. But it's like these shirts were tailored for the averaged heighted, thick necked man. My interior monologue screams at me \"Holy crap you're about to buy clothing from Sears!!!\" I fight through pride and shamefully walk out with five shirts that fit better than anything hanging in my closet.

There obviously are so many better Chinese food places to dine which provide the commotion and hustle one would expect at a Chinese restaurant. HKH is the antithesis of that experience. It is slow and empty and makes you wonder whether you should check out another place as soon as you walk in. The owners are often sitting in the dining room and talking or watching tv while prepping vegetables for their dishes. I still don't understand how they turn a profit, of the dozens of times I have carried out from HKH this place has never had customers. Getting the food is another story. After ordering (we have tried pretty much the entire menu), you can hear the wok getting going and food being prepared fresh (a good thing about a slow/quiet restaurant). The food is ready incredibly fast and the prices are dirt cheap. If you spend over a certain amount they toss in chicken wings as well. Quantities are plentiful but go for the extra dish so they you can get the free chicken wings. They are better than most fried chicken joints that specialize in it. My fav 3 are the mushoo pork with a side of plum sauce (solid dish, definitely has been a mainstay in our tifecta orders), mapo tofu (classic taste with a generous portion of tofu), and any chicken dish (we like the sesame or the general). Add on the 6 fried chickens and you have a feast. Great little discovery in my hood. Awesome speed in delivery service as well. If lethargic and wanting to veg by the tv.

Because they are larger it gives you the mental picture of not getting as much - but \u00a01/2 a lb is \u00a01/2 a lb, it's the same amount. The hush puppies were a bit more BUT you get quite a bit more and they are larger and they are also very good. The only complaint is that I did not like the cocktail sauce at all, it was more like BBQ sauce than a cocktail sauce. I. made my own when I got home. I am not sure if it is just a lot of Worcestershire sauce (which I do love) or what, but it it very dark in color and just tastes like BBQ sauce. \u00a0I would go here again to check out the Chicago style fried shrimp and fried cauliflower.

I grew up in Portage Park and even owned a house in the area. This was my go to place for most of my shopping. Yeah there's a Jewel across the street but their produce prices will literally cost you an arm & a leg. I never understood why people constantly shop there paying those high produce prices. I walked in here recently and walked out with 6 heavy bags of fresh food for only $20. I was most impressed with the giant bunch of fresh parsley I picked up. It is the freshest parsley I've had since growing my own garden this past summer. But my love didn't stop there as I loaded up on even more veggies. With prices this low it makes it hard to not buy the entire store. The store also has many essentials, so you could get away with all of your shopping here. The two basic ethnicities that are covered here include Mexican and Italian. Everything you need to whip up tacos is at your finger tips. And if your feeling saucy then why not make a giant pot of Sunday Gravy. They even have dried pasta if you like cooking out of a bag. What really impresses me is the great prices on lunch meats and cheeses for the last 20 years. It is almost worth the drive from downtown to stock up. We picked up a giant container of shaved Parmesan for only $3. At a big grocery store this would cost over $5. I must admit that this cheese I bought literally melts in your mouth. I should have bought two containers. If you're looking for deli meats then this is the place because the prices are fantastic. Again the larger grocery stores mark up their lunch meats so high. The deli counter also has pre made items. So if you're looking to take out the part of assembling your food, then you can just take & bake them at home. The staff behind the meat counters are really good and fast at completing your orders. They even have a small butcher here who can cut your meat or grind up anything you want. There are some pre marinated meats and again you just need to take them home to cook them up. I really miss this place and I wish I still lived closer. I am going to make more attempts to shop here when I am driving through my old neighborhood. If you find yourself in the 6 corners area, then by pass the big Jewel and visit this smaller store that will treat you right. They even have a small organic section that has great prices.

I was so excited about trying this place since it's only about a 15 minute walk from our apartment and who doesn't love brunch? I'll start with the good parts: it's decorated beautifully and the coffee is delicious. Very laid back vibe, in a good way. It seems like it'd be a nice chill place to watch a Blackhawks game at the bar. Now, for the not so great parts: I ordered the egg white omelette, without bacon. On the menu, it said it came with an English muffin, feta cheese and some veggies in the omelette itself, a cucumber salad on the side, and homemade hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend ordered an \"Eastern European skillet\" which was supposed to be meatless and have veggies in it with toast on the side. When our food arrived, it did not match the menu descriptions at all. My boyfriend even asked \"is this our food?\" Because his skillet clearly had pork in it. But he was reassured by the waiter that it was his skillet and that they \"were changing the menu around\" as an explanation for why our food might be \u00a0different than the description on the menu. \u00a0Umm ok? Seems kinda like false advertising. My boyfriend isn't a vegetarian, he just didn't feel like eating meat that morning but said he'd eat it anyways. He ended up only eating about 1/3 of it - he's not a picky eater AT ALL so it obviously just didn't taste very good. My omelette arrived sans hollandaise sauce, sans English muffin, and with potatoes instead of the cucumber salad that I was looking forward to...I didn't detect any feta cheese in my omelette either - just some caramelized onions and spinach. I didn't bother asking about my food and why it didn't match the description on the menu, but I probably should have. I'm not really a confrontational person and hate feeling like I'm being nitpicky, so I let it go. I normally love breakfast potatoes and these ones looked appealing/super crispy yet somehow managed to be completely flavorless. It was all edible but it just wasn't that great tasting. My coffee cup was empty for about 30 minutes before anyone came by to check on us and refill it, and we had to ask for my boyfriend's toast since it didn't come out with our food. The waitress apologized and brought us some very lightly toasted bread. I'm not sure if this was an issue with the wait staff being inexperienced or if the menu truly is being changed up and there was confusion in the kitchen?

The head on the beer was too big which significantly took away from the 12oz of liquid delight in the glass. This has to get better, because others will take notice. I guess the situation was a little overwhelming for the staff, because of the massive crowd that night, but no need to rush a good thing.My previous review of the bottle shop remains unchanged.

Some of their teas are bad, some of their teas are amazing, but only a handful are worth the money.My biggest quibble with Teavana is that most of their flavored tea blends are about 95% frou-frou and 5% actual tea leaves. Not only does that make the price of most teas inexcusable, but it means you wind up drinking a cup of hot fruit juice instead of a cup of tea. (These options taste better iced but why not just save your money at that point and buy juice?) The worst offender I've tried so far was the blackberry mojito green tea, whereas the better-balanced blends have been the strawberry slender pu-erh and the anjou pear-adise oolong. You can partially counteract this problem by buying one of their lower or medium-grade pure teas and blending it with the flavored selection. I like the peachberry jasmine sutra blended with additional jasmine pearls or with plain sencha jade reserve.That said, some of the pure and scented tea varietals are fantastic. The gyokuro imperial, green jasmine pearls, monkey-picked oolong, and body+mind white are exquisite. Capital of heaven keemun and the now-discontinued nine dragon golden needle are also very good. Are they worth paying up to $10/oz in some cases, though?! That I'm not so sure about, but I'm inclined to say most of the markups are excessive. So far the most comparable quality tea I've found was from Rishi Tea and I think their prices are a little bit more reasonable.Another drawback here is that the minimum quantity they sell of a given tea is 2 oz, which is a lot to commit to, especially for the pricier teas or blends of multiple teas. They offer samples of a few teas, though, and I recently discovered that they brew and sell individual cups of tea at the counter, so I recommend trying a new tea before buying to make sure you like it. Tip: the cha yen thai black tea, while decent in its own right, tastes absolutely nothing like thai tea.Finally, the employees in every Teavana store I've ever visited try to upsell and cross-sell you like CRAZY. Some of their tea accessories are worth it and some are overpriced, but the pushy salespeople will try to get you to take home everything in the store. I might have given them 3 stars otherwise but the sales experience knocks it down a peg for me.My overall impression is that a few Teavana options are worth the cost, but most are not. I'll keep sampling cups to pick out the gems, but for my \"fancy\" tea I'll mostly stick to Rishi and for my medium-grade tea I'll mostly stick to Argo Tea and Tealuxe.", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 8, 12]}, "31": {"description": "I really liked this place.

Like a bad relationship that is just not good for you, I had to finally cut ties with Teavana after many many months of being together. I used to spend hundreds a month on their teas, and I even had a great system at home of tasty hot and iced teas that I drank regularly, but it was time to go. It was difficult to do, and sometimes I will miss certain teas of theirs, but it was the best thing for me. Plus, I am MUCH happier in my relationship with Adagio Teas now. In the case of Teavana though, it wasn't me, it was them, and a lot of the problem had to do with this store.As everyone has already mentioned, one of the biggest problems with Teavana comes down to their pushy and downright rude sales tactics. Never in my life have I come across this kind of aggressiveness, not even on a used car lot. They sell their teas in 2oz portions, which is the smallest amount you can buy, and they offer a 10% discount if you purchase 16oz. They must be required to make sure everyone leaves with 16oz of tea, because they will push that discount on you over and over again, even if you are just walking it for 2oz of tea. When you say no to them, they will say things like \"you'd have to be stupid to not take the 10% discount.\" I finally told one employee one day, \"well clearly I must be stupid. Thanks!\" Also, they are very sneaky. You'll ask for 2oz of a tea, and they will put like 3.5oz in your bag and seal it up. I finally caught someone doing it one day, and called her out on it. She said she 'didn't think I would mind,' even though it was almost double what I asked for. When I told her to take it out, and only give me the 2oz I asked for, she gave me a snarky \"fine,\" and then told me not to blame her when my tea tasted terrible, because she was going to have to take out all the 'good stuff' to get my tea down to 2oz. My jaw hit the floor.As I said, I am MUCH happier with my experiences at Adagio Teas now. The employees are never pushy, and seem to be there just to help. Most importantly, the teas are as good if not better, and much cheaper. I can walk out of the door with 16oz of tea for $25, where at Teavana it would cost me $75 or more. Go to Adagio, you'll thank me later.***On a side note, I have to point out a ridiculous and lazy policy Teavana has. As many already know, you can go into Teavana and order tea 'by the cup' to go. It's nice when you need a cup of tea on the go, plus you get to sample tea that you will likely come back and buy to brew at home. Well, during the holidays Teavana tries to get rid of that, because it's 'too busy' to brew people tea. This store takes it to the next level though. Two weeks before Halloween, when there was literally no one in the mall, this store had already started the policy and told me they wouldn't be brewing tea by the cup again until January 1st. When I questioned them, because the holidays weren't even close yet and there was no one in the mall, I was told to just go to the food court because the tea is 'just as good' there. What?! When I walked out of the store, they went back to gossiping since they had no work to do. I ended up contacting corporate about my experience, and was told the employees are supposed to only say no if it is 'very busy' in the store. Clearly, they can also say no if they just don't feel like it. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, I had the same thing happen in this store around 4:30pm on a Sunday one day. I walked in and asked for a cup of tea, and the employee said they don't brew tea by the cup for the last hour they are open, so they have time to clean. When I explained to him it was 4:30pm, and they close in an hour and a half at 6:00pm, he said it was 'too bad' because he already had started cleaning. Again, clearly it's this store, because I visited the Orland Park and Skokie stores just a week or so before Christmas, with their stores packed with shoppers, and they were more than happy to brew me a cup of tea by the cup no questions asked. Seriously though, this should be basic customer service. The more people can sample, the more they will buy when they like it, especially during the holidays.", "rating": "1", "date": [2014, 2, 14]}, "11": {"description": "Pay attention to the prices!!

I am certain that the tea will stay alive for the next 30 minutes, until I can get home and put it in a pillow-lined tin.

Thank you Antionet.I read the reviews before I went in so I knew it could get expensive. I did not plan to get much. The smell of the tea's and amazing customer service are what got me. The plus side about this tea's, which was shared with me is, they can be steeped more than once. I have put that theory to test this morning and sure enough you can. I was told between 3 to 5x depending on the tea. I have used the same leaves twice so far with amazing flavor each time. Try doing that with you everyday grocery brand. I think the amount of times you can steep the leaves makes up for the price. I am a fan!!!!I got 3 very delicious flavors Strawberry Paraiso, Limeade twist, and Sakura Allure.

What kind of place calls themselves \"Scoops\" but doesn't have an ice cream selection? My friend and I held a table outside while the rest of our party ordered the ice cream. Scoops was packed and were jazzed for some ice cream! The tables outside were FILTHY!!! This was the grand opening. They were absolutely disgusting. And I don't mean a little ketchup either. I mean pieces of food, DIRT, salad dressing! There's no way this furniture was new either. It was gross. I was pretty disappointed when the rest of our party joined us to tell us the bad news, Scoops only has vanilla ice cream and 2 toppings options: strawberry or chocolate sauce for a sundae. I requested a strawberry sundae. 10 minutes later the rest of our party comes back outside to tell us we're leaving. Scoops didn't have strawberry topping on their grand opening. Okaaaaay. We left very annoyed. No ice cream and nasty tables. Visit #2: Let's try the food! My husband and I got some greasy staples. He had a hot dog with cheese fries and I had cheese sticks. The food was ok. Nothing to get excited about. What didn't make me happy was finding a piece of chicken (nugget?) in my bag of cheese sticks or finding a chunk of ground beef in my husband's cheese dip for his fries. I'm a vegetarian - both \"surprises\" disgusted me. And again, FILTHY tables inside. Napkins, food and general crap all over the tables and floors. Nobody was in there except one other party.

I asked for a grilled chicken breast sandwich, and that part of the order process went fine. Things derailed, however, when I attempted to order rice pilaf, as identified on the menu. \u00a0The woman taking my order looked puzzled, and said, \"I don't think we have that\".

Pointing, \u00a0I said,\"But it's right there on the menu.\" \u00a0She then lackadaisically swiveled her head in a fruitless effort to peer at the menu at which I was pointing, and arrived at the conclusion that she couldn't actually read the menu from her vantage point, which was to her the only investigation this situation required.

Uncertain as how to proceed from there, or what the rationalization was for running out of what seemed to be a core menu item, I then pitched the only scenario for which I could conceive logically arriving at this conclusion: \"So, you're out of it, today?\" The young woman latched on to this with a visible look of relief and, nodding her head, said,\"Yes, we're out of it today.\" Not really satisfied with this answer, I concluded my order and paid, after which I sat down on one of the convenient chairs placed neatly in a row opposite the counter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A few moments later she called an order number and a man came up to the counter to get his order (the aforementioned Half Greek Chicken Plate), in the middle of which was a steaming mound of rice pilaf. An older woman appeared at the counter beside the younger one, and I caught her attention. I said, \"Excuse me, what was with the chicken on that man's plate?\" She curiously replied,\"Rice Pilaf.\" I asked,\"So you have Rice Pilaf?\" She confirmed that they did. I then asked,\"Then why was I just told that you don't have any?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The older woman looked at the younger woman and they hastily exchanged words.

A \u00a0telephone rang and the older woman produced and answered a cordless handset, disappearing through \u00a0a door somewhere towards the back left, leaving me alone with the young woman. Twenty minutes had now passed from the time of my initial order. I briefly started to entertain a scenario that would allow me to order some rice pilaf when the young woman called out my order, extending her hand with a bag that contained among other things a foil wrapped chicken breast sandwich. As I took the bag from her hand, she said,\"Ooooh, you wanted rice. You threw me off with 'Rice Pilaf'.\" \u00a0She spread her hands as if to communicate that \u00a0she was perfectly justified in her puzzlement.

Just when I thought Utopia couldn't get any better they surprise me with even more great hospitality, atmosphere, products and service. Utopia often has \"Cigar Parties\" that they host in their shop. It is a chance to meet the reps for the different cigar brands, learn about cigars coming out and other things, but most of all, you get to spend some time with great people and get some great deals on products. They even have raffles and food and drinks. Last week, my buddies and I went in to hang out and we each walked out with a box of cigars and a bunch of products. We bought two boxes of cigars, one was an above average box. We also bought lighters, raffle tickets, where we one an ashtray, and my buddy bought his first high quality humidor. We were given great deals on everything and I am convinced that you can not get a better deal anywhere else. Every time I buy something here I walk away with no regrets and I feel confident that I received the best price and the best products. Kevin has even helped me find products that I could not find anywhere else, and for cheaper prices than I had expected. \u00a0 We can't stop coming back to Utopia. We are there every week now. The more I go, the more I am impressed. The regulars that frequent the place are a great group of guys. Something that I really noticed the other day is that no matter what time of day or night, there are all kinds of people that come in there. Int he few hours that we were there, I seen all kinds of men and women coming in of all ages. There were regular blue collar workers, white collar workers, college students, retired men, cops and all kinds of people. there is a very diverse group of customers and regulars and everybody loves this place! My friends and i have come a long way on cigars and knowledge of them and we owe it all to Utopia Cigars and their owner Kevin. We get weekly e-mails telling us about specials and new products and we have very high quality stuff. the knowledge and help that Kevin has always given us is priceless. He is our go-to cigar man.

They used to be about the size of a quarter and 8-12 per pound, light and succulent. Then they changed over to ones the size of a dime and they are not very good at all, frozen and rubbery.

The exterior is a crispy crust with a tender interior bursting with ubiquitous flavor. Five-stars for these nuggets. \u00a0Everything here is made to order, so you know that you are getting super fresh food. This is a non-pretentious fish market. It is NOT a restaurant. You walk in, order, pay and leave. We have also tried their catfish strips and clam chowder soup. Wow, it is the best clam chowder soup we have ever had (and we have had tons of clam chowder soup all over the USA and Europe), but this is definitely \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" For this reason, I am rating the clam chowder soup with 5-stars. Their crispy fish-filet sandwich at $4 is a major bargain! It is also a good size sandwich served on a fresh bun with their home made tartar sauce. 4-stars for this $4 sandwich. Service is hospitable, kind and the owners (at least one of them) will always be at the business/store. They truly care about their products as well as the customer. They have a parking lot, so you don't have to worry about \"Pay to Park\" when you come here. You can always eat your food in your car or take it to go and enjoy at your home. Either way, you are in for a feast of a treat. This place is a Chicago institution and I highly recommend it for their variety of fresh, quality fish and other seafood delicacies. If you enjoy scallops you definitely have to try their scallops. At $16 (unheard of at any fine seafood Chicago restaurant) you will be amazed at how huge and tender these scallops are and, best of all, they do not have a fishy taste. The scallops here are ethereal. \u00a0TIP: They don't just smoke fish here. Bring your Thanksgiving turkey here and they will smoke it for you. Pure awesomeness!This is a very clean joint started decades ago. You can almost visualize the nostalgia from the \"old\" days the moment you walk inside. It is now owned by the grandchildren of the man who started Hagen's Fish Market in 1946. It is a mom and pop operation with friendly service. For the most part, their price-point is reasonable and your experience here will be a positive one. They also added some delicious new recipes which have become long-standing staples for their customers. For example, Charlene's Crab Dip is outstanding and a \"must\" try! Some of their fresh fish is delivered weekly from the east coast as well as from Hawaii and Florida. I also like that they create party trays with high quality morsels of fresh seafood. Last Summer, we ordered their shrimp party tray and it was a huge hit with our guests.This fish market is in the Jefferson Park neighborhood of Chicago. It is a stand-alone business in the middle of a residential neighborhood. A very strange location for this place, but it works for the owners. They appreciate their customers and it shows. I appreciate that they appreciate their customers, so my final rating is 4-stars. The only negative is that you cannot eat inside this place (a disappointment if you live a distance away from here).

Two weeks before the wedding we realize that our guest amount will be more around 175 (guess people don't like us). So we go to Chris and ask him if there is something we can work out as we are 25 people short of our minimum. I wasn't asking for him to give up all the money he would be missing out on, I was thinking more of maybe adding a few trays extra of appetizers, or something to offset the costs. This is something almost any caterer will do in this situation. Chris flat out said he couldn't. He gave us the run around saying that if his costs went up that he wouldn't charge us extra money and theres alot of extra things involved in adding in an appetizer other than just the food costs and blah blah blah. We were really asking him to make less of the expensive food (the chicken) and just throw in a few cheap appetizers.. (Meat balls or chicken skewers or something). But he wouldn't but he did say he would throw in some kids dinners for free (something he had said previously that he would include anyways). So, I didn't complain too much because he had every right to do what he did and stick to the contract we had signed, but still kinda annoyed me that we wouldn't budge at all on it.

My name was on the contract and the checks.We called off the wedding about 5 days before the second deposit was due, and I let Chris know immediately that we would be cancelling our contract. Since we had five days to go before the second deposit was due, I thought I would be entitled to a refund of the $2,500 deposit, since it would not be due for another several days. I explained this in an email and Chris replied he would get back to me.Over the next month or two, I emailed Chris twice more asking for a refund and explaining my thoughts on the matter, with no response until the final email where I voiced extreme displeasure with not only not getting a refund, but with his lack of regard for business ethics or common decency.Chris finally responded to me and told me he would not be issuing a refund and that he had discussed the issue with my former fiance, and he was under the impression that it had all been settled. I don't blame her for not knowing the situation, since we were no longer talking.Chris, on the other hand, had received 3 emails from me, all of them explaining my views on the matter. My name was also on the contract and the checks. It is unethical to ignore a former clients emails and discuss my money behind my back with someone whose name was not on the checks and contract.This is the reason for the one star (I wish it could be zero) review. Not only was I not issued a refund for my deposit, I was never explained why this never happened. Chris also ignored my emails for months and discussed the issue with someone else.I am sure he puts on a great party and his food tastes great, and I hope no one has to cancel a contract with him, but this was based on my experience with him, and I have nothing but bad things to say about my experience.

We went with a few different items that were tailored for the season- passed appetizers: \u00a0spaghetti squash mini cakes, ahi tuna tacos, cheese and red grape lollipops; dinner stations: grilled beef tenderloin skewers (amazing!), ravioli, fresh vegetables, grilled flatbread, French style Coq Au Vin (amazing!) red smashed potatoes and \u00a0seasonal salad. Late night they brought out mini gourmet grill cheese and pulled pork sliders! The food was absolutely to die for! \u00a0I've had a number of people who have inquired about the caterer and raved about their food! Our guests were very happy and left feeling very satisfied. \u00a0Chris was very honest and up front with us on what he thought would work and not work. Chris and Natalie also went to great lengths to help us with our sweet table and set up for the sweet table as we brought in mini cupcakes, small individual cakes, etc. \u00a0I had concerns that the wait staff wouldn't \u00a0clear the tables and plates as quickly as I heard others discuss however, this was never a problem. Their waitstaff was efficient, professional and I barely noticed them! \u00a0Just when you think the wedding is over.... they collected the few sweets that were left over, the left over liquor, and packaged up the top of our cake for us-allowing us to pick this up from them at our convenience. \u00a0 I cannot compliment this amazing team enough! \u00a0If you are looking for personal attention, amazing service, excellent food and a professional team of caterers- Chris and Natalie Constantine from D'Absolute Catering are hands down, the best!", "rating": "5", "date": [2013, 6, 6]}, "46": {"description": "D'absolute catered our wedding in September of this year.

Well, a lot of other caterers in Chicago had a problem with that. The minute we met Chris we knew we found our guy. Not only was he completely on board with everything we needed, but he had so many great suggestions. The day of, Natalie (part of the team) acted as our day of coordinator. She was fantastic! Our dinner was buffet style and I was worried about 220 guests getting fed within 45 minutes. The D'absolute crew, had it down and all my guests were eating within half an hour.. no long crazy lines. I was amazed. Food was great too, not the typical flavorless buffet food, our guests were very satisfied. Chris even helped us put a liquor list together and had his bartenders serve it.

D'absolute Catering had so many rave reviews on Yelp that I wanted to give them a try.On the contract, I specifically said that the food had to be set up by 5:00 PM for a 5:30 corporate meeting start. By 4:30 the food had already not arrived and I was worried. Bottom line is the food was not completely ready to go until 5:45. The guys setting up were busting their asses to get it set up though, which I appreciated.Being MLK Day, the building's dock closed early and held up the guys for about half an hour, but if the owner had dispatched the crew to set up the food at the appropriate time with time to spare instead of waiting until the last minute because of the \"cold temperatures that would make the food cold,\" then we would have had time to work around the building closing the dock unexpectedly. I think the owner or the crew should have done more to get around the dock being closed, or should have gone to the front to talk to security instead of waiting downstairs for 30 minutes for something to happen. While I'm setting up for my event, I don't have the time to worry about whether or not the dock is open or how the food will get up--- that's the responsibility of the catering company. What I expect from catering companies that I use is the foresight to overcome unexpected obstacles so that everything is set up on time, as specified on the contract.If you're looking for a reliable catering company, best to go with another company.

I got so many compliments about the food and cake and decorations and staffs. Usually, wedding food is not so great, cold, but the food from D'absolute was delicious and warm! At the beginning of the planning, I was just looking for a caterer that has the lowest price to save money. As you know, wedding could be very expensive and I wanted to save every dime. However, after many calls and tastings with different caterers, I realized that the most important thing was that I had to be able to trust the vendor. I wanted someone who can trust that they can do the job and I don't have to worry about it at the wedding day since I had thousand things going on wedding day. Chris from D'absolute was that person. Chris is very much experienced and knows what he's doing. He was flexible on the menu and guest counts as well. He also got us a beautiful wedding cake as we requested except the cake did not have all the flavors we asked. We asked each cake layer to have different flavors but the final cake only had two flavors.I felt like I was well taken care of during the wedding and reception. He appointed a wait staff to the bride and groom so that we are not left out during the cocktail hour and reception and etc. Usually, the bride and groom do not even get to taste much food and drinks since they are too busy greeting the guests and taking pictures, but we had our dedicated person to make sure we have our food between the formal picture and reception and cocktail hour, etc..Now I know that the caterer is a big part of the wedding.

His associate Mena never conveyed this issue to me in our correspondence so I was prepared to come to a tasting alone and it seemed as though they had availability during the day on weekdays. Yesterday Chris told that we would have to wait until October.I have now spoken to Chris twice over the phone and he keeps emphasizing the point that these tastings cost him $300-$400 so he does not like to do them unless there is a likelihood of a good outcome. This last time I spoke to him he conveyed the message that he basically does not want to work with me because he thinks I have already found the caterer that I want. Chris, if that were true, I would not be wasting my time talking to you and corresponding with your associates. I was interested in you because your work seems to be really good and I wanted to see if your food was the best of the companies from which we have to choose. I can't make that decision from looking at descriptions and pictures. I was looking forward to experiencing what the positive reviews are saying. But I have come to understand that I am not welcome at your house. Perhaps it is all a misunderstanding, perhaps I am just not your kind of client.

We had visited several other caterers, including some who would be considered more high-end, but after a few cold main courses and one bout of sudden illness, we stepped into D'absolute's tasting room and knew instantly they were the best choice for our wedding.

Chris instantly jumped in to help, being my main source for info on where to look and who to contact, and maybe even acting as a therapist during the tougher times...He contacted people for us, negotiated for us, and changed the ENTIRE plan around just a mere 5 weeks before the wedding. He took meetings and phone calls at all hours of the day (and night). He was brutally honest when he needed to be, and saved me from making an epically terrible venue decision based on pure exhaustion.

I also went with a late night food option through Chris and it was a HUGE hit to sober up everyone at the end of the night. The custom signature drinks were a winner too!

He listened and understood our vision, helped us refine it when necessary, and wasn't afraid to tell us when we were heading down a path that wouldn't work.Once we signed the contract we worked directly with Nathalie who was amazing! Just like Chris she helped us mold our vision into a really cool experience for us and our guests including a beer tasting during cocktails and some late night Chicago dogs and mini grilled cheese sandwiches. She was easy to work with and each time my husband and I met with her we'd walk away talking about how happy we were that we picked D'Absolute and Nathalie would be doing this with us. While I had done a number of corporate events, I'd never done a wedding. And Nathalie did a great job guiding us when necessary. When it came to the actual wedding, D'Absolute and Nathalie nailed it! Set up was done ahead of time, the food was excellent, they made sure we had drinks and food at all times, worked with all the vendors to make sure it was seamless and went with the flow when the schedule changed on the fly.

I headed toward the back of the store, where all the frozen yogurt was. I was disappointed to see there were no taster cups. My friend told me she was sure they had them (she had been there before), but there was such a long line to wait in that I just decided to pick some flavors I thought I'd like for my cup. The selection isn't as huge as at the chain fro yo shops, but with about 10 choices, that was more than enough for me. I ended up with the strawberry and berry tart flavors.Next came the toppings. I was impressed with the wide variety of options, again, because this isn't a chain store. I went on the light end with toppings, choosing only peach boba, mochi, and my absolute favorite - marshmallow fluff topping. Not even all the big shops have marshmallow topping, so Josi's gets an extra star from \u00a0me for that. Really, the only topping I usually get that they didn't have was Captain Crunch cereal. I know, it's weird, but it's so good.We didn't wait in line to pay for too long. Even though the line was long, it went by quickly. At the end, my yogurt ended up costing just north of $2! What a deal!We ended up staying there to eat our treat. That's when I really had a chance to look around the place. First of all, there's a dressed skeleton at one of the front tables by the window. He was wearing Blackhawks garb. Cute. There were board games and a ton of items for kids to play with. There was even a bunch of paper pieces set out that customers were encouraged to \"write an idea\" on. Then, hundreds were hung on the wall. The ideas I saw ranged from \"I love ice cream\" to \"I hate pink\" to \"Go Hawks!\" very cute idea. There was a machine that let you purchase $0.50 poems from a local poet, and there was even a container set out that collected food to donate. Needless to say, the place had a great vibe.As we left, the woman working who I assume was the owner thanked us for coming in and told us to have a great day.

Also, I'm a little concerned about it once the weather gets cold, because they don't have much at all besides frozen yogurt. You can get a regular coffee or iced tea, but that's it.

Heck, it makes the mediocre pancake dish I got at Elly's Jeff Park almost good in comparison.If it wasn't for the fact my friends infrequently come here and that I sometimes go along to give them company, I'd never come back. Honestly if you're don't know the diners out on this part of town well, I'd suggest going to Lucky Grill instead. Heck, I have an odd feeling you might have a better experience going to Big Top(open 24/7 IIRC, and at least is open just as late if they now only do 24 hours on weekends by some chance), or A's instead(northeast corner of Irving/Naragansett, and too bad it doesn't stay open past 5pm).

So he immediately goes off, saying \"I don't go to your job and expect it to be free!!\" \u00a0I tell him I can comeback tomorrow to pay the rest and he's still upset so finally he was like \"ok\" assuming I would I never come back, and I left. \u00a0 I'n my car now, like damn that was an expensive cut. \u00a0But i'm not a dead beat so I'm gonna come back and pay what I owe. \u00a0Then I had remorse about doing that because of how rude he was and called the barbershop and told Jesse the owner I won't pay the rest because I was treated rudely by Rhett. \u00a0He was apologetic for the misunderstanding and listened to my complaints so I figured Ill comeback and payup because he was being respectful and I just don't like owing people money. \u00a0I came back the next day and Jesse said it was ok on the rest and gave me his card if I ever want to comeback to make an appointment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moral of the story don't assume anything! 1.

You idly wonder about the whereabouts of Teresa 1 as you walk in, shaking the rain from your umbrella. The time-yellowed wallpaper strikes you first, working in concert with the amber resin of the equally aged tables and the dim lighting to make you wonder briefly if what you thought was a restaurant is in fact an antique photograph. It's not quite dinner time, and the room is empty save for a single diner seated alone at a table near the door. She does not look up as you enter. No one stands behind the counter, so you warily find a seat at a table in the corner.  You look at your watch - 5:28, and no where to be until 8:00. Just as you are about to reconsider your choice a woman toddles from the back room. She is as aged as the decor, and has an unconcerned, grandmotherly demeanor. She does not speak to you, merely glancing in your direction as she delivers a plate of some unidentifiable stew to the other patron. You open your mouth to alert her to your presence, but no sound escapes. Several minutes pass in silence, and a menu appears in front of you. There is a photograph on the front, perhaps the same photograph you stepped into when you entered the restaurant. The woman in the photograph might well be the waitress some 30 or 40 years before, and might well be named Teresa. All the same, she might well not be. You have ample time to consider this as you wait for who you have decided to now call Teresa to return to take your order. You read the menu aloud, your tongue stumbling over familiar letters arranged in unfamiliar patterns and combinations. The Polish items have English translations, but you have no basis to judge their validity. The other patron hears your struggles and offers advice. \"The cheek meat from a roasted pig's head is tender and delicious\", she says. You thank her for her input and decide on the beef with horseradish. You look at your watch. Time must be passing, surely. Teresa ambles over to your table, stopping on the way to snatch a napkin from a stack nearby. It is on this that she writes your order. \"Oh, we no have,\" she tells you upon hearing your decision, \"I give you goulash instead.\" Too taken aback to argue, you inquire about the side options, asking if you can have mashed as your Choice of Potato. \"Boiled,\" she replies, before moving back into the kitchen.  You look at your watch again. Is it still working? Why didn't you spring for the model with a second hand? You try to calm yourself by looking around at the decor you had not yet had time to let your eyes settle on. The liquor cabinet has no door, and the bottles within are obscured by dust and written in a language you do not comprehend. There is a soda fountain in one corner. 'UpTown'? That's not a real brand. You decide not to order any drinks beyond the pitcher of water placed on your table. The meal arrives, and your fears and concerns are wiped away in a fog of savoury smells punctuated by simple spices. A salt shaker stands alone on your table, but you do not even consider it. You've eaten traditional Polish cuisine before many times, and this was as good or better. There is even an unexpected gift of a potato pancake which Teresa delivers in silence. You finish your meal quickly, famished not only from the journey you've undertaken to arrive here but also from the time since you sat down. You look at your watch, and then remove it and put it in your pocket in disgust.  You catch Teresa's eye as she is replacing your water pitcher and ask for your cheque. There is neither recognition nor acknowledgement of your request, but in due time it arrives nevertheless. In the time between you asking and it returning, other patrons have stumbled in from the rain. You do not look up as they enter. As Teresa drops off the bill, she delivers menus to the newcomers. Their mouths roll over the syllables haltingly. You smile. Leaving cash on the table to cover your due, both to avoid having to summon Teresa once more and because you are uncertain Visa is accepted in the foreign country this restaurant seems to occupy, you stand and put on your coat. Steeling your nerves, you stride toward the door, fighting through clouds of unnatural urges to sit and eat some more and to simply never leave. You break through, cross the threshold, and a flash of sunlight tells you that the rain has finally ended. You look at your wrist. It does not inform you of the time, and you sheepishly fish out your watch from your pocket. 7:02. You head down the street to your show. As you reach the corner, you look back at Teresa 2 and are shocked to find that there is no restaurant behind you. Only a vacant lot, containing charred timbers and a slagged plastic awning reading \"Teresa - Fine Polish Food\". You blink, and look around you at the city skyline. It is unfamiliar. You see a newspaper in the gutter and scramble to pick it up.

Yep, they offer a variety of salad. I specifically asked the girl if their chopped salad comes with bacon (cause most do). I wanted to make sure I got it without it if they did since I didn't eat red meat at the time. She said it doesn't and that it came with lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, and dressing. Hmm, never had cucumber in a chopped salad...but sounds alll good to me!And whaddaya know, i get a big 'ol pile of bacon on top of a bed of lettuce. -_- I figured she was new and just made a mistake which I'd understand (I've worked at a restaurant for years) so I was patient with her...up until she started being unbelievably rude to me for no reason at all. When I told her again I didn't want meat, she was completely unapologetic, rolled her eyes, and after she literally yanked the box of salad out of my hand, the girl rudely goes, \"Ok, so what do you want?

My boyfriend tells her how she just handed me the receipt a minute ago when I paid for it, and I left it on the counter (cause I didn't think that I'd be needing it) and he saw her throw it out. She says, \"I still can't give you your money back without a receipt or my register will be short.\" What? How is your register being short my problem at all? \u00a0What do you possibly want me to say to this? Go find my receipt in the garbage you threw it out in or look up the last order/receipt through the computer like any person with common sense would??

From ordering to making the turnaround is fast - it seems that he only takes one order at a time, prepares it, you pay. Then, and only then, does he service the next customer.

Unfortunately, we didn't figure this out until after we left, but our first clue should have been having enough money to leave a 70% tip.

When she got there, she didn't seem all that friendly, either. We both ordered chicken fajitas, one with no tomato or cheese. When she brought out one order, we figured that just meant the other was being cooked separately to accommodate the request... finally, after 5-10 minutes waiting for the second one to come out, we asked her how much longer it would be (since we were going to the Silent Film Society's presentation of Phantom of the Opera, and didn't want to be late). She was surprised that we had two orders. Was she not listening when we ordered the first time?... it was very specific! If we had ordered just the one without tomato and cheese, it would have been wrong anyway since mine came that way. One other thing to note, which probably isn't a big deal to many people but should be mentioned, is that they don't have flour tortillas. She brought out corn ones and since I don't like the corn ones, I asked for flour. No dice.I ordered a cheese quesadilla as an appetizer since it was so cheap. I didn't expect it to come out with the fajitas instead of before, but no big deal. What was a little more bothersome was that the cheese in the center wasn't fully melted (you could still see shredded cheese in the center, instead of the gooey mess of cheesy goodness it should be), and honestly it was cold. I guess that's why it's an appetizer, to be brought out before the rest of the food is cooked.When the second entree was brought out, we asked for the check since we noticed it was taking several minutes for the other table (still only the two parties) to get theirs. Ten minutes or so later, when she was busing the other table... we asked again, since she hadn't brought it to us. I guess it was a good thing we didn't just leave our cash, because she overcharged us. She brought us a check that had what we ordered on it, but no prices; I had figured out the total in my head based upon what we ordered (two orders of fajitas, a cheese quesadilla and a can of pop that I wouldn't have ordered if I'd known it was in a can), and according to what the prices were on their menu, it should have been about $20.

I can't believe that I have been going to No Chip Queen for over a year already! I still think that Felicia is the best in town! She is always super clean, professional, and does the very best no chip mani this side of the Mississippi. As for the lady who reviewed her below, I already contacted Yelp letting them know that she has written a false review. I happened to be at the salon the day that this all happened, and her entire review is pretty much a lie. The truth is that Felicia is one of the most professional people that I have ever met, and I only wish that every business was run the way that hers is. With all of the competition out there, it says something that I've stuck with NCQ for over a year, and the service has never been an ounce less than stellar. NCQ is the only place to go for a no chip service if you want meticulous work done for a (STILL!) great price! If only Felicia knew what a commodity she is, she could charge twice what she does and get it easily, but if you don't tell her, neither will I!", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 7, 21]}, "44": {"description": "Felicia the No Chip Queen is FABULOUS! \u00a0I've been getting no chip manicures for over a year and I needed to find somewhere closer to home to get my nails done. \u00a0I found No Chip Queen and am so happy with the great quality of the products and the personalized service!She offers a great price for a no chip manicure and it lasts for at least two weeks!", "rating": "5", "date": [2011, 9, 26]}, "24": {"description": "A bit shout out to Felicia for what was easily the best no-chip ever! 4 weeks after her having done my nails with no-chip, the polish was still intact; she even has pictures of it on facebook if you need proof.

Add to that the fact that I cook a lot and do quite a bit work around the house, so that says a lot about how 'sturdy' the application is.When I went back, I got a regular pedi as well and Felicia was just as good with it.

If you look it up on the Internet the Biosculpt products she uses are the best there can be: no acrylic, no junk, nothing that will turn your otherwise healthy nails into yellow dried stumps. Props on that- I love my nails and had them damaged by thoughtless technicians who hid the reality of the product they used from me before, so this is a welcome change. What I absolutely love is that she does not force you to wear the nails all year round and admits that your naturals have to breathe every now and then no matter how good the product is. Now that is honesty, and not being driven by profit at the expense of someone's health. Again, love that. She also does not file the surface of the nail before polish application and that is something I appreciate.Moving on: application takes some time but the result is as awesome and clean as possible. The color is perfectly even, you can't see any streaks (I've had this happen with a no-chip manicures at other places I've been to). Removal is also a painless process, as she puts solution-soaked pieces of cotton on your nails and wraps them up to melt the polish. No dipping your hands into acetone that's being heated from below. No dry fingers afterwards, no fumes, no headache. It may take a few minutes longer than an acetone bath, but I'd take this over the nightmare of a soak nail removal any day. The choice of colors is more than enough, and she's constantly adding new ones in. You can find a color to match any occasion (this was one of the issues with other places for me- they had maybe 10 colors, 5 of which were different shades of pink- how often do they expect me to wear the same color, I like to change it up every time I come in). So there, that's covered.The cost is as reasonable as it gets. It's actually less than any other place I've ever been to and it's twice as better here, so that's a win right there if I've ever seen one.Last but not least- the quality of the actual manicure. Adding to what I've already said about it being flawless and all, it really lasts. No peeling. None. None from the bottom, none from the sides (again, I've had this happen when I went elsewhere). I know it's supposed to last two weeks, but I can proudly show my nails to anyone at the end of week three and gloat about how awesome they are holding up all this time. If it wasn't for the grow-out, you wouldn't be able to tell.If you're going anywhere else to get your no chip manicure done, you might as well just go ahead and say it out loud: you don't care if your nails will hate you afterwards. Seriously, go visit Felicia- your nails will feel the love. P.S.I usually don't care much about what others write in their reviews but this one caught my eye. There is one clearly unhinged person, who left a review about the salon not calling her to confirm her appointment and ripping the cool nail lady a new one without ever seeing her face to face.Lady!It's not the dentist, and it's not a colonoscopy. I've had my nails done in a few different countries on two continents, and nobody, no matter how fancy the salon was, ever called me to confirm an appointment. Places wh9ch do nails and hair usually do not do that, because how hard is it to put down a date in your calendar? Dentists and doctors do that because they stand to lose hundreds or thousands from your missed visits, and nail artist and hairdressers usually do not.

But after learning that if the wrong person removes your polish, that it would involve scraping, leaving your nail damaged and weak. So I decided to search for a nail tech that knows what she is doing. I found No Chip Queen through Yelp and trusted all the great reviews she had. She removed my polish gently with no damage to my nails. Whew!Felicia gave me a no chip manicure and pedicure right before I left for my vacation to Italy. It withstood 10 days of sandal wearing, non-stop walking on cobblestone roads and rocky trails, several stubbed toes, countless times of packing and unpacking, and rummaging through my bag every other minute to find and assemble my camera gear. In fact, it lasted 4 weeks (work got the best of me after my vacation and a part of me wanted to see how long this would really last). The nail polish looked as smooth and shiny as it did the first day it was applied. If it wasn't for nail growth, this manicure would have lasted quite a long time. I've gotten a regular mani+pedi from Felicia, too. She really is detail oriented. A perfectionist, even. My cuticles are neat, my nail bed is smooth, the shape is perfectly round, and the polish is shiny!Most importantly, she offers something no one else does - a very sanitary experience. Ever wonder how many times that pumice stone at your local nail salon has been used. Who it was used on before you? If it has ever been cleaned. Or if they ever clean the water jets in the foot bath?

First and foremost, I live in the South Loop and drive a good 20-30 minutes for Felicia's services. \u00a0Felicia ALWAYS makes an attempt to fit me into her schedule. \u00a0In fact, Felicia has taken me at late as 7:30-8:00ish before due to my hectic schedule. \u00a0That is just one example of how dedicated Felicia is to her work and her clients.Secondly, Felicia's work speaks for itself and she stands behind it. \u00a0That is hard to find these days and that is what I really appreciate about her services. \u00a0I have never felt rushed and that is definitely something I experienced frequently before finding NCQ. \u00a0Felicia takes her time and pays attention to the small details, that is why I always leave looking and feeling like a million bucks. Third, Felicia is the epitome of a professional. \u00a0She usually books her appointments via text which is nice because she isn't constantly interrupting my services to book clients. \u00a0Another thing I really appreciate is that Felicia goes above and beyond by making sure everything is sanitized and that her clients are comfortable. \u00a0I've never observed Felicia wearing a coat, and in fact, she has always checked in with me in regards to my comfort level of the temperature in the salon. \u00a0She has only explained her rationale behind using new buffers and files for each client and introduced the concept of the pedicure chair she uses at my first appointment. \u00a0After that, I never heard about why she does things the way she does, but I continue to observe her pull out a new liner for my pedicure every two weeks in addition to pull out a fresh file and buffer for my services. \u00a0While to some, this consideration may be overlooked, it is greatly appreciated by me. \u00a0I pride myself on having beautiful nails and toes and I am glad Felicia keeps me looking beautiful and healthy at the same time.

WOW, there must've been a 100 of colors, i felt like i was at the Home Depot paint department. And guess what - she always has new colors!

It was a delicious burger that could get in the ring with Kumas or Owen and Engine, etc...Much to our surprise, after our meal, Hannah came walking out with a pumpkin, blonde brownie with a carmel apple sauce, as a thank you for our business!! None of this seemed out of the ordinary for Knife and Tine. What a great day spent meeting new friends and enjoying a great meal.Hannah encouraged us to come back and see her..

We were seated at waited on by one of the partners Mike.We were in no hurry so with the help of Mike we worked our way through the menu. We began with the crab cakes which set the tone for our lunch. The crab cakes were light and the seasoning was perfect. Next we tried the Beet and Burrata appetizer. Again we were impressed not just with the food but also the presentation. The next dish that we shared was the Shrimp and Grits. This was not my grandfather's grits. The white grits were very creamy more resembling a risotto. The Shrimp and Grits \u00a0had just the right combination of seasonings to make this simply delicious! We finished with the apple pie that was accompanied with whipped cream, caramel sauce and a cream cheese butter.

The Restaurant Week menu was a joke as you actually end up paying more by selecting from the menu versus ordering a la carte. Needless to say, we didn't order from the Restaurant Week menu.

Not sure if the bartender was in training, but by the time we got our drinks they were half empty from what seemed like the entire staff taste-testing the drinks. The cocktails themselves were sub-par at best. I switched to wine after one drink, figuring they couldn't mess that up. The wine was the best part of my meal (but for the price of a glass of wine, they could be a little more generous with the pour). Onto the food. It was HORRIBLE! \u00a0All of it. Lobster bisque was okay, but no actual lobster. I ordered the beer can chicken with dumplings and my friends both got the fried chicken. All AWFUL. I ate the dumplings because I would still have to pay for the meal. The broth of the entree was one of the most horrible things I've ever tasted. My friends ate few bites of the fried chicken and were done. KFC has better fried chicken and at a fraction of the price. \u00a0My husband is a Caesar salad fanatic and was highly disappointed in the bland salad. We also ordered the Mac and cheese - how can Mac and cheese not be delicious?! They even messed this up. It was spaghetti noodles with a sauce that tasted like nothing I ever want to experience again. When my husband doesn't scarf down Mac and cheese, you know it's very bad. By the end of the meal, we didn't even want to try dessert and wanted out as soon as possible. We went next door and contemplated ordering pizza.

Back home in Minneapolis, we have restaurants like Smack Shack and Freehouse that incorporate southern charm in their cooking. I try to bring some of this flavor into my own cooking, which is vegetarian, with collard greens with curry, eggs with hot sauce, etc. I was very impressed with the Knife & Tine's take on New American, inventing new flavors I had not experienced back in Minneapolis.We had a group of 8, and the Knife & Tine is perfect for large groups. While we were there, there was a group of 40 in a dining area in the front that can be separated from the main restaurant by glass and wood patio doors.

She brought chips and a medium spicy salsa along w the menu. I asked about the pozole and she brought a sample, and I agree w the reviewers, it was delicious. After a few minutes I asked the waitress for an enchilada / chile rellenos combination plate. She said she was new & would have to ask the owner. The owner came over and very politely advised they do not create custom combinations. I then ordered the enchilada dinner and a horchata to drink. The food came in a reasonable time and was served hot. Rice, beans, & a mild homemade enchilada sauce that was very tasty. I had 1 cheese, 1 steak, & 1 ground beef (piccadillo) enchilada ($11.99). The taste was okay, not great, but the lettuce on the plate was brown all over, obviously not fresh. The enchiladas were a little tough as I cut them but they might have been on the griddle before serving & if so that made the tortillas a little hard on the underside. I tried to get my waitress' attention several times, but she was either too busy eating or just not paying enough attention to see me waving my hand for over ten minutes.

I opted for its ground beef burrito (picadillo). For $4.60, it was solidly in the middle for its value. I excluded the tomatoes (It left them out.). Avocado is 50\u00a2 extra [unordered]. I also received its hot sauce (red). I thought this burrito needed the hot sauce. The ground beef itself was average. The lettuce was crispy, albeit underchopped. This was a competent burrito, competently made: Not too big, not too small. I am very comfortable with assigning Poncitlan a three-star rating.I dislike having to scrawl this. This was a venue in which I perceived _I was not the desired demographic_ for it. The print menu is the only place where you will espy English words. As a primary English-speaker, I seemed to be merely tolerated, and not especially welcomed. If your Spanish speaking is better than mine, give it a go in that language and see if you are treated better. [YMMV]Transit options: You will probably wind up on the #54 Cicero bus. It runs twenty hours a day, including every hour that Poncitlan is open. 3400 N. is Roscoe, which is equidistant to both the #77 Belmont & #152 Addison routes.

They were not soggy, however. Pretty okay. Not outstanding.

That alone has been so good I've never wanted anything else. This time around though, the beef was well... different. No longer as flavorful, not sure if it's the meat or the gravy, but it didn't taste as good as I remembered and they definitely skimped on the beef as well.They seem to be putting too much focus on pizza and too little on their beef. As disappointed as I am in the beef, it's still one of the better ones in that area. I won't go out of my way for their beef like I do for Jay's, Johnnie's or Boston's.
