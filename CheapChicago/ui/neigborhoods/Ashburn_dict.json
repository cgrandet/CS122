Don't worry, the cashier will come around in a minute or two. Aldi pays they employees very well, but has them do multiple jobs. When the cashier has no one in line, they sneak off for a few minutes to straighten up the store and restock items.Also, either bring your own recyclable bag or \u00a0you can buy a bag at the register for a mere .10. You will also bag your own groceries, there is no bagger. Love that they encourage people to bring in their own bags, another smart way they cut down on overhead and keep prices low!This is a great place to come for toys as well, the selection may not be huge but you can find some incredible deals. Especially around the holidays. They also sell random seasonal items for a good price, so well with popping in here on a regular basis. Don't be fooled by the low prices and think it's low quality. They are just very smart and efficient about running their business, cutting down on unnecessary over head and know how to keep prices low while paying employees well.

Love tearing them apart!) and most of all, perfectly cooked. A small miracle in a buffet!- crab legs- salmon on the plank (not very Chinese, sure, but still delicious)- steamed asparagus- octopus with chili peppersProbably not worth all the way down there but if you find yourself around for whatever reason (and I am sorry for you, really), a nice little spot to stop by.", "rating": "4", "date": [2010, 3, 19]}, "9": {"description": "I ate here about a week ago.

She did an excellent job and I didn't have any issues with it. For my next weave, I decided to go somewhere closer to home and ended up overpaying and getting a terrible job that ended up taking 7+ hours but that's for another review.I decided to come back to Savad's in the hopes that Sharita could do my hair quickly for graduation but she was completely booked. She referred me to another woman named Rochelle who I then called and scheduled an appointment with.I got a full head sew-in take down(not done by Rochelle) which was quick and didn't hurt at all. After my wash and braiding I was sent to Rochelle's station to actually get my hair installed. From the time I sat down to about when I was halfway finished, I saw about 3 women get full head sew-ins from Sharita. My hair ended up taking TEN HOURS. I was not aware that I was referred to a hairstylist who did not have extensive experience in sew-ins and I do feel that I should have been warned before I booked the appointment. One of the main reasons I decided to drive up to her shop was so that I wouldn't have to sit in a chair for so long as I have a....um..deficiency of fatty tissues in the buttocks area and joint issues. Shame on me for not asking, shame on Sharita for letting me sit in her shop ignorant.Overall the job done on my hair was ok but I really didn't want to spend my entire day in her shop.

So here's one for Savad's/Sharita.*****DISCLAIMER: I do NOT work for or WITH Savad's or Sharita in Any way. I have been a client of Sharita's for a few years and I hate to see anything but good reviews about because I know her work well. The pictures I added are from her website*****I've been a client of Sharita's since 2009. I was referred to her by a friend. I've been wearing sew-ins since 2005, and I've had many different stylists and methods done on my hair.What I will tell you is that I have NEVER had a sew in as wonderful as Sharita's. Period. My hair is so believably real that even people that KNOW me have to take a double take. I've had 22' inch hair in my head UNLAYERED, and people on the street thought it was growing from my headFACT: Sharita is EXTREMELY fast at sew-ins. For my most recent install (3/8/12), I arrived at 11am and was out the door at 1:30pm. This includes wash/condition, braiding, sew in, AND there was 1 person ahead of meFACT: The ladies in the salon can get loud. They do have a tendency to laugh and speak loudly to each other.FACT: It is BEST to make an appointment with Sharita. Although walk-ins are welcome, regardless of if you've had your hair done by her before, she WILL refer you to someone else if she's booked. NOTE: She is the fastest in the salon at sew-ins, so you're pressing your luck if you get referredFACT: Sharita cuts tracks towards the TOP of your hair in order for it to lay flat.FACT: Sharita does have phone conversations with other people while you're in her chair. The volume in which she's talking depends on the day and conversation. I've never been bothered by it.FACT: Unlike most women that must find one stylist for sew-in, one for cut, another for color, and one for styling, I can firmly say that Sharita can do ALL of the above. I was skeptical when I FIRST went to her in 2009, but on my second install, I was made a believer.FACT: If you stick with her, your hair will GROW. From November 2009 to October 2010, my hair grew over 9 inches. My hair was 1\" below my ear when I went to her initially and it grew to 2\" above my bra strap. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH SHARITA FOR A SEW-IN:- Call and make your appointment- When you walk in to her area in the back of the salon, say hello and Denise will wash your hair (assuming you don't require a take down)- Ja will blow dry and braid your hair (That girl is GREAT at braiding. She's fast and the braids are SMALL so the weave absolutely lays flat). Sharita will ask where you want your part (assuming you're not using a closure) and if you want your edges out. She'll part, Ja will braid from there.- Sharita will call you to her chair when it's your turn and she'll have you thread needles as she sews- When she's done sewing in, she will ASK you if you want her to layer it, if you want a blunt cut, curls, etc. She will also SHOW you what hair she has left over.- Pay using cash or credit, FIN!All in all, you may or may not be bothered by the other ladies in the salon. You may or may not be OK with waiting if you have people ahead of you. All in all I will GLADLY endure ALL of the above in exchange for the QUALITY and SPEED of her work.

I ask the older woman behind the counter were the greens made with meat and she said \"baby, i only use turkey in my greens.\" I am in heaven!

A lot of soul food cooks use pork in everything and I don't eat it.

Now my friend originally wanted the short ribs, but she said she sold the last one right before he arrived. While some may feel jaded by this, I think its pretty awesome that you sell out of food because it says:A) I cook based on needB) Your food will always be freshNow that means you have to get here a bit earlier to ensure you get your favorites. Now what sucked is that if you do get there closer to closing, they may have to make your dish from super scratch.

This is defintely super real (not authentic) Mexican food at its near best. Tortillas may not have been home made, but the food hit hard and just stood out. I also had a Corona (regualr sized) for $1.99 since it seems they have drink specials at any given time.

It really wasn't that big of deal but the girl who polished her nails didn't seem to have any remorse or concern which kinda peed me off. We shouldve ended our visit at nails polishing...The same girl did her hair and I was not impressed AT ALL. We opted for a press and style. When I asked her about how long it would take she told me 20 minutes. RED FLAG...again, I shouldve left. Anywho, my daughter left looking like she never had her hair styled. Her ponytails were uneven and it looked as if her hair was barely touched by the flat iron. \u00a0I was VERY dissatisfied because my bill was $75.00 and she only had nails painted the wrong color to show for it. For a moment I was thinking maybe we shouldve gotten her hair braided, but then I saw a finished product coming from the chair and knew that would've been an epic fail as well.

Amazing enough that I decided to fill out this form and add the recently opened store to Yelp. Don't want to read the details? Skip to the summary and head to Sleepy's!!I moved to Chicago from California with an apartment lined up, but no furniture. I figured the RoomPlace / the MattressPlace on Cicero would be a great option to get \u00a0a mattress quickly as they were advertising a sale, The place was clean and had a nice set-up, but the salesmen were aggressive and oozed shady. They refused to negotiate until they realized that though I flew in that morning, I wasn't born that morning. When they provided me with their 'best' price, I told them I would check out the surrounding shops to compare. The cocky salesman informed me that I would be back. The other shops I tried on Cicero aren't worth mentioning. They simply lacked quality. Then I stumbled into Sleepy's as a last resort before heading back to the shady salesman at the RoomPlace. Paul greeted me at the door and was professional yet personable. He was a true gentleman and gave honest feedback on the pros and cons of each mattress. I was thoroughly impressed with his knowledge. As opposed to trying to wheel and deal he simply let the facts speak for themselves. I found a mattress I liked and wanted to compare it to the one down the block at the RoomPlace. Paul understood me wanting a peace of mind and off I went to sit on the other bed. The shady salesman was quite smug and hovered as I sat on the bed trying to get a feel. I noticed that their pillow top bottomed out and my decision was made. I went back to Sleepy's where I received better service & a higher quality. Paul quickly checked me out and the delivery was accurate and smooth for an amazing price!Summary: Mistake = going to the RoomPlace / the MattressPlace.

Whatever they use to season the meat really just makes this an amazing sandwich. The fries are always cooked to a golden crisp perfection. And the gyro burger is kick ass as well.

The tattoos artists must actually be artists outside of their tattoo profession and have something else to show. I like that tattoo artists have art shows.2. The artists work with the clients to create/design up a tattoo that fits that particular client's needs/personality (after all, it is their job to be creative as an artist). 3. Reputation- I stay AWAY from the places that are over priced tourist traps.4. I look for artists who can venture away from the traditional \"out of the book\" tattoo design and know how to give realistic looking tattoos.5. The studio must be clean, and I like when the shop is uniquely decorated to the artists' style. 6. The ink must be good and the artists must be able to work on themselves,When it comes to Etched in Skin, I can say that I have only experienced 2 out of these 6 things. This shop looks like every other I've been to on the south side. Blah. Walking in, you do not see much creativity and can't really make out the personal styles of the artist(s). There was only one artist working here when I came in, so it's not like you have a choice as to your tattoo style.Now, as I said, I was young and dumb when I came in here, so I stuck to the book. I got what I paid for: over priced, cartoonish looking traditional tattoos. They aren't very big at all and don't have as much design and talent as others I have seen from elsewhere. One, I want covered up, the other, I can only hope to get covered up. It's not that she did a bad job with the tattoos. She didn't. Looking back, I can say that her designs just arent my style. The ink used at this place though is pretty awesome. I dont have much fading at all with my two tattoos. Any fading that I do have is probably due to me not putting anything on the tats when out in the sun. I did not like the personalilty of the artist. She seemed to herself in a way. Not very talkative. Something really shady about her. One day when I went in with one of my siblings, she acted high as a kite. This in itself is something that turned us away.When choosing a tattoo place, do your homework and don't go somewhere because it's close and convenient.
