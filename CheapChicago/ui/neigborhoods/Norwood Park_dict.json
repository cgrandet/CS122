Located on a quiet residential streets of bungalows and wide lawns, Newark Nook is a bar in a 100+ year old home. I met some friends there on a Sunday night for drinks, so the place was pretty slow, but they still had some hot dog fixings out from an earlier buffet and hand-printed posters advertising a Christmas party at the bar the night before. The ladies' bathroom has a remarkable selection of lotions and hairsprays (some look like they might be from the 80s). I give the Newark Nook 4 stars because it's important that places like this exist. It's family-owned, community-supported and has history and longevity. But, like the city I call home and love, it is flawed - sometimes even cringe-worthily so. The bartender was responsive - definitely not rude. But he certainly wasn't welcoming, warm or friendly. Even though I'm a northsider and my two friends are Norwood Parkers born and bred, we felt like outsiders. The back walls are covered in framed photos of cops - mainly of cops in riot gear. Some of cops in riot gear clashing with protesters. My favorite was the photo of a line of cops with shields and batons and a caption reading \"Welcome to Chicago. Now sit down and shut up.\" So this probably isn't the place to wear your \"I Can't Breathe\" shirt or reminisce about your Occupy Chicago days. I hope Newark Nook sticks around but, like a lot of Chicago neighborhoods, it's rooted in a time and place and attitude that should evolve.", "rating": "3", "date": [2014, 12, 30]}, "2": {"description": "Great Staff and prices.

It has been to darn hot for me to cook on the bar-b-q grill. We decided to give this place a shot after reading the Yelp reviews. I got the impression that maybe the Yelpers who reviewed this place are \"locals\" from the area (or perhaps work close to the area) or they haven't really tried super incredible Asian food. \u00a0Oh, but I digress. Let's get down to the review now. \u00a0I ordered the chicken and pineapple fried rice for $8 (was worth maybe $6). They also have another location in Park Ridge, IL.My niece ordered three different sushi dishes. She said they were very, very good. I cannot rate the sushi because I didn't have any, and I was not offered any to \"taste.\" Her sushi was brought out within five minutes. On the other hand, my food did not arrive at the same time. My niece was half-way through with her sushi by the time my food arrived. Not cool. My food tasted like it had been cooked in burned stale oil. It had a nasty burned taste to it which I couldn't stomach. I was starting to feel sick, so I stopped eating. It had a very bad taste and it left a horrible after-taste. Awful. Quantity over quality drives this restaurant. I don't think they will be around for more than one or two more years -- if they are lucky. Our Server came over twice because she must have noticed that I wasn't eating my dinner. She asked, \"Is everything okay?\" How do you answer that question without offending her. Maybe I should have said it tasted like burned oil, but I didn't want to be rude since our Server was very sweet. I smiled. I asked for a \"to go\" box. My niece told her I didn't like my food because it had a funny taste. She said, \"Oh, it's probably the curry -- I don't like curry -- maybe it was the curry.\" Again, I smiled. I didn't say a word. Believe me, it was NOT the curry!!! Then, I thought maybe she will not charge me for it, because I only took three forkfuls of rice. I barely touched the food and she obviously noticed. Well, I got nailed for the entire amount (even though I barely touched it). I took it home and gave it to my husband who will eat anything. Really. He has a cast-iron stomach. I wondered if she would have charged me the full amount if I told her I didn't want to take it home with me. Whatever (with sarcasm)!The restaurant has lime green walls, with a long wooden bench against the wall. It has nine tables for parties of two or four. The aesthetics are worthy of two stars. It is the kind of place where you eat fast, because you want to get the hell out of there. I noticed they still have some Christmas decorations up (green garland), and three large gold stars in the window. They are probably the same people who leave up their Christmas lights year-round -- never take them down. The glass windows are large, but it was dark and dingy inside the restaurant (even though it was a sunny, bright day). The light fixtures consist of off-white squared-shaped paper lanterns hanging above several tables. I was really, really disappointed with what I ordered. Thus, I rate it with ONE star. My final rating is TWO stars, because we had no issues parking in this area and found a legal spot in front of the restaurant. However, service is worthy of THREE stars. Would I come back here again? Did I like the food? I am sure you can guess the answers to these questions! (with sarcasm)BTW, my niece liked the sushi that she ordered. She had three different kinds of sushi and it was $20 (excluding tip). I thought it was a bit pricey. Come on! This is not the Butterfly Sushi restaurant. I wouldn't know what her sushi tasted like, because she never offered any to me. Yeah, whatever. Also, I didn't bother to ask her \"can I have some of your sushi\" even though my tummy was roaring and growling with hunger. My evening ended with me going to Mariano's and purchasing dinner for myself. It was spicy salmon sushi which was made fresh and before my eyes. You cannot beat the sushi at Mariano's -- really, really fresh and quality ingredients are used in every roll. This restaurant is located in an odd location -- right next door to the State Farm Insurance Co. This is not a very exciting area of the city. Nothing. \u00a0Dead. Boring.

Interesting variety of tables - high, low, long and short. \u00a0Service was hectic, but server was great. \u00a0BBQ wings were flavorable, juicy and cooked perfectly. \u00a0Salad with chicken was standard faire, Margarita pizza -tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, parmesan, pecorino, evoo, and basil came to table cold, was sent back for a replacement. \u00a0Four cheese \u00a0- Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, asiago, provolone, fontina, evoo was not hot either, but consumed anyway. \u00a0The \"Smokin' Piggy\" Burger - Grilled 1/2 pound burger with smoked mozzarella piggy-backed with house made bbq pulled pork and tabasco fried onions, served on brick oven bun was delicious. Four stars would be deserved if the food was hot when served. \u00a0Manager came to the table and asked so was told, and offered to discount the food and was apologetic.

We sit down and the actual consulting supervisor, she had short blonde curly hair, attempts to put words in my girl friends mouth by saying that in the original consultation my gf wanted to be more blonde! \u00a0My gf quickly disagrees and states to her that she NEVER said that at all. \u00a0The CB (curly blonde) smirks and says \"then there was a miscommunication.\" \u00a0Is it not your job lady to listen to what customers want, otherwise why are you in this business. \u00a0This is responded to by Chauncey stating \"well we think your hair is beautiful.\" \u00a0First off, who really cares what you think about someone elses hair color or style. \u00a0It is not YOUR hair, so what are you doing trying to give your opinion on how someone else feels about their hair! \u00a0Secondly, they state that because it is a school they would either refund 50% back or they would try to fix it. \u00a0 In what other business is there a 50% refund. \u00a0I do not expect one of my patrons to come into my restaurant, explain to my server what they want, the server brings out a dish completely different and expect that patron to not only eat it but also pay for half. \u00a0I would either fix their meal or not charge them. The curly haired blonde seemed snarky and rude as she continued to fondle my gf's hair making comments that seemed to be obviously not in laymans terms. \u00a0She was speaking in tricoci code or hair stylists terms.

First, she didn't care to know my name or at least tell me hers. The whole time I was getting my hair washed (the part of the hair cut that I love the best) I was practically being deafened by all the water in my freaking ears.

There, I had my first facial ever. It was interesting. It began with a questionnaire about my skin regimen. How was I to know SOAP was the enemy? \u00a0Within the first few minutes, \u00a0I was told that I probably should see a dermatologist. Although it probably is true, it wasn't what I expected to hear. My skin is pretty good, all things considered. They have different kinds of facials for different skin types. I was asked what I considered my problem areas...my guess is that most people without major problems have no idea what problems they have (or, this is their job to tell me my skin needs extra assistance...). On to the facial....it was good, in a no frills way. There was soothing music, but the room is spartan, with many treatment tables all in one room - yes, it is a school, not a spa! \u00a0Frankly, since I'd never had a facial before and didn't know what one includes, I'm not sure if mine was fabulous, routine, or sub-par, but it was pleasant. If I had gone to a top notch spa, I may have felt more pampered. At the end of my facial, I was shown products that I could use to keep my skin at it's best. I'm sure they are great products, but they were high end products which were a bit out of my reach. Maybe next time. (One note on the facial room - Mario Tricoci university - PLEASE clean the ceiling filters! \u00a0All of us are looking up to a dusty ceiling that has black grime and dust along the air system...). \u00a0I know this happens, and it's not a big deal, but it would be more appealing if this wasn't noticeable. \u00a0I also had a manicure. The price point is the same as one of those no appointment nail places, but you won't zip in and out, if that is a priority. I like to use my own polish, but they have to use OPI, as they are sponsors of the school. I miss using my own polish, because within hours of a manicure, I invariably chip the polish. It's a lot easier if I have a back-up polish at home to do one nail than the entire manicure. I did chip the polish off several nails only 3 hours after I left! \u00a0I had to totally remove it after 2 days (usually I only get a few chips during the entire week after a manicure). \u00a0I am not sure if this is due to the student who was new, or the polish, but this is the first time this has ever happened to me (and I do get manicures/pedicures routinely and never have an issue). \u00a0The students are very pleasant, and want to do well, especially as they are graded for each client. They do hair cuts and coloring as well. As in any school, you may be paired up with the best student in the class or the worst. These students have to put in a certain amount of hours to finish the program. Invariably, you probably will run up against a student who is merely going through the motions....ie...step one, step two, etc, until the finish line. It may take a while for some students to catch on to the notion that their future career is not just based on doing the service, and all the steps required, but that his/her attitude, appearance, and genuine desire to make someone feel better, look better, is just as important. Those students who can put themselves in their client's shoes, give a little extra, make the effort to be personable, and truly want that client to enjoy the experience, will be rewarded both now and in the future, with higher tips and return clients.If you have ample time, patience, don't need frills and understand that these are supervised students who aren't yet professionals, try Tricoci beauty school. Remember, though, that sometimes things aren't perfect and this is not luxurious. The manicure section is off in the back, and some instructors review other areas of the school/students, so they have to make a special effort to come into the back. \u00a0This wasn't an issue for me, but if a student needed help, it may take a bit longer. \u00a0In any case, you'll be part of someone's training, so there may be pluses and minuses.

She was extremely professional, and I didn't mind at all that she took her time to make sure my hair turned out perfect. It was when Tania had finished with the highlights that I began to regret going there. Tania had passed me over to another very pleasant student for my haircut. As she was combing out my hair the teacher, Ms. Char, came over to inform us that there was a meeting starting, so I would have to pay for my highlights and wait in the waiting area until the meeting was over in 30 minutes. She didn't apologize or acknowledge that this was obviously an inconvenience to me. Tania and the other student were very apologetic and said they had never seen this happen before.  \u00a0I was slightly bothered by this, especially seeing as my hair was still wet and it had already been over 4 hours, but went to the counter to pay for the highlights. When I got to the counter I noticed that my bag, a Louis Vuitton bag that was a gift from my fianc\u00e9 had hair dye on one side. Since it's a light colored bag, it was quite noticeable. \u00a0Tania tried removing the dye with no success. I know accidents can happen, but I was disheartened none the less. I sat down to wait until 5:30 when the meeting was supposed to be over. I was concerned that my hair was drying and curling, as my hair is naturally curly. I was worried this would effect the cut, but there was nothing I could do. 5:30 came and went, and at 6:00 I finally decided to leave. \u00a0My hair was completely dry at that point, and no one had come by to apologize for the much longer wait than what I had expected.

Today was probably my 4th time (I average about once a year) and decided my last review was too heavily biased on a really good experience. So I made an appointment for myself today and set aside 4 hours to have everything done(it ended up taking about 3 1/2 hours). It's important to come mentally prepared that it's going to take awhile because they are students and they're learning, that's a given. My hair is past my shoulder and I wanted a cut and color. After I told the stylist what I wanted in terms of color, she started prepping and mixing and had the instructor sign off on the work to be done. She was very quiet, I guessed she was probably new to the program. About 2 hours in the color had been applied, I had been rinsed and now I was headed back to the chair for the cut. The thing that kills me is that she never asked me what kind of haircut I wanted. When she had the scissors already in her hand, she asked me how much I wanted off. I told her an inch. She worked silently on my haircut, the instructor came by to check on her every half hour or so. I had already decided that I didn't want to try anything new, I just thought it was funny that she just assumed that I wanted the same cut. At the end of the 3 1/2 hours, my hair was cut, dried and styled with a round brush(i think iron or curling is extra). I was pleased with the cut, but I noticed in the mirror's reflection that the color had not come out as evenly as it has in the past, I could see my natural color and it almost looked like low-lites. No one mentioned it, and I just sort of let it go. I really wanted to get out of that chair, and part of me wasn't sure if maybe I was just imagining it. \u00a0For $50 and a longer than usual amount of time in the chair, I got a nice cut and color. I do agree with other \u00a0reviewers when they say that the atmosphere is less than professional, it often feels sorority-esque. There's a lot of excessive socializing and discussing classes, even with clients in the chair. And today I think they had some sort of styling contest that everyone was cheering about. I think the instructors should check in on their students more than they do, and maybe give them a little more guidance than what I experienced today, not just signatures on their sheets. For example, I think my experience would have been better if she had asked me what I wanted in a haircut, asked if I liked that cut she gave me, if I wanted something changed, or if I wanted my fringe trimmed. Overall, I'm satisfied but I think that new stylists need more help with their clients than what they're given. _____________________________________________________All i can say is \"wow\". I went this morning for a haircut when the place opened at 9:30 and I waited about five minutes for a stylist. I wasn't sure what to expect from a student haircut, but for $17 ($12 for shorter than shoulder length) dollars I was willing to try. My stylist, Paulina, was very friendly and professional and even told me a little about what it was like going to school there. I was worried since my hair was super long and i wanted to take a lot off, but she was very methodical and careful with it, occasionally asking for advice from one of the teachers. There were about 3 teachers that walked around and supervised the students while they worked. Because it was basically dead in there, one of the teachers was watching her most of the time while she worked. When it came time for the \"fringe\" (i didn't know there was another word for bangs), she brought the teacher over so that she could get it just the way i wanted it. i was thankful she didn't pretend that she could do everything, when she needed help she asked for it. The teacher was very professional and my fringe turned out beautifully(she was even able to work with my cowlick). I guess at the end the teachers normally will check the work to make sure everything is right, but she didnt have to because she was watching and could see that it was a beautiful cut :) i think i made it out of there in a little \u00a0under 2 hours, so its not a quick process--they're learning, after all. And i'm sure mine took longer than usual since i had so much hair. I was so happy with my cut and style that it felt pretty criminal paying only $17 so i left her a big tip.

I don't think a lot of guys get haircuts here, so many of the workers are not familiar with how to cut men's hair. However, I have had some ladies cut my hair very well. Very recently, a guy named Edwin cut my hair. He knew what he was doing, and he was very competent. If you're a guy and are getting a haircut here, I would recommend going to him, because I was very happy with the result. I've been here many times (maybe 10-15), have had a lot of different cuts, and I've colored my hair twice here. I strongly recommend asking for someone that has more experience. The employees are students and some of them have been there longer than others. A couple times I've gone there and it took 2 hours for just a haircut which is ridiculous, but other times I've had an amazing experience. It's very cheap which is why I keep coming back, but I would bring in a picture and be specific with what you want done along with asking for someone with more experience. Pros: Cheap service, polite staff, and generally good haircuts. Cons: Have had bad haircuts with long waits a few times, and the students come and go fairly quickly.

Even if we may not be feeling attractive or without makeup, hair can make or break the situation. Apparently, the employees of Kahlo Salon do not understand this fact.I have been looking for a salon ever since my friend moved away. She was my hair dresser and by the way, an amazing one. All I was looking for was a trim and to get my roots done - this means matching your roots to the rest of your hair. That being said, my roots do not match the rest of my hair AT ALL. At the salon, I saw a slight difference but due to the dim light, I did not fully see how horrible it looked until I got home. My roots literally look orange and the rest of my hair is blond with low-lights. Devon was the name of the girl that attempted to do my hair. She seemed like a very nice person and we talked a bit, but she clearly did not know what she was doing. I told her my friend used to do my hair and she asked me if I knew the brand and number of the dye. Obviously, hair stylists should be able to look in their color book and match up the color. I was never asked this question before. I should have known then to get up and leave, but I was still hopeful from the Yelp reviews that she would do a good job. She told me that she has been a hair stylist for a couple of years and I am appalled that she still has not learned anything. The only decent thing she did was trimming my hair, which does not say much.On top of that, the receptionist at Kahlo Salon was unbelievably rude. She seemed nice at first when she offered me something to drink, but as soon as it was time to pay up, that all changed. I had bough a YouSwoop deal for this salon and the receptionist rolled her eyes and sighed when I had not printed the coupon. Who prints coupons nowadays in the age of smart phones? Why waste paper? The number was clearly visible on my phone. There was also another customer ahead of me who was also appalled. Finally, she took our numbers down and then, she charged me the wrong amount at first and if I had not pointed it out, I would have paid far less.

The stents alone had been stressful enough! So it had been a painful week. Nevertheless, I was sitting this morning in front of my mirror, getting dressed, and all I could think of was, Darn, that's one great haircut! Which is what several folks in the heart lab had already said, as I was wheeled from one station to another and gradually but surely stripped of every element of style except the hair on my head: wow, great haircut! Then they covered it up with one of those paper things, but still!Because Renata came through. She was undaunted by my request that she give me a haircut that would at least look good in a hospital bed if not a mortuary. She didn't even raise an eyebrow. She didn't even blink. She just waxed my own brows perfectly--and youthfully, something no other eyebrow specialist seems to be able to achieve. And the haircut I sported to my hospital ordeal cheered me, and as any person can tell you, it really can make all the difference in handling a challenge, any kind of challenge at all. So I was sincerely grateful this morning for the help, and thought of leaving a Yelp review.

We all asked our server Christina for seperate checks as it was just easier in the long run.To begin with, our server takes drink orders from a friend, my wife, and myself. She then moves on to another table and begins to take their drink order. Ok, fair enough. However, she then spends the next 10 minutes taking their food orders. No drinks yet for us even when my friend had brought it to her attention. No response. After 15 minutes since taking our order, another male server heads towards us with a tray of drinks but surprise! They are drinks for the table that ordered after us. No drinks. No water. No service for us.After a good 20 minute wait for our drinks, Christina takes our food order. She counldn't tell me waht goes on their cheesburgers. Her response was, \"The regular things you get, you know.\" I then decide to give a specific order of \"just lettuce,pickle, tomato and put it all on the side.\" I figured if things went wrong at least it wouldn't be ON my burger. And she says, \"Oh, so you want everything?\" NO! I want it with what I asked you for.When our food finally arrives, some orders are wrong, Fries instead of mac and cheese, No quessadias, etc. My burger came with onion and other items on the burger. When I informed the male server that it had come with items I didn't want on it, he says out loud while walking away laughing, \"Yeah, we did that to make you mad.\" No apoligy. No can I fix that for you. No service.Although the food was OK for the most part, the service was horrible. From waiting for our drinks, taking food orders and being served additional drinks, it was the worst I have experienced in a long time. When it came time for our bills, everyone looked up at each other in dibelief as our server asked each and every one of us what we had ordered and scribbled it down again. The bills arrived and she was still confused.Paying the bills also seemed like an ordeal for her. In one instance, our friends $29 billed was swiped and charged up as $69. All of our bills (even though added separately) also were charged an automatic 18% gratuity which was way more then any of them deserved. It is our observation that either Christina is the worst waitress ever or simply very inexperienced with no training or guidance which in that case, is managements fault. The attitude of the staff is poor and indifferent which makes the experience at Bar Louie O'Hare less than enjoyable or memorable. It is not on my list of repeats. The sad thing is the staff doesn't even realize how poor their service is.", "rating": "2", "date": [2013, 9, 3]}, "8": {"description": "My best friend works in the hospitality industry close to O'hare so this was the go to spot after work to get a bite to eat and some drinks.

First off the place is pretty spacious so no worries about getting a table when you walk in. The place is dark with a bunch of booths, tables, and bar seating. All the staff are young 20s-30s. Decent service. BREAKFAST:First off, they offer regular breakfast items or buffet in the morning. They open at 6am despite what a lot of the advertisement and whatnot says. I've only had the buffet because I was always in a rush. Although it didn't look like it took too long for the food to arrive. Buffet consists of: scrambled eggs, potatoes with green peppers & onions, bacon/sausage, either french toast or pancakes, cut up fruit, toast/bagels, cereal, and orange juice. They'll ask you right away if you want coffee. I thought breakfast was pretty decent. Great way to start off the day! DINNER:BLT Wedgeiceberg lettuce, bacon, tomato, onion, egg, blue cheese crumbles, blue cheese dressing, house vinaigrette - at first I thought there wasn't enough dressing and told my waiter to bring me more but there was enough. It is a mixture of two different dressings. If you are picky about your dressings please inquire. Overall, not bad. One weekdays, they have half-off select appetizers from 4-7pm!Bruschetta Pomodorotomato, basil, garlic, olive oil, parmesan crostinis available with shrimp - Comes with like 12 pieces of hard-slightly burnt bread. The actual bruschette was really good. I liked it! If only the bread was tastier. Cheese Quesadillapepper jack, cheddar, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole - This is decently good.

Mind you, the non stop flight to O'Hare is less than four hours and we share the same time zone.

I don't know why he couldn't get up and do it himself or thinks badgering me to hurry up and call no restaurant in particular for him would motivate me to work faster in nursing his jetlag and starvation. Yes, I'm being sarcastic! The more impatient he became, the more belligerent and ridculous he went about his tyrade. It's a holiday weekend and most people are out enjoying a barbecue-except us. A more pertinent reason for my delay in assisting him is his forgetfulness that I don't care for Stuffed, Pan, Hand Tossed and Deep Dish Pizza.As much as I advocate supporting local businesses, I'm still learning about Harwood Heights and its surrounding areas. I couldn't do it efficiently without the help of the Yelp mobile app. Yelp members who take the time to write unbiased \u00a0reviews get FUC'd for making it easy. I never would've found this place without them! Thank you, everyone!For $26.20 + $5 tip, I ordered a Large Stuffed Cheese Pizza with fresh garlic, sliced tomatoes, spinach, pepperoni and sausage. It came to our front door in less than an hour.

Any more than that and I encounter undesirable side effects: bloating, fatigue, gas, weight gain... all the reasons why I avoid eating slices thicker than thin. Needless to say, that generous triangular slice I put on my plate was \"mmm mmm\" out loud fabulous. I even cut a second slice of Trio's pizza in half because for once in my life, I wanted more!

Their coffee guys are so on the ball that they almost over-caffeinate you.The food was actually pretty good. It was solid diner fare. \u00a0I ordered the Belgium waffle with the 'fresh, frozen strawberries' which made me laugh. The waffle does get a little soggy from the fruit, but can you really notice when they overcompensate with a mound of whipped cream? My corned beef has was a little salty, but at a diner I figured as much. However, I did like that it wasn't overly soggy and had a bit of crunch which kept me coming back for more. Overall it seemed that my party enjoyed their meal. I mean my dad just ordered ham off the bone and got a plate of ham...off the bone. No complaints there at all.Our waitress was very nice and was even patient with us when we originally forgot to mention that we wanted to split our bill.

They said they always have carrot cake in-stock and there is no need to special order one. So what if that day you sold the only carrot cakes in-stock? They said call early in the morning. OK fine. We asked that since it's a BIRTHDAY cake, is it possible to NOT have it decorated with carrots all over the top? (The carrot cake has an icing design of carrots all across the border.) She had to ask in the back. She came back and said no, it's not possible. WTF? OK. Can you write Happy Birthday on it? Yes, when you pick it up. Talk about accommodating!!! She was rude the whole time too. I should've walked out at this point, but I was desperate for a cake. As far as cake designs go, if you ask for flowers on the cake, they will plop a sugar flower on the cake and draw some leaves with icing. Don't expect pretty icing designs. I don't think they pride themselves on stuff like that.Anyways, I've been coming to The House of Cakes for around 15 years mainly because it's practically tradition and super local.Their Coffee Cakes are EXCELLENT. The caramel pecan one is a personal favorite. Try to stop in early in the morning because they sell fast. They are always fresh and are a real good size for around $7.Their Zeppoli are another personal favorite along with the Large Chocolate Canolis. The actual cakes are pretty decent. The cake is really light and airy (not dense at all like birthday cake).. the consistency is almost like sponge cake. The buttercream is also really light and has a consistency similar to whipped cream. If you're looking for a super heavy birthday cake with thick, sugary frosting, this is not the place. Nothing is sickly sweet here, which many people like. (Although I do like a slice of cheap Jewel cake once in a while..) I like ordering the white cake with whipped custard filling and buttercream icing. It's pretty basic, but I really like it. It's also really good with fudge icing. Their carrot cake is also really good.I've also tried their pizza bread. It's pretty good.

It is about 4 to 5 inches long and filled with sweet whipped creamy cheese. Yes, it was tasty, but not worthy of five stars. They top it off with powdered sugar, which makes it messy to eat. I don't think it needs the powdered sugar though. Cheese stick = 4 stars. I ended up buying several brownies, which are worthy of five stars. The bottom of the brownie is dusted with sugar. The brownie was chocolaty and moist (more like a cake than a brownie). The texture was creamy and smooth. My husband likes anything with apples, so I thought I would buy a few to take home. We had them the next day, and I was surprised how tasty these were. I like that you can buy individual slices as opposed to an entire apple pie. Apple slices = 4-1/2 stars. I have had their cakes from here. A few people that I know have ordered Birthday cakes from here (including yours truly). They use quality butter cream, real fresh strawberries to fill the center of the cake and are beautifully decorated. They will also put fresh whipped cream on your cake if you do not like butter cream. I prefer the butter cream though. Cakes = 5 stars. You can select whatever colors and design you would like for a Birthday cake or pick one of their own designs which are on display. The cake that I usually order is under $22, which is reasonable and serves up to 8 people.The bakery is located in a very odd location.

Since I was meeting someone for a late lunch at Nonna Silvia's I decided to stop into this little \"Dive\" and pick up a few sweets. This is \"cash\" only and is a family owned mom-and-pop operation. They also sell ice cream cakes, and are much cheaper than the Dairy Queen's ice cream cakes. This bakery could use a major update (looks like something out of the late 1980's or early 1990's).

There were 3 main things I really enjoyed:Food: The fried calamari was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of crispy and chewy. And the spicy tomato sauce was so tasty! I ordered the Rigatoni alla Vodka which was also very good but I really loved the Pappardelle al Pesto that my boyfriend ordered. The pesto sauce was so flavorful and the large pieces of shrimp and dried cherry tomatoes really topped it off nicely. The portions were a good size too, FYI. Service: The staff was great!! Everyone was so friendly. From the host/hostess at the door, to the waitress, to the funny and entertaining bartender (I was even charmed into getting a glass of wine), the entire staff was just so nice and attentive. The chef even stopped by our table twice to see how everything was going and even asked if we needed more bread. EXCELLENT customer service. Ambiance: On top of everything I've mentioned, I think my favorite part of this place was the atmosphere. The restaurant is small and cozy but not claustrophobic feeling. I didn't realize how deep the restaurant goes back. There's even a nice little bar back there. This place definitely is a nice little, local, neighborhood gem. I think we were the only people there who were first timers. It seemed like everyone who walked in was a regular and knew the staff by name.

Mark Giannini is fantastic as owner and a classically-trained Italian chef, coming from a multi-generational family of restaurateurs. I am delighted when he roams the dining area, going from table to table to make sure the food is good and that patrons are enjoying themselves. When was the last time you were in a business that did that?Having been to Italy, the dining room reminds me of the small, out-of-the-way basement trattorias in Florence, which I find charming. However, on a packed night, some folks might find themselves uncomfortable, as you might be bumping elbows with other diners. The staff is generally attentive, with one particular server having a delicious sense of humor. My father was a stern, humorless German, and this guy had him chuckling. He knew how to work a crowd. (Sorry, can't remember his name).Please allow me to make a qualified statement: The food here is close to exceptional. However, like it or not, hot fat tastes good. I don't mean this in a derogatory sense; rather, I am simply stating the obvious. Good Italian cooking can be high in calories and carbs. I believe militant vegans or vegetarians will find it hard to find something to their liking here (they may have veggie/vegan dishes here, but I've never tried them). The pasta dishes with cream sauces can be very rich. They're generally made with actual cream and butter. Personally, I'm often in the mood for just such a dish, but some folks might find it a turn-off. I've had the Raviola di Zucca (pumpkin ravioli) with both the creamy balsamic sauce and the butter-sage and parmesan sauce at different times. Both are superb (one of their more consistent dishes), though one sauce definitely has a sweeter bent (sorry, can't remeber which one). On a recent visit, my daughter had the Rigatoni alla Vodka and mom had the Lasagna Bolognese. Both were excellent.On the SPECIALS menu, try the Branzino alla Griglia (Chilean sea bass), another of their excellent, consistent dishes, as I've had it several times. It's difficult to get good fish right, as most restaurants under- or over-cook it. I've never been disappointed with this dish. Also, if you're a seafood fan, PA makes a dish called Linguini del Mare full of mussels, shrimp, scallops, fresh fish and calamari. Dad had this often and was never disappointed.Also, try the calamari appetizer. Very good.

One was beef carpaccio, some mozzarella ball with a soft core, and I can't remember but it wad good. I had duck canneloni and it was good. This a preference if mine but a little less meat and one more tube and cheese. That's me. My wife enjoyed her pumpkin ravioli in a balsamic glaze. We shared deserts and they were great.

My boyfriend wanted to try some place new around the area and we ended up at Pasta D'Arte. We were a little worried about the place being crowded since it was a Saturday night, but luckily they were able to seat us right away. There were 3 main things I really enjoyed:Food: The fried calamari was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of crispy and chewy. And the spicy tomato sauce was so tasty! I ordered the Rigatoni alla Vodka which was also very good but I really loved the Pappardelle al Pesto that my boyfriend ordered. The pesto sauce was so flavorful and the large pieces of shrimp and dried cherry tomatoes really topped it off nicely. The portions were a good size too, FYI. Service: The staff was great!! Everyone was so friendly. From the host/hostess at the door, to the waitress, to the funny and entertaining bartender (I was even charmed into getting a glass of wine), the entire staff was just so nice and attentive. The chef even stopped by our table twice to see how everything was going and even asked if we needed more bread. EXCELLENT customer service. Ambiance: On top of everything I've mentioned, I think my favorite part of this place was the atmosphere. The restaurant is small and cozy but not claustrophobic feeling. I didn't realize how deep the restaurant goes back. There's even a nice little bar back there. This place definitely is a nice little, local, neighborhood gem. I think we were the only people there who were first timers. It seemed like everyone who walked in was a regular and knew the staff by name. It's not hard to see why this place has such a loyal clientele. In a nutshell, a definite must-try spot in the Jefferson Park/Gladstone Park area.

She also brought a small dish of giardiniera (Italian pickled vegetables)...I was liking this place more and more!All four of us ordered something different. I started with a house green salad. Mixed greens were piled up in the center of the plate and around the perimeter of this green leafy stack were arranged sliced cucumbers, green peppers and cherry tomatoes. Long, thin curly cues of shaved carrots topped it all. I ordered it without dressing so I could drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar myself, then dusted it with the grated Parmesan cheese.I ordered the one of the specials: Ravioli Di Asparagi. This homemade ravioli was filled with asparagus and ricotta, served in a roasted chicken demiglace sauce with chunks of zucchini, butternut squash, and sun-dried tomato, and topped with shaved grans padano. It was light and flavorful. It was excellent! The portions were large, but I did save room for desert. We tried a trio of their special deserts: Homemade flan (I didn't know Italians did flan?), chocolate mousse cake topped with pistachio gelato and homemade tiramisu.

I rolled down the window so he could tell me what was going on and while he moved into my window closer to me he noticed a wine bottle in the parking lot space right next to me, seems someone has a classy romantic night here...lol anyhow he told me what the attendant said as well as the typical \"you're gonna have to pull up your order is going to be awhile,\" so we must have waited about 15 minutes. Not sure why it took 15 minutes since it appeared they had a full kitchen staff monkeying around when I passed the drive through window and that fact that he and I were the only customers with a small order not certain what took so long, maybe they were in the back killing the chicken that was on my sandwich...lol though highly unlikely.

So in that respect, this is a great place to have an event.I am not a huge fan of the pizza...it is good but doesn't blow me away. I do like the crust. I am a fan of the pasta with marinara! It was delicious at our event! However, the party room we were in had a giant open doorway (5 times the width of a door) to the actual restaurant seating area. The night we were there, they seemed to purposely seat all incoming guests in the tables directly adjacent to the large open arch to the party room. Maybe they wanted to give the appearance of a \"happening place\" since there were only a handful of regular tables filled. But they complained we were making too much noise, and I think it could have been handled better. We're not kids, and our business far outnumbered the other guests that came in that night. The party room we were given (don't know if they have others) is completely open to the restaurant!Pluses are the staff, some good dishes, the convenient location, and even the party room is nice. Minuses are they need privacy screens or maybe actual glass doors between the restaurant and their private area, and also need to have a plan in place for how to address issues of loud music from a party. Maybe it all has to be understood in advance, or structurally accounted for.Would I use them again? Yes.

My favorites are the \"Healing Soup\" bowls - The Steve's Super Shitake Noodle Wonder Soup if you want something with a mild taste (and love mushrooms), and The Dr. K's Cure All Noodle Soup if you want something with a more spicy kick. And the Dr. K's really does help if you have a cold. Another great menu selection they have are their teas. First time I went there, I ordered a Citron Tea and was surprised to find out it wasn't actual tea, or even herbal tea, it was hot brewed citron in water, which basically tasted like hot lemonade, and is the most amazing thing to drink if you have a cold or sore throat (or just really like lemon). They also have a ginger tea that's ginger brewed in hot water, and is perfect for an upset stomach - I used to stop by there when I was pregnant just to get the tea.The rest of their menu is a really wide variety of vegan rice bowls, stews, noodles, bibimbop, all with different vegetables and flavor combos, and all great.Amitabul is definitely one of the top vegetarian spots in Chicago!", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 10, 9]}, "49": {"description": "Don't be fooled by the unassuming decor of this restaurant.

Long story short, after several drive-by to the Belmont place on Sunday with no luck I saw a Nottollis on Harlem as I was coming home from Marianos. This place WAS opened Sunday.

Plus, some of their salads (in the deli case) look dried out, i.e., old.Their lunch meat is definitely quality and very well-priced. Their fresh cheese selection is stellar. They have a hot bar as well as Italian homemade food in the frozen section. Most of that is good, but sometimes it's bland. Their cannolis are nothing to sing about.The store reminds me of the kind I grew up with around the Grand/Austin area. I have a lot of nostalgia and warm memories of those places.

Located on the east side of Harlem Avenue it reminded me of a well-known Italian deli that I went to in NYC several years ago. This place looks like a deli from a movie that's set in a New York deli (Note to Self: Work on Screenplay). It has \u00a0been in this location for over 30 years. I ordered the Italian sub and it was loaded with fresh meats -- a mix of cured meats with provolone cheese, Iceberg lettuce finely shredded, slices of tomatoes, and an oil-vinegar dressing. The inclusion of a sneaky, but assertive pepper jam is what won me over. It is the quintessential classic Italian sub sandwich. Is there any better way to prepare this delectable sandwich? I think not!The sub here hits every element of a classic Italian combo. It's a well-balanced sandwich and not too heavy despite its ample stuffing. The bread held up nicely with the amalgamation of over-stuffed fillings and a sweet brine that decked out every flavor. The exterior of the bread was crispy and the interior was fluffy light. The bread is from D'Amato's Bakery, and the freshness and quality was very obvious to my palette. \u00a0There were cured meats hanging in front of the deli counter (if you are tall be careful not to bump your head). They make their own gravy (Americans call this \"sauce\") from scratch as well as lasagna, mostaccioli and cannoli. They sell authentic Italians products and have a variety of cheeses on hand. This is a mom and pop operation. It is narrow and small but well compact with loads of products. They also have a parking lot. Be careful not to hit the mother sucker huge pot hole upon entering or exiting the parking lot. Service was hospitable but not overly effusive. The deli and grocery store are well maintained and clean.I stumbled upon this joint on March 11, as I had an appointment in the area. I was driving north bound on Harlem Ave to hop back onto the Kennedy expressway and head back home when I noticed \"Nottoli Italian Foods & Deli\" on the east side of Harlem Avenue. Now, I have been to Bari Deli & Grocery and also Tony's Deli on Northwest Highway over 25 times. I am a sub sandwich snob, so I had to give Nottoli's a shot. It was an unexpected, spontaneous find! I can honestly say that the Italian sub sandwich here stands up to the delectable sub sandwiches at Bari (on W Grand Ave). I do not often drive out-of-the way for a deli, but this is one joint where I would return. I'd like to try their meatball, Italian beef and Italian sausage sub sandwiches. \u00a0My 6-inch Italian sub was $5.99 and the double Italian bread was $2.69. I was in and out in under 5-minutes. Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom! (P.S. You have to spend $10 or above to use your Debit card. However, it really depends on WHO is working the front register. If it is the \"old\" lady or \"old\" man walk away and go elsewhere. I stopped here on April 4, 2015. I ended up leaving the sub sandwich on the counter and walking away because she said I had to spend $10 or more. I saw NO SIGN that mentioned this in the store). Not cool.

Almost offensive to say, but this is a truly \"authentic\" Italian market that probably does 95% of its business to local residents who have always shopped there in search of the best Italian meats, cheeses, olives, and breads. It hasn't been polished to cater to trust fund wannabe food bloggers whose \"of the people\" claim is High Life consumption. For this reason, the prices are staggering.The deli portion of the store is at the rear, while the center store consists of three aisles of pastas, spices, breads, and a few sauces (I assume for the folks who don't make their own). Fresh pastries/cookies are located right at the counter. The front of Nottoli's has two small high-top tables for on-premise consumption of sandwiches from the back.A co-worker and I (she was the one who knew of Nottoli) stopped there on the way back to O'Hare. Two huge sandwiches, two drinks, chips, a side of marinated artichoke hearts, and a side of rainbow tortellini set us back $20. Not apiece. A single Jackson. My co-worker originally wanted to stop there because she always picks up some things to carry back to her home for herself and friends. This time, she picked up a lifetime supply of apple-sized olives for about $15.If you are flying out of O'Hare and want a decent place to grab a bite, this place is also blessed with great parking.

The only negative i would say, if this is a negative, and that is the majority of staff, and clients when i was there were mongolian. Thats fine. It just was uncomfortable at times as no one was speaking Enlgish. Then again, who cares.

It was about a foot long, so it would have been nice to have it cut in half. The chicken was pretty tough. The condiments (lettuce, tomato, and pickles) are wrapped separately from the sandwich. I understand why you did this, but you have to then peel the soggy bread away from the chicken to put on the condiments.Onion rings-These tasted okay. The mystery sauce that came with them wasn't good. Ranch would have been better. The sauce container had opened during delivery, and it spilled onto the plate and onion rings.Jalapeno poppers-These tasted good and came with ranch dressing.As a recommendation for the restaurant, you should consider adding a system where customers can provide their phone number when ordering, and you then have our address on file, so we don't have to provide it each time. That would have prevented this mess. I was pretty unhappy to receive food that wasn't hot after waiting an hour and a half for it.

I really hope that doesn't happen to this place!We visited again last Sunday for dinner and brought my sister with. It was a little more packed but service was still great. The wait surprisingly wasn't that long between orders. I think this is because they brought out rolls as they were ready (which I prefer), instead of trying to bring out a big tray of your entire order.

What I liked a lot is that after the first round they didn't start stuffing the sushi full of rice *cough, cough, Sushi Para II* and kept it pretty consistent with the rice to fish ratio.

Perhaps, she then assumed we didn't want pie, because I had to ask to place the order. She then takes off to pickup the check from the other table, (nice because you usually go to the register to pay)She comes back with the pie, my mom then asks for a glass of water with no ice, she comes back with a glass with ice, my mom wasn't going to say anything, but I piped up and said, \"mom, didn't you say no ice?\" she then replied yes. She comes back, drops off the water and the check, and tells us we can take it to the register. I look at the check and ask will they give her the senior discount up there?

Firstly, let me start by saying that my daughter, mother and myself frequent bakers square every Saturday, however this is our first time going to this specific location, store # 658. So if your a minority or specifically African American I wouldn't go here unless you want to get horrible service. Our dining experience started by the assistant manager attempting to seat us in the back near the restrooms, in which we noticed that's where the other African American patrons were sitting, I asked the assistant manager, do you have any seats over there (pointing to the bigger dining area), he looked at me as if annoyed and replied \"sure\" dryly. We didn't say anything about it we just continued on with our lunch. So our server whom is white comes and takes our order, he repeated our order 3 times to us. After waiting what seemed like an hour, we noticed our white server was asking all his other tables if they needed anything, bringing them their food, and being courteous as a waiter should. However, the server never came back to our table at all after taking our order. I saw the assistant manager walking pass and I asked him, do you know how much longer our food will be? He went to check and immediately brought it out to us, which further tells me the meal was ready, the server just didn't bring it to our table. My mother meal wasn't correct and we had no napkins during our entire meal. At this point I'm fed up, I spoke with the assistant manager and told him I think their is some racism going on here, in which I don't tolerate. I told the assistant manager that my mothers order was wrong and told him I wanted the check, store number, and to speak with the general manager. The assistant manager brought back everything I requested. Now, we're speaking with the general manager, I disclose to her all the above information and she's nice yet tries to make \u00a0it seem like racism wasn't the case and more so tried to blame the server as just being \"bad\" and not understanding the job. The general manager nearly begged us to pay for our meal however I politely declined and explained to her, I don't need a free meal, I insist that I pay for our meal and this is about the way in which we were treated and the poor service. I stated sternly once more that I don't want or need her to take care of our bills, she insisted we take a free pie, I accepted the pie to suffice her however I paid our dining bill for our meal. I told her that I would be calling corporate to complain, and informed her that we will not be back to this location again. She asked us to try that location again, I gracefully declined.

The reason I am reviewing this restaurant is because I have always had a wonderful server who is hospitable and such a sweet human being. His name is Angelo. Angelo has been working here for many, many years. He always has a smile on his face no matter what kind of day he has had. I am a huge fan of their salads. I enjoy their strawberry salad topped with warm chicken breast. They tend to change up the salads according to the Seasons, so I appreciate that they try \"new\" salads reflective of Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. If you enjoy eating salads, soups, sandwiches, and any kind of pie imaginable, give this restaurant a try. My favorite soup is butternut squash. Everyday they have a different \"soup\" of the day. Ask if Angelo is working and request to be seated in his section (area). I will give the service here (since I always get Angelo and always request him) five stars. He is excellent, attentive, welcoming and really good at his job. He always makes sure that you, the customer, are very well taken care of and if you need anything at all, he'll take good care of you. Please keep in mind that this is a franchise restaurant. Expectations should not be set high. Another excellent Server is Jeannie. She is always on top of her game, and will take really good care of you. She is filled with positive energy.They remodeled this restaurant several years ago. It looks more like a huge dining area with fewer booths. The booths always fill up quickly. Their salmon is always cooked perfectly and it is not a huge piece. It comes with steamed vegetables and your choice of salad and/or soup. The salmon is flavorful and juicy. I like that the texture on the outside is crispy, but the inside is tender and soft. There are different Managers here, so management is hit or miss at this Baker's Square. This restaurant is not culturally diverse as other restaurant that are in the inner city or in the heart of the city. However, the service is fairly decent, the price-point is very good, and the selection of pies are too many to list here. Every Wednesday is FREE pie Wednesday, so if you feel like breaking up your week and getting a FREE slice of pie, go for it. It can get fairly loud on Wednesday evenings, so expect it to be crowded and busy. My favorite pies are coconut cream, French apple cream cheese, strawberry and banana cream pie.

Before coming to Zip, I signed up at two other gyms. I hated it. I wasn't enjoying my workouts and the staff was not friendly. The gyms were also outdated and dirty.

WHO CAN BEAT THAT!What I like most about this gym is that I don't feel \"judged.\" Everyone is there to do the same thing. Since joining my first gym in Dec 2009, I have lost about 120 pounds. I am very excited to continue that journey at Zip Fitness. After reaching a goal weight, I plan to meet with a Gym Genius to see how the free weights and cable machines work. I have yet to try out that portion of the gym. They also have a 30 minute circuit training area (I did this briefly when I was at Curves and I enjoyed it).Some other pluses: The staff is very friendly. I am always greeted when I walk in and they always say goodnight when I walk out. The bathrooms are CLEAN. They are maintained and kept up properly. This is a huge benefit for me. There is nothing more disgusting than wads of hair in drains, dirty sinks/toilets, etc. This place still looks like it just opened. They have tanning available, but I have not tried that. I want to also comment on the \"younger/high school' crowd that I see here. Yes, at times, there are handfuls of young adults here. But they are ALWAYS working out. They aren't standing around socializing. They are on a machine running next to one another or lifting weights together. How can someone complain about that?

So working out in winter can get you brain freeze--if you're breathing heavy. Whereas summer can have you dripping wet, and trying to cool off anyway possible.There's always too many channels with sports on. Lately if you want to watch sports, news, hgtv, you'll be in luck every day. I guess you have to ask the staff to have something decent on, there is no permanent setup to what tv channels are on \u00a0which TVs.There seems to be some issues with maintenance, cleaning, and too much idle time of the staff. Some weight machines need lubrication and the hand holds on some need to be moved back to the correct position before they start breaking. The insides of the lockers continue to get dirtier week after week, the gentle cleaning to the showers could be more often, and the fabric floors(especially in the locker rooms) need a deep cleaning now and then. With sometimes three staff at the desk, all just talking, things could be better if they had more initiative.All kinds of people go here at all hours they are open, so no one is really out of place.

Back in Dec of 2009, I signed up at Fitness Premier in Melrose Park. I liked this gym because it wasn't as busy/crowded as Bally's and LA Fitness. That gym, however, closed in January of 2011. Before coming to Zip, I signed up at two other gyms. I hated it. I wasn't enjoying my workouts and the staff was not friendly. The gyms were also outdated and dirty. Zip Fitness is the complete opposite! I never worry about getting on a machine. They have a TON of treadmills and ellipticals. I love the amount of TV's they have, too. And $12.99 a month? WHO CAN BEAT THAT!What I like most about this gym is that I don't feel \"judged.\" Everyone is there to do the same thing. Since joining my first gym in Dec 2009, I have lost about 120 pounds. I am very excited to continue that journey at Zip Fitness. After reaching a goal weight, I plan to meet with a Gym Genius to see how the free weights and cable machines work. I have yet to try out that portion of the gym. They also have a 30 minute circuit training area (I did this briefly when I was at Curves and I enjoyed it).Some other pluses: The staff is very friendly. I am always greeted when I walk in and they always say goodnight when I walk out. The bathrooms are CLEAN. They are maintained and kept up properly. This is a huge benefit for me. There is nothing more disgusting than wads of hair in drains, dirty sinks/toilets, etc. This place still looks like it just opened. They have tanning available, but I have not tried that. I want to also comment on the \"younger/high school' crowd that I see here. Yes, at times, there are handfuls of young adults here. But they are ALWAYS working out. They aren't standing around socializing. They are on a machine running next to one another or lifting weights together. How can someone complain about that?

Ballys on Cumberland which is the next closer gym is always more crowded, more difficult parking, and more expensive. The only \"con\" for me is that the free weight section is quite as extensive as ballys. However, this also means there aren't as many meatheads around grunting while lifting. So it depends on what type of workout you are looking for. If you are looking for an affordable neighborhood place to do light lifting and cardio, this place is perfect. As a side note, I go most weekdays around 8pm and don't notice \"kids\" standing around talking. But quite frankly, I just got back from the gym and couldn't describe a single other person there.

After that we encounter the \"hostess\", she asked for our names and told us our name WASN'T THERE!!! But, I've work in restaurants, so maybe there was a mistake or confusion, I just expected an apology and our table, but no. The \"hostess\" told us she needed to talk to the manager, then came back and told us that the manager was busy but we could talk to the owner, we agreed; he appeared with a half way open shirt (seems odd for a restaurant owner, but that's none of my business). He told us that it is IMPOSSIBLE that I was confirmed because we didn't pay in advance. Well, if he had told me that when I spoke to him at midnightI would have made the payment, \u00a0 so I went to be nice and told him I was the person that called at midnight \u00a0(he answered at home), he insisted that tenths of people called him at midnight so I repeated my name, and I even played the voice message they left confirming my reservation. He insisted that it was IMPOSSIBLE, \u00a0and told me that the person who left the mesaage was busy at the bar. So, he \u00a0just justified the employee, whether is his wife, lover, or a random irresponsible, sb as him. As I wrote before, I've worked in restaurants most of my life.

I'm very respectful when I go to restaurants, I don't like the concept \"customers are always right\", because that's not always true, but if you have a customer that makes a reservation and you screw it up, at least admit it and apologize! Anyway, I believe things happen for a reason. They had 2 security officers (which where very nice), and after we left I was wondering if they have those security officers because they have had troubles before.

Of course we asked for a box, the check and left with no intention to return or either my friend who lives in the neighborhood.Management: After we have complained about the delay and asked for an explanation, the waitress has informed us the manager would personally come to talk to us; however it did not happen. The manager never came to the table, an explanation was not given, and not even a deduction was applied to the bill, as a courtesy for our trouble of having waited for over 90 minutes for a dinner plate.Price: Be careful when ordering soda: There is NO free refill, l and each glass cost 3 bucks (I mean each 1/2 glass, because the other half is just ice).

I got a haircut and highlights from Joanne. I really love my hair! I originally wanted to dye my hair light brown. My natural hair color is black. Joanne suggested getting caramel highlights instead, to make it not such a drastic change. I am so thankful and happy that I followed her advice. I am truly satisfied! Plus I got a free shine application with my highlights as part of their Moving Special. Perfect score to Lamaris Salon. Yay!I also like their Waxing Service. I got my brow wax from Laura 2 times already. The first time I came in, she told me not to pluck my brows for 3 weeks. She wanted them to fill in and grow a little bit, so she can better shape it next time. I tried to shape my brows a month ago and it was not nice. Hahaha! I guess I have to leave it to the professionals. I originally asked if I should come back every 2 weeks, but instead she said to wait for 3 weeks. I was impressed that she just did not say yes, so I can come back more often and therefore spend more money. I felt that she really cares for what is best for clients. Kudos to Laura! She is very good and very gentle. She uses wax for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and did not have any reaction to the wax. My brows were beautifully shaped and more even!!! Again, perfect score to Lamaris Salon.Last but not the least, manicure and pedicure. I had a no chip manicure 2 weeks ago and it is still intact and nice up to the present. It is supposed to last for 3 weeks. My pedicure is still nice, no problems at all. My nail lady, Linda is very nice and chatty. She just makes me feel comfortable and relaxed there. They now have a new massage chair! It's pretty cool! It massages your back, even your bottom! Hahaha! It feels kinda weird at first. Anyways, going back to my nails review, Linda was very knowledgeable about the process and was able to explain to me how the no chip manicure works. I gouged my index finger nail right after I was done. I was trying to get my keys out of my pocket. She had to soak it first while wrapping my finger in an Aluminum foil, then she had to redo the whole process for one nail again.

I wanted to try a new place; I've been to Trim a couple of times, but they don't knock my socks off.I'm from the west coast. In Oregon, I paid $10-12 for a wax; half that if I went to the beauty school. While at school in California, I went to a place that charged $8 for brows. I thought it would be impossible to find a place for brow waxing in Chicagoland that was less than $17 with a good reputation and service.I did a google search and decided to give this place a try on my way home from the suburbs today. Living in West Ridge, this place is only about 15-20 minutes from my house, which is about how long it takes me to get to the place in Lincoln Park that I go - except there's free parking, and plenty of it.Best of all - the girl who did my brows, Laura, did a fantastic job. I called around 4:10 and they were able to get me in at 4:30; the shop closes at 5 pm on Saturday. Laura was extremely thorough and really listened to what I asked her to do (which usually doesn't happen; I even had one woman recently tell me that it wasn't possible). She was very patient; I felt she was truly concerned with making sure it turned out well and that I was happy with her work, rather than just getting me out quickly and getting her cash. She asked me to please not leave unless I was truly happy with how they looked; she also checked with me about how I liked them a couple times during the process, which was a nice change. Of course anyone who does your brows asks how it looks - but that's when s/he is pretty much done. She was also extremely friendly, as was the other salon employee who was there.I can't end my review without mentioning what a fantastic bargain it was. The cost was $8 for my brows. Allow me to say that I don't believe I have ever left a place after having my brows done and was as happy with them as I was this evening. I think they look great!

The reason why I would have subtracted a star would be because I went in with my mom who had the same GrouponNow deal. The deal was for a facial and brow waxing. I went first and my mom had to wait since Diana was the only one there doing facials. When I was done with my facial, I asked Diana who would be doing my brows. She then sent me to a young lady that threaded them. The deal was for waxing, but threading was better for me, so no complaints. Afterwards, I was asked about form of payment for the brows. I had to remind them that it was included. Then young threading lady left the shop. I sat to wait for my mom. Once she was done, I once again had to ask who was going to do her brows. Diana looked around (I'm guessing for the lady that left), then said she would do my moms brows. I'm not sure if this was part of Diana's job description, but she handled the situation nicely.The jist of this is: I would return, mostly to give Diana my business because she was so personable.

I guess I have to leave it to the professionals. I originally asked if I should come back every 2 weeks, but instead she said to wait for 3 weeks. I was impressed that she just did not say yes, so I can come back more often and therefore spend more money. I felt that she really cares for what is best for clients. Kudos to Laura! She is very good and very gentle. She uses wax for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and did not have any reaction to the wax. My brows were beautifully shaped and more even!!!

What annoyed me was the amount of beers they did not have i stock. But whatever I am here to just watch the game. i order the Lagunitas IPA on draft. She came back about 15 minutes later and dropped off all the drinks. We were hungry and decided to order some food and this is where it got interesting.I order a burger, my friend ordered a sloppy joe and chicken tacos. Since it was really busy I did not expect to see my food for another 30 minutes to be fair. But when the food came out I was missing a few things. My burger was suppose to have lettuce, onion and tomatoes. It only had lettuce. A server should always come back to check on their guests the moment they get their food not 15 minutes later. Anyways I ask for my onions and lettuce and a side of BBQ sauce. She comes back 10 minutes later with ketchup and tomatoes and more lettuce. I wasn't trying to have anything ruin the Stanley Cup final so I gave in and just ate my food. My friend's chicken tacos was so salty it was unbearable to eat. I mean I have had salty tacos but you'd think that flavor would cancel out after lettuce, sour cream and etc poured on top of it. After we ate we pretty much just continued to drink till the game was over.When the Hawks won we just closed out our check and headed out because the fun was over.

IStarted off alright, my firends and I were in Saturday around noon and sat at the bar. There was maybe 3 other tables. Our bartender was friendly at first, got our drinks and took our food order. We order an app and soups with our meals. It took almost an hour for our soups to even come out. My 3 friends got their meals before my boyfriend and I even got our soups. We never got our app and finally when our food came out (I ordered a BLT by the way, should never take that long to make a BLT) I said something about how it was almost an hour before we got our food and the bartender told me I was wrong and it was only 35 minutes. It may have been only 35 minutes until our friends got their food but my boyfriend and I waited almost another 15 minutes for our food. She claimed that the 3 other tables and us at the bar all put our food orders in at the same time and they only had 1 cook which I don't really find as a good excuse. To make matters worse the bartender then just sort of gave up on us. She stopped coming by to see how we were doing, check our drinks. It was like she knew she messed up and didn't think we deserved any more of her time since she thought her tip was already basically gone. We did still tip her 15% even though she didn't deserve it.

Also I think domestic canned beers are only $3 that night too.However, the reason this is a 3-star is because service can be really slow. They often seem under-staffed.

I would strongly recommend avoiding this place like the plague. I have been a regular of Mo Dailey's for several years, as I attend Karaoke night on Fridays. While I love the karaoke there, I need to let people know what happened to me this past Friday. I went there with my husband for a drink and karaoke. Well on Saturday morning when I got home, I noticed that my debit card was missing. My wallet has a zipper around it, so there is no way that it would have just fallen out. This means that someone stole it, or it was accidentally left behind at the bar. I called the bar twice in the afternoon to see if it was returned, and was told it was not. No one however offered to take my name or number in the event that it was returned. Later that evening, when checking my bank account, I noticed an unauthorized charge at a bar down the street. The charge took place at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. I then called the bar back to let them know that my card had been stolen there as a courtesy, so that they could be on alert as people could also be stealing from inside the restaurant. It was a courtesy. I was calm and kind about it. Well, the response I got was far from a thank you. The person who answered the phone, who I believe was the owner yelled at me and said you're card wasn't stolen, it was returned back here this evening. The person who returned it said that you had dropped the card and was continuing to go off on me and accusing me of things that weren't true. This was beyond unprofessional. First of all, the card was probably returned because the person who stole it couldn't use it anymore. In addition, if had been dropped, why wouldn't they have just brought it back in on Friday night instead of waiting 24 hours to go back to the bar? Again very suspicious.Since I was unable to get anywhere with them on the phone, I then went to their web site and posted what had happened. Again, I got a very defensive response and was told that would never happen in their establishment. Again, explain to me how I had my card at midnight in a zipped wallet and by 2:30 a.m. there was an unauthorized charge at a bar down the street? In addition, the owner removed my comments from their Facebook page.I then got a phone call from the owner basically apologizing, but also still blaming me, and again reiterating that it didn't get stolen because someone returned my card. They also said that they earlier in the night had cut up my card. Um, why on earth would you do that, instead of locking it somewhere and giving the patron at least 48 hours to contact the bar? They also said that no one had contacted the bar earlier that day to ask about a lost card, which again was NOT TRUE!! I have been a regular for a long time, and have kept my mouth shut for too long. In addition to the rude manager who yelled at a regular, I have experienced repeatedly slow service, understaffed service, rude and pushy servers, wrong orders, drug deals by employees in the bathroom, and employees smoking outside while I am waiting for my food (which really seems unsanitary). Since I was a regular, and I enjoyed karaoke, I let it go, but not anymore. In addition, I have noticed that most of the servers aren't there for very long which should have told me something about the management from day 1. I am sure that the manager will give a defensive response to this at some point, but honestly that just proves that they aren't confident in what they are doing, and that they are not open to true feedback from their regulars, AKA the people who keep the business alive. All I had wanted to hear initially was a thank you for letting us know that, we will look into that, but instead I got an attitude, yelled at and a fake apology.

The first time went just fine - we sat at the bar and got served right away. The second time was a complete DISASTER.My fiance and I met up with a couple of friends at the restaurant. We got there first and decided to get a table. As we stood in the doorway of the place, no one approached us, or even looked at us. After a couple minutes of standing there, we decided to find our own table amidst the other patrons (There honestly weren't that many). After sitting down, NO ONE APPROACHED US, even though the waitress walked past our table multiple times. Finally, we asked the bartender for a menu, and she said the waitress would be with us shortly.When our friends arrived, the waitress finally came to our table. We ordered our drinks, and 10 minutes later, she brings two of the four drinks to us (we would've gotten quicker service simply going to the bar 2 feet behind us), and tells us that they have run out of the beer we requested. Okay - so I order a Black and Tan, and we proceed to order our food. Over ten minutes later, she brings it to me, and it's a glass of straight Guinness that tastes like it was sitting in the backroom for days. Whatever, I won't complain, I don't want spit in my food. Finally, over 20 minutes later (I don't know why we didn't just leave at this point), we receive our food. My fiance and I got cheeseburgers that were mushy and undercooked; my vegetarian friend ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad but told them she didn't want the chicken, so what did they give her? The chicken... And her boyfriend ordered Fish and Chips and ended up with a Fish sandwich. Seriously??? We tell the waitress that our orders were incorrect, and she says \"Sorry, they are having problems in the kitchen.\" She then says the manager will comp the Fish and Chips since it was completely the wrong order. My friend had to WALK UP TO HER to get the check because she literally avoided our table, and the check did NOT comp anything. We approached an older bartender to ask us for help and she told us that she \"can't do anything, go talk to a manager.\" That was the last straw.

I can't stand that. For one, it interrupts my relaxation and second, it washes all the lotion off. I find myself grabbing lotion on as soon as I get home because my hands are dry. The exceptional nail salons use a wet cloth and polish remover to get the lotion off just your nails, leaving your hands feeling soft and silky and smelling yummy.

I don't get pedicures or manicures very often (but I take good care of my nails-they are very short, so the manicurist doesn't really have to do a lot), so my boyfriend and I saw the positive reviews & decided to treat ourselves, and being that we were in this area of Chicago, we went here. My boyfriend got his toenails painted, and I got a pedicure & manicure. All in all we paid about $60 for services, and $11 in tip. Pros: Ladies were kind, courteous, nice massage chairs, good selection of polish, cool airCons: Only 1: They do NOT have nail dryers, they have these cheapie 3 inch mini fans that they sell at dollar stores, so you have to sit with your toes curled up off the floor and your hands in claw like positions to get your nails to dry. \u00a0And you just sit there and sit there, and finally 16 minutes later (yes I timed it), I ask my worker--Can I go? And she didn't even check my nails and yes. So my bf pays (because I know not to dip my hands in my purse), and we walk out the door and I carefully \u00a0open the car door and my pointer finger smudges immediately! So I go back in there and ask if they can fix it...My lady says: \"What did you do? You not supposed to touch anything when you leave here.\" Um REALLY? I think you are wrong. So instead of fixing it, she kind of smooths it over and adds more polish to it. I sit again for 9minutes this time--and then my lady comes over and says \"OK, you fine, \"and not even checking the hardness. I walk out of there, irked. I get home and 2 days later, my polish is flaking off. Do you know what kind of job I have? I type, copy and fax things. After 1 week my nails look like I work in construction.

I asked for their 3 inch breakfast sandwich on flatbread...he grabs the regular footlong bread when I correct him that I wanted the flat bread..he goes to the back and came back and threw the flatbread into the counter and continued on to angrily pile on the ingredients to make the sandwich...he was just very very rude and then when he charged me..I realized that he had made a 6 inch not a three inch...I normally wouldn't have cared for the mistake and paid the $1 difference but just because he was so grouchy and rude, I did dispute it and reminded him that it was HIS mistake not mine that he hadn't listened and started rushing through the process. Needless to say....there is no way I will be making a stop ever again to this particular subway store with this very disgruntled worker.", "rating": "1", "date": [2013, 5, 28]}, "6": {"description": "My review pretty much mirrors that of Cheryl's and Adri's. I stopped in here recently to grab a sandwich before work. The gentleman who was working just seemed disgruntled at the fact there was one customer coming into order. I felt as if I disturbed him by ordering here. He started making my sandwich and when he asked if I wanted it toasted, I said \"no\". Then he turns around immediately and throws it in the toaster. He was so unsocial and rude that I didn't argue the fact and paid so I could get to work on time. There was another time a friend and I had come in here late night (2-3am) to enjoy some late night sandwiches. As soon as we grabbed our food to sit down, the employee asked if we were really eating inside, to which we said yes. He said okay and walked away angrily. About 10 minutes in he says to us \"you guys need to finish in 10 minutes, I have to mop\". We felt pretty offended, but we said okay. Soon enough, he brings the mop out and starts mopping around us. So we understand that as the cue to leave. As long as this subway has this poor customer service and employees who are very rude, they have lost my business completely.

I had been going to a salon for 10 years and found it difficult to book an appointment with my guy for color because he lowered his hours. I was recommended to Dana. The first time Dana did my color she explained the color product she uses and why my former color was leaving my color brassy. She uses the best products and I can say that my hair has not looked at all brassy since. In fact my color had not looked this good since I went to an exensive place in Wicker Park nearly a decade ago. The color was so perfect I called her the next day to tell her how impressed I was that she was able to get it so right the first time. We are now talking about extensions as my hair is starting to thin a bit. She talked about a modified version where we would add fullness and the cost and time involved would be reasonable for me. So for technique and knowledge Dana is amazing.Let's talk about Dana herself. She is the person you want to spend an hour or two with(if you get cut, color and highlights like I did yesterday).

I just had to review since I know lots of people like myself that have a hard time finding a good salon. and because of prior bad experiences, I had not cut my hair in over 8 months. I moved back to my hometown Chicago from NY after 10 years so I was looking for a hair stylist to stick with. shortly after I moved back in spring of 2013, I had a bday party to attend and needed a cut badly. on short notice I stopped by the nearest chain hair cuttery. it's wasn't a bad cut necessarily but it wasn't a good one either. she missed trimming at least one layer. and she scolded me for having dry hair, doing keratin, and not cutting my hair every 6-8 weeks.fast forward to this past Friday. I read a few reviews and also wanted to stay within driving distance of Jefferson Park. so Aiyu peaked my interest. I was super nervous but as soon as I walked in Dana was so warm and inviting. the place is small but very neat and modern. she mentioned her training and education which did put me a little at ease.conversation flowed with Dana, but I never felt pressure to converse (sometimes I just want to read a magazine or play with my phone and not necessarily have an hour long convo while my hair is being done) (FYI: I'm an introvert). but I felt really comfortable. the wash was great, she conditioned my hair more because it was dry and needed lots of dead hair cut off. but she never once scolded me.she asked and actually listened for what I wanted. and I too asked her opinion on length to cut but she didn't go crazy cutting my hair all short. I wanted a cut but I still wanted my long hair. when she was done I admit I was a little surprised, it was probably the best cut I've had. all the dead hair was gone. my hair was still long, and it was shiny and soft and so flowy. my boss complemented me as soon as I walked in to the office yesterday.I'm loyal in that when I find good service (car shop, hair salon, etc.), I stick with them forever.

We were hoping to get a gel fill and saw that this particular salon offered the service (not all do). So we called ahead and asked if they would be able to take us in about 15-20 minutes and they said yes. We headed on over. When we arrived, it was noticeably busy with all the stations filled and other customers who were already waiting ahead of us. Based on the other Yelp reviews I saw in combination with this observation, I took this as a sign that they are probably a halfway decent nail salon. They clearly had the clientele to keep business rolling! So we added our names to the wait list and after about 10 minutes they asked me and my friend to have a seat at this nail bar/station area. Kinda unique with a display underneath the glass countertop with little flowers, sand and stones. A middle aged gentleman got started on my friend while I sat next to her. He made no indication that someone else would be coming over to work on me at any point in time. I began to realize he was going to be working on both of us. The majority of the time he was distracted, glancing at the TV behind him, greeting and talking to patrons walking in, talking to other technicians, etc. He paid such little attention that as he was sanding off/removing the previous coat of polish from the gel overlays, he left the drill on too long to the point where it was burning the actual nail bed. He did this to both my friend and I at numerous points during the session. We both pulled away and said \"ouch!\" And he said nothing. No apology or asked if we were alright. Throughout the appointment he was not gentle, ground away at my cuticles which are now cracking and are visibly irritated. He kept going back and forth between my friend and I until finally about halfway through another technician came over to me to finish -- or so I thought. She seemed confused as to where he left off, so just started making it up as she went along. I would mention certain things, like \"can you fix this?\" and she seemed irritated. Finally after she was finished I looked at the work and was it so awful and incomplete I asked to speak to the manager.I told her my cuticles hadn't been trimmed and they forgot to put a coat of polish on (I did French tips but they only put the white tip on but no pink layer. You could see the outgrowth from previous times I had my nails done.) I pointed out that they also hadn't cleaned out underneath the nail and everything just looked messy and unprofessional. She was able to fix most of the issues, but as she was working on my nails she would say \"Oh, so you like them short\" in a tone as if to imply I was making their job more difficult. She also went on to comment \"your skin is really dry\" -- umm... thanks? She said this in regards to cleaning up my cuticles to which she added \"next time you should get a manicure in addition to the gel fill\" and I said the place I usually go to does it automatically, I don't ask for it.

We were hoping to get a gel fill and saw that this particular salon offered the service (not all do). So we called ahead and asked if they would be able to take us in about 15-20 minutes and they said yes. We headed on over. When we arrived, it was noticeably busy with all the stations filled and other customers who were already waiting ahead of us. Based on the other Yelp reviews I saw in combination with this observation, I took this as a sign that they are probably a halfway decent nail salon. They clearly had the clientele to keep business rolling! So we added our names to the wait list and after about 10 minutes they asked me and my friend to have a seat at this nail bar/station area. Kinda unique with a display underneath the glass countertop with little flowers, sand and stones. A middle aged gentleman got started on my friend while I sat next to her. He made no indication that someone else would be coming over to work on me at any point in time. I began to realize he was going to be working on both of us. The majority of the time he was distracted, glancing at the TV behind him, greeting and talking to patrons walking in, talking to other technicians, etc. He paid such little attention that as he was sanding off/removing the previous coat of polish from the gel overlays, he left the drill on too long to the point where it was burning the actual nail bed. He did this to both my friend and I at numerous points during the session. We both pulled away and said \"ouch!\" And he said nothing. No apology or asked if we were alright. Throughout the appointment he was not gentle, ground away at my cuticles which are now cracking and are visibly irritated. He kept going back and forth between my friend and I until finally about halfway through another technician came over to me to finish -- or so I thought. She seemed confused as to where he left off, so just started making it up as she went along. I would mention certain things, like \"can you fix this?\" and she seemed irritated. Finally after she was finished I looked at the work and was it so awful and incomplete I asked to speak to the manager.I told her my cuticles hadn't been trimmed and they forgot to put a coat of polish on (I did French tips but they only put the white tip on but no pink layer. You could see the outgrowth from previous times I had my nails done.) I pointed out that they also hadn't cleaned out underneath the nail and everything just looked messy and unprofessional. She was able to fix most of the issues, but as she was working on my nails she would say \"Oh, so you like them short\" in a tone as if to imply I was making their job more difficult. She also went on to comment \"your skin is really dry\" -- umm... thanks? She said this in regards to cleaning up my cuticles to which she added \"next time you should get a manicure in addition to the gel fill\" and I said the place I usually go to does it automatically, I don't ask for it.

Booking: \u00a0I purchased the groupon in January and tried to get a hold of them in February to make an appointment I called them and emailed them multiple times and after over a dozen attempts I finally got a hold of them only to have them screw up my package. I never got a reminder call or email before my appointment either. Massage: \u00a0I asked for a deep tissue massage and this wasn't anywhere close. I've gotten dozens of massages in the past and this was by far the worst. They asked my if I had any trouble areas and I said yes and they proceeded to neglect those areas completely definitely not going back for that. Facial: this was ok. They did the usual steam and towel routine and asked if I wanted my clogged pores extracted..isn't that one of the points of a facial to begin with?? Also when applying the various products they never told me what the were or what they were suppose to do ( unlike other facials I received). Most likely wouldn't go back for that. Pedicure: this was also just ok. There was the usual foot bath but the water wasn't warm. They didn't really clip my nails or pumice my feet either. The polish selection was very limited but application was good. Also there was no massage during the pedicure either. Pass. Also they serve you champagne and chocolate covered strawberries during the pedicure and the strawberries were covered in Hershey's chocolate syrup not the hardened chocolate that is the norm, this made it very difficult to eat without making a mess. Time management: \u00a0nobody there seemed to know what order which service was coming next so they would put u in a very small waiting room while they sorted it out. Since I didn't wear a watch and I left my phone in my locker I didn't k ow what time it was but after I was finished with all my services I saw what time it was and it was way earlier than I expected which means that my services weren't as long as they were supposed to be :(Overall this place was a huge disappointment but I guess you get what you pay for.

When she styled it, it looked amazing - but when I got home, the cut requires a full blow-out every time I dry my hair. The color is keeping fantastically though!Now as for the salon.... the place is a logistical nightmare. Angela was working on three clients at once.

There's a big lot in back of the salon, though be careful where you park as many of the spots are reserved for some of the businesses there or the condos. The salon itself is hard to spot. It's is on the far north corner of the huge new condo complex on Northwest Highway, just a little north of Devon.Anyways, we got there about 15 minutes early. They said that was fine and pointed us in the direction of the changing room, where we changed into robes. It is one big room, which could be awkward if you are with a friend. They give you a locker to keep your clothes, purse, and shoes, which locks and you keep the key. We were ready for our first service.The facial/massage parts are separate. I was hoping it was more of a couples massage, but that is not the case. I decided to head to the massage room first. I was very much taken aback that there was one massage therapist who was male. I've gotten a number of massages before, and this was the first time I was given an option. The massage itself was adequate, but I didn't enjoy it as much.Next for me came the facial. Again, it was adequate, but nothing fancy. I've definitely had better elsewhere. My face came out feeling soft, but it only lasted for about a day. They did use hot stones, which felt nice. They might want to do something about soundproofing though. I could hear EVERYTHING going on outside the room.Finally, we enjoyed a pedicure together. The nail polish color selection was not the best, with only a few Essie polishes. The pedicure felt rushed to me. For example, they started using the buffer on my foot after it had been soaking for less than 2 minutes. Because of that, my feet weren't as smooth as they normally are after a pedi. The nail polish itself does look good though - no chips or smudges.Overall, it was an OK experience, and you can't really go too wrong with $49.50 for 3 salon services.

There weren't a lot of people there when we were there, so it wasn't too busy, but I felt like everyone was just trying to get their service done so they could get to the next person.

After several attempts to schedule the appointment, I gave up. I sent emails through their website, called and left messages....I felt ignored. I figured I'd just use the value that I paid for and get some services done when the time would come that I would need them. Fast forward to last week, May 2013. It was so much easier to schedule an appointment now that I wasn't using a \"Groupon\" even though I was using the value of it. I had a special event that evening and scheduled a manicure, pedicure and hair wash, blow dry and style for the event. Manicure/Pedicure: This went well. I'd give the girls 4/5 stars. It was a typical service you'd get anywhere. Nothing above and beyond, but it was nice and they did a good job. Not sure I'd come back since it was pricier than I usually pay for these services, but I needed to use up my Groupon value. Hair Job: WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! First off some background.....I had just had my hair highlighted about one week before this appointment, so it was a little fragile. I let the hair stylist know this before he started. My hair is fairly long, not too think or thin. I wanted/asked for a hairstyle to wear my hair down with some waves and a little volume. It started bad with the hair wash. The stylist shampooed it extensively and TWICE!!!! While shampooing it, he would mush it all up creating the worst tangle ever. Any experienced stylist should know better than to do that. And with the recent highlighting, my hair was fairly dry. It did not need two shampoos. What should have followed was a good conditioning...but NO. I got barely any conditioner and it was almost immediately rinsed out. After the shampoo, no hair product was used at all. He proceeded to comb out my hair, taking handfuls of hair with it from the mess that was made during the shampoo. Then the styling.....OMG.....I've never seen hair done this way. NOT EVER!!! My hair was partially dried to start off with. That's normal. The stylist was using a normal round bristle brush to dry it and get some volume...still normal. Then it began. He would dry a section of my hair with the roller brush...then wrap my hair around the brush until it was tight, and left the brush hanging from my head, with my hair wrapped around it. SERIOUSLY!!! I could literally feel it tearing at my scalp. Then he'd grab another round brush and do it again. At one time I had three brushes hanging from my head. Then he went back to the first brush, took my hair out, wrapped it around his fingers and used a bobby pin to pin the 'curl' to my head. To top it off....the bobby pins he used.....they were ones that I had just removed from my hair from how it was styled when I walked in. Does this salon not provide their stylist's with their own tools? The bobby pins weren't even holding well because they were stretched out from my use. This went on with my whole head. Hair brushes hanging, wrapping my hair around his fingers and then just bobby pins. At least he used some hairspray, which was all that was used that seemed normal. While my hair 'set', I changed clothes then went back to get the final style. The curls that were removed were not curls and hardly even waves. He then proceeded to tease my hair for some volume. My hair really didn't need that abuse after everything else. He also proceeds to tell me how damaged my hair is. NO S$!T SHERLOCK after what you just did to it. I take good care of my hair even with the coloring I do. He should know how to handle it. After a few more minutes of teasing, hair spray, etc, all I could do was grin and bear it and get the hell out of there as fast as possible. FINAL: To top it off.....I was charged the highest rate on the hair stylist.....the rate of an \"Artistic Director.\" If that guy is their \"Artistic Director,\" they have some serious issues. Who knows what a normal entry level stylist would have done to my hair? I ended up not using the whole value of my groupon and they wanted to issue me a gift card for the remaining value. Thank goodness I saw the Fine Print that said I can use the value toward goods or services. I used the leftover amount to buy some products they sell. At least they can't mess that one up.Conclusion: Don't get a Groupon. Don't use their hair services.

Being that I am beyond this scene of life, I taste the food for what it is... Absolute crap. I got a quesadilla and a taco yesterday accompanied by a large Horchata. The quesadilla was bigger than I expected it to be, very greasy of course just the same. The taco was really decked out and full of all kinds of good stuff. The Horchata lacked a cinnamon essence leaving me wish that I had a bottle of cinnamon at my access. Outside of the food, they're always nutty people lurking around the place, nothing against them, it is just a little weird seeing a guy do over a dozen laps around the lobby muttering random sorts of things that no one can understand. Oh and I can't forget to mention the fact that the heat was broken and it was 6\u00b0 outside. The place felt like an icebox and you could easily see the breath coming out of your mouth. Again like I said though, if you're young and out having a good time getting ripped his crap, none of this stuff probably would've phased you. The food probably would tasted great. The speaking in random tongues probably would've been amusing. The fact that there was no heat wouldn't have made a difference because you would've been so warm with all the alcohol you drink.

Believe it or not, outside of Taco Bell, this was my first introduction to Mexican food back in the mid 90's. I used to be in this neighborhood (even though I lived in the burbs) almost 3-4 times a week with friends, so we used to frequent everything on Higgins (which actually included a lot of Wendy's). Lately, I've had a chance to go back and noticed they've redone the place quite nicely. I never knew there was this much space in there before! I kinda missed the old ghetto look, though. Ah, nostalgia!SUPER KING BURRITOThe only reason this is famous is because of its ridiculous size! TBK serves food on oval shaped plates, and this burrito overshoots the plate longways on both sides! On top of that, the height of this is about as tall as a Big Mac! During my sophomore/junior year of high school days, I was able to take this down, but I can't even imagine doing that now! Funny story, one of my friends, who was this tiny girl, actually ordered the Super King. We actually both ordered it, and she finished this before I did! Not to mention, I was surprised at how clean her plate was. Mine was like a soupy mess! The burrito has meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream, and maybe some other things too. I guess this is an Americanized burrito. I know sour cream is uber diet fail, but I gotta tell ya, the sour cream is kinda what held this burrito together, tastewise. There's no butter here, at least I don't think, but the only way I can describe the taste is...buttery! And it has a lot to do with the sour cream, carne asada, and flour tortilla. HORCHATAI order an horchata from every single Mexican restaurant I've gone to, since I discovered TBK. Not only because I like horchatas, but also I want to compare that with TBK's. I believe that TBK has the best horchatas in the country! I've been to countless Mexican joints in Chicagoland, and I've been to a few in LA, including King Taco, and TBK has the best horchata. People look at me funny when I say this, but some places experiment too much with the cinnamon, and they end up with something that tastes like how Old Spice after shave smells! Not TBK! Theirs is sweet, milky, and just the perfect balance of sweet and spice. The spice never tickles your throat, it's there, but without a trace. MMmmmm! STEAK QUESADILLAThis used to be my favorite back in the day, but I had it recently, and it's not all that it used to be...that or my taste buds have changed. The thing I remember loving was how the steak had such a great smoky and beefy flavor to it, and it harmonized so well with the cheese and tortilla, but now, the steak isn't as prominent. It's just a more chewy cheese quesadilla. Ok, that's a little too rough. But honestly, the steak's flavor has been diminished quite a bit from what I remember.SUPER NACHOSAh, always faithful nachos with steak. They put cheese (I don't remember if it was nacho or melted cheddar), sour cream, lettuce, tomato, guac, and steak. But the main event, is the pickled jalapeno slices. It doesn't look like a lot of food when they hand you the togo styrofoam container, but even as you pick it up, it's just incredibly dense. Then you open the lid, and you see it's just packed to the top with chips and....stuff. I remember not being too thrilled about the cheese. It wasn't bad, it was just, the least performing of the other flavors. Even so, altogether, the nachos performed very well. When all the flavors combine, you get a pretty harmonious balance, but the jalapeno slices with every bite is what makes this a winner. The steak, again, used to be a lot more prominent, but now it's just \"a face in the crowd.\" TAMALEI've been on a tamale trip lately. I want to know what a great tamale is, so I order them wherever I see 'em. TBK seemed like the perfect place to try one, and theirs was really weird. It was a lot stronger on flavor than most, and the masa taste was hard to find. Strangely, I tasted rosemary! It was one of those things where I took a bite and was like, \"Bleh!\" But then I was compelled to take another bite and was like, \"Bleh!\" But then I was compelled to take another bite and was like, \"Hm.\" And that's the end. It ended at \"Hm.\" I'm not eager to try it again. I like the masa in my tamales, and here it was overrun.TACOSI tried steak and chicken, with onion & cilantro, and neither were really impressive. The meat was pretty bland on both accounts, so it was a very \"on par\" experience.TBKONTINUED?I'll always go to TBK if I get the chance...for the Horchata...and something to accommodate the horchata with. It's sad that some of the food has changed a bit (or my taste buds), but at least one thing stayed the same!

Twenty dollars, to buy me off? That's your solution, for a first-time customer? Listen, \u00a0I can absolutely understand if an order doesn't get immediately processed because of a busy dinner rush. It happens, everywhere, I totally sympathize. I can see where it could take an extra fifteen minutes to be processed. Maybe a half hour. Forty-five minutes, even. Hell, even an hour, at this point, I get it... but over two hours?What if I hadn't called GrubHub to get the status of my order.How much longer would I have waited..Apparently Blaze-N-Grill's open 'til midnight, on a Saturday night.Would I have gotten a knock at my door at twelve thirty in the morning, by some delivery guy with my order in his left hand and a twenty dollar gift certificate in his right hand, while he practices a verbal apology that truly had nothing to do with him, in the first place?.. well.. needless to say, I asked GrubHub to decline Blaze-N-Grill's amateur attempt at Customer Service 101. While Blaze-N-Grill may very well have a quality menu, I will never know this to be true, as tonight would've been my first order, and after an experience like this, I don't care to give the place another chance at repeating the same sequence of events as tonight's display of how not to operate.Oh, and.. after completing my final phone call with GrubHub, I threw on a jacket, took a seven minute drive to a different restaurant, placed the same order as I did at Blaze-N-Grill, and was back at my front doorstep within thirty minutes.Thirty minutes, ladies & gentlemen.... but now, a conclusion:To any restaurant wanting to succeed:If you're gonna partner with a service like GrubHub, be sure you're able to follow through with the process. A bigger online ordering presence means nothing if the online orders sit motionless & unnoticed until someone working at your restaurant suddenly remembers that you do, in fact, partner with an online ordering service.Blaze-N-Grill will never again be a dining choice of mine.I hope this review goes noticed, appreciated and helpful to the consumer, as well as the business. \u00a0Thank you for your time.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 1, 24]}, "40": {"description": "Went for lunch with coworkers \u00a0had the italian beef was very very delicious \u00a0but there wasnt much meat on it was mostly bread but everyone \u00a0i know who ate hete loves it im gonna go back and try it \u00a0again and there \u00a0very resonable to", "rating": "5", "date": [2015, 3, 27]}, "53": {"description": "First off, I must say the service at this place was exceptionally friendly.

I ordered it medium, and got it burnt to hell--a little meat hockey puck. It also had this strange flavor that I can't describe, as if the burger retained the taste of something that had been grilled right before it. The cheese was akin to nacho cheese and unevenly spread at that. I liked that they used romaine instead of iceberg lettuce, but that was the only good part of the burger. I would recommend avoiding the burgers at this place, unless you like your buns injected with disappointment. Some people are into that, so to each his own.The salad was supposed to come with garlic bread, didn't get it.

However it wasn't a week later before that joy turned to sadness. I am editing my review years later because I simply forgot I had a yelp account and don't want to leave false reviews.I went into to get Pravana Vivid Coloring done. I wanted to do a blonde on top and a hot pink under. Alex was very nice and welcomed me in with out a problem. She did mention that they didn't really have any of the colors I wanted but they did have this deep pink. She informed me that it would look awful for me to do the top blond and under pink even thought my hair is this washed out brown color at the time. It took convincing but she talked me out of getting the blonde and pink and just getting the pink. I watched as she began to work on my hair. Placing foil down under the hair and only placing the bleach on the top part of the hair and then folding the rest up into the foil. She did this with every part of my hair that she was going to dye pink. When she washed that part out getting ready to put the dye in I could see the horrible sight of failed bleach orange about half way down the hair. This should have been a sign. She dyed it and didn't even dry it. She \"trimmed\" my hair and I paid $90 for my hair and another $60 or so for the special shampoo and conditioner. Now I understand that bright colors don't last long and I was following her instructions to the letter. This included cold showers. The color washed out almost with in a week. A friend of mine went to get hers done with blue and her hair turned green. She didn't properly divide the hair and the dye got on the rest of her hair so it looked like a spatter paint art project. I would never go to this location again to get my hair done.When i was there four people came in to get touch ups on their hair that had gotten done less than a week before.OVERPRICED. Alex again was very nice but I wish she hadn't talked me out of what i wanted to do. Prices are outrageous. It is a full service salon at least it was the last time I went. I was a walk in to that was a plus to this place.Pros: Nice staff, friendly. Informative. Full Service Salon. Easy to find location. High end products. Beautiful environment. Accepts walk ins.Cons: Over Priced, average cuts that are not worth the price. I want to say Lazy but i think this is a mean way to put it but it just seems like they just don't try.

A pack of Kraft salad dressing. The cannoli. I asked if it had crunch or was soft (shell) because prestuffed it gets soft. They assured me it was crunchy. It certainly was not.

It was clean and bright. I was a few minutes late (thanks rush hour traffic) so I went right into the treatment room. My therapist quickly introduced herself and got to work. It was a good massage. I feel like she had a very good understanding of anatomy/musculature. Some therapists feel a need to bludgeon you into a pulp, but she used smooth, medium-pressure. I don't know how to describe it except that it felt very accurate. She didn't chat with me too much, which I prefer. The cons: The music was at times really weird -- very synthetic -- which distracted me. I found it odd that there was no intake, no asking about specific needs or medical conditions.My massage was $65, which didn't feel like a rip off. It wasn't the best massage I've ever had, but it was far from the worst. I'd say this is a good choice if you live really close to it and like a straight-forward service-driven salon experience.

I have taken a few family members here as well for spa day celebrations for their birthdays, and they have always enjoyed themselves too. They also run a great Bears promotion, if they Bears win, they have $50 massges the next day. What a way to get me into the Bears. There are always Mother's Day promotions as well.

I would have preferred being able to sit and chat with my friend as we got our nails done, but they had to split us up. \u00a0(Not a big deal, and definitely not why I'm rating this place so low.) \u00a0I will say the place was nice and clean, and the masseuse was very polite and friendly. \u00a0The esthetician (whose name I'm incredibly frustrated that I can't remember) not so much, but I'll get there. \u00a0The facial was okay. \u00a0Not something I'd make a point to go back there for, but not bad. \u00a0My only caveat was having my nose and cheeks pinched and squeezed \"to get any extra oil that might be in there out\". \u00a0I'm pretty sure a Biore strip would have been sufficient. \u00a0My friend told me as we left she actually stopped the girl mid-pinching and told her to move on. \u00a0While my friend was getting her facial, I got my nails done. \u00a0As I mentioned, this was right before my wedding, and I wanted to make sure the nailpolish would hold up for the next two days (at the least). \u00a0Both my friend and I asked the esthetician for a no-chip manicure. \u00a0Here's where the trouble started. \u00a0The esthetician said they only had one no-chip topcoat, and carried on with the manicure. \u00a0Gentle is not a word that comes to mind, by the way. \u00a0I've had dozens of manicures before, and never once has anyone cut me. \u00a0This lady ripped my cuticles down so low I had dried blood under one cuticle bed for days. \u00a0When I noticed I was bleeding, I asked for something to wipe it off with and she just shrugged and said it would wash right off. \u00a0Initially, the manicure looked great. \u00a0Once my friend and I left, I didn't give it much more thought until the next day when I saw the polish on my nails was already cracked. \u00a0Not something one expects to see with a no-chip manicure less than 24 hours after it's done. \u00a0I only had the no-chip put on my hands, and today, nearly 3 weeks after, my toes still look like they were done yesterday. \u00a0I guess I should have skipped the topcoat, but with 2 kids at home, I didn't want to take the chance. \u00a0My friend had the same problem, and was furious. \u00a0She went back to the spa the following day before heading to our rehearsal. \u00a0She was coolly informed by the esthetician that the no-chip topcoat we asked for \"doesn't work with OPI\" but because we asked for it, she didn't say anything. \u00a0She wasn't surprised that the manicures already looked cracked and were starting to chip. \u00a0She told my friend that's \"just what happens when you use the wrong topcoat\". \u00a0And obviously, this is where my issue with the place stems from. \u00a0At no point did this esthetician inform either of us that the no-chip topcoat they had would not work with the OPI polish they had. Why they didn't have a no-chip topcoat that DOES work with OPI (since anywhere else I've been seems to), I don't exactly understand, but that's neither here nor there. \u00a0She also never offered an alternative. \u00a0And, as neither my friend or I are estheticians, how the **** should we know what works with what? \u00a0I'm always amazed-- and not in a good way-- at how some people screw up and blame the person on the receiving end of their mistake.No, nobody noticed my jacked up nails at my wedding. \u00a0Not even me, as I had such a wonderful time. \u00a0Afterward, however, I found I could not remove the polish with acetone, or anything for that matter. \u00a0I had to chip at it and scratch it off, which as any girl knows is not the best idea. \u00a0An added surprise? \u00a0My nails are stained from the polish (a first for me). \u00a0They'll grow out and so will the stain, I know, but for now I have coral-stained nails and no desire to return to Thee European Spa. \u00a0Ever.", "rating": "2", "date": [2012, 6, 5]}, "15": {"description": "The massage was one of the best I have ever received.

An employee informed us we \"probably wouldn't be finished eating by 9 pm\" at which point they were apparently prepared to kick us out for simply having a child dining with us.

We will never return to this business after that experience, and I hope the owner of this establishment reads this review to learn about how ridiculous his/her \"no kids\" policy is. Feel free to dine here in on date night, but if you bring your kids for the quesadillas, pizza, or mac and cheese on the menu, well F-off. We had friends visiting from out of town with their daughter and had just finished up watching Shakespeare in the Park at Wilson Park. We always had a good experience at The Garage Bar so we suggested we go there for dinner. We were a party of eight people. We have well behaved kids. We walked in the door just after 8:15 pm and the server who came to greet us at the door looked at the kids, gave us a disappointed look and said \"We have a policy that nobody under 21 is allowed in here after 9 pm.\"\"It's 8:15,\" we said. \"Yes, but you probably won't have time to eat your food by 9 p.m.,\" she said. \"And I'm worried I'll get in trouble.\"We looked around the bar. There were maybe three tables with people at them, and at least 8-10 tables open. It was about 25 percent full.\"But the place is nearly empty. Are you saying you don't want our business? We're going to order eight meals and drinks,\" we say.\"Sorry, that's our owner's policy. It's just this bar,\" she says, acknowledging the owners are apparently clueless. \"Nobody under 21 after 9 pm.\"\"Again, it's 8:15 pm,\" I said. \"Ok, I guess we won't be coming back here ever again.\"So, owner of The Garage Bar, you might want to revisit this \"no kids after 9 pm\" rule you have. While I can understand why you don't want kids in the place during late-night drinking hours, in this case we were TURNED AWAY AT 8:15 PM ... apparently because you'd have the waitress kick us out at precisely 9 pm whether we had finished our meal or not. Anyway, we went up the street to the Iron Horse Ale House on North Northwest Highway and had a great meal and good beer. Our meal took about an hour and we spent more than $120 there. Next time you're looking for a good meal on the NW side and (God forbid) have children with you, go to the Iron Horse Ale House instead. The Garage Bar is apparently doing so well that the owner has the luxury of refusing a party of eight on a Saturday night when the bar is almost completely empty. Good luck with that business plan, Garage Bar. You're going to do great in a neighborhood of families. I guess the empty tables on a Saturday should have told us what we needed to know. Jeff and Gladstone Park folks, don't bother with this place.***Please note the \"Shame on you\" attitude of this owner's response for bringing our family to dine at their establishment at 8:15 on a Saturday before the sun even set.

I have to lower my rating a star because when we were somewhat ready to pay and leave, we were asked to either move to another table, as there was a party of 7, and they wanted to use our table to Voltron and combine with another table. It's not like we were lingering and talking forever, but they wanted to accomadate others, I suppose.", "rating": "4", "date": [2015, 11, 3]}, "22": {"description": "Hands down the worst customer service that I have ever experienced and/or endured. For the moment that I walked in the front door with my family, it was immediately apparent that we were not wanted by the owners nor the bartender. \u00a0It's such a shame that a neighborhood bar AND restaurant would be so rude to its customers. I could never recommend this establishment to others.", "rating": "1", "date": [2015, 11, 14]}, "15": {"description": "Woah, ho ho!!! What a burger this was!My wife got the garage burger and I got the Thai chili chicken pizza. My pizza was good. A little too thin on the crust for my tastes. Additionally, if something has the word \"Thai\" in it, there should be a little zest to it. This had not. On to the basket of sweet potato fries. They were awesome and thick cut. I never knew sweet potato fries tasted this good with ketchup. At this size, I could try.Now, as for the garage burger. It was awesome. Best burger I've had in years. The bun was properly toasted, the egg perfectly fried, the cheese melted oh so delicious, and the burger cooked to perfection. They put avocado on it, which I'm at odds with. On one side, I love avocado. I mean, who doesn't? People that suck. That's who. But, when you have a gooey burger with a slippery layer of avocado on the bottom, it makes for some difficult eating. Hands down: get this burger. The chips they serve are spicy and delicious.As for the service, it was on par. The decor is awesome. They had some garage band-ish music. Oh, and free street parking.

I was nearby and hungry and thought I'd stop in.The food was good. I ordered one of the sandwiches and gobbled it up, along with the delicious sweet potato fries. I had the Sailor Jerry to drink, which was only $3.50 on special that night, and thought it was quite refreshing. They offer different food and drinks specials each night, and all sounded good. I regret not trying the wings - they looked good when the next table over had some brought to their table.Unfortunately, it was still a bit too cold for the rooftop to be open, but I will need to check it out soon.Service was quick and friendly.
