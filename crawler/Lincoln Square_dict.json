Don't go here and ESPECIALLY don't bring your kids here. I have to say, since I work out early mornings at Galter, I was excited for this location to open, but when I stopped in one morning after working out I was shocked at all of the things going on there.First, there was a manager training a new employee, which is fine and expected, but when the other employee (3 people total) was asking for some help with the growing line of customers [I was in], the manager would yell over to her that she was \"busy and to do get the bagels herself\". Having managed retail, I found that tacky and in poor judgement.Next, while I was standing and waiting for my 2 sandwiches, I listened to the music playing and was really disgusted at the lyrics to the song playing. I Shazaam'd it to find out it was a song called \"Deuces\" [Explicit Version] by Chris Brown. There was a LOT of profanity in the song, which I couldn't believe they were piping through their speakers at an Au Bon Pain.My sandwiches were presented to me, both incorrectly, but the lady working behind the counter nicely offered to remake them and I was okay with that since the Manager wasn't helping her at all anyhow. This was understandable, but the general quality of the food was terribly. Freshly cooked eggs that were then put into a drawer near the floor and 2 previously cooked egg \"discs\" were pulled out for my sandwiches. I understand the need for speed, but with 3 customers in line, 6 sandwiches to be made, and it's already taking 20 minutes to get me my food, please don't pull precooked egg discs out of a drawer bin that sits about 6 inches off the floor. Absolutely disgusting. People walk around and kick up water and debris all the time. I can't see this as a good place to keep precooked eggs or why even precook them in the first place.I finally received my 2 sandwiches and went to the checkout register to pay. The new hire there was very friendly and did a great job of asking me questions and ringing me up and thanking me for my visit. While this was going on, the manager was mopping up a broken bottle of juice that has spilled under the register. In the process she was mopping all over my feet and didn't say \"excuse me\" or anything about possibly moving so she could mop. So, I took my sandwiches and my wet shoes and left the store. I got to my care and started to bite into one of the sandwiches and it was like eating rubber surrounded by cardboard. It was an egg and bagel thin sandwich, but there was NO flavor to it and the textures were gross.This was on a Saturday and I tried to call the Au Bon Pain customer service phone number to complain (as I'd rather do that than go straight to Yelp with a complaint), but they were closed until Monday. I waited until Monday and called in the morning and left a message. I then called later on Monday afternoon and left another message. It is now Thursday morning and I have yet to receive a call back even though I have specifically stated in my voicemails that I had a terrible experience in this location and wanted someone to call me back fast because of several things that had gone wrong with my experience.I find is sad that this manager is in charge of 1. training new employees since she apparently has no patience and 2. this manager has no sense of decorum in dealing with customers and 3. she cannot seem to handle more than one thing at a time. I'm disgusted that Au Bon Pain lets the music played in their stores be of a sexually charged and profanely graphic nature. I feel very bad for the two employees that were working that day and hope that better jobs come along for them in the near future.I will NOT be setting foot in this or any other Au Bon Pain in the foreseeable future.

I ordered my food to go to try different ones and share it at home. I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage, candied bacon biscuit sandwich, a side order of bacon and one cinnamon roll! \u00a0Food was definitely good! Bacon was thick and has lot of meat, cinnamon roll was on point! I opened the paper cup that they had the gravy and sausage in and it smelled so good that I couldn't wait to eat that first, I searched the paper bag for the biscuit that came with it \u00a0but it was not there . I called them back and explained to them what happened and they apologize and I'm told that they will make it up with a certificate for a free breakfast next time I come in ! But I still want to eat biscuits and gravy sooo I had to adopt and overcome the situation by pouring the gravy over the candied bacon and biscuit to get my fix!

That being said, I was disappointed with my visit and I wish I liked it more. One problem was logistics, there was no overhead menu which is not very customer friendly, especially when it's unclear whether this is a restaurant, a cafe, counter service, etc. I was trying to figure out all this information and had like 20 seconds to make a blind decision with the paper menus they had at the register. Of course I felt rushed considering there was a line forming behind me, and all of this could have been avoided if there was an overhead menu or if the paper menu were more prominent as you walked in. \u00a0The second issue, and the main issue, is that the food wasn't that good. My wife and I ordered oatmeal, grits, and a cinnamon roll. The oatmeal was ok. Nothing phenomenal and nothing one can't make overnight at home with oats, milk, sugar and fruit. The grits were especially confusing. I've lived in the south so I have had some tasty grits in my day and they weren't executed well at Baker Miller. The grits were under-flavored as you ate them, but then all of the sudden at the very end of the bite there was this spicy kick that came from nowhere. Confused? So was I. But was it good or enjoyable? Nope. The best thing was the cinnamon roll, so if I ever get back to Baker Miller I would just order a pastry. But tellingly, I haven't been back after that one time and I'm unsure whether I will get back.", "rating": "3"}, "10": {"date": [2016, 2, 27], "description": "There are a lot of great items on the menu, but the humble Togarashi bagel is a favorite.", "rating": "4"}, "11": {"date": [2016, 3, 6], "description": "If you're looking for bland this is not your place.

Baker Miller spun off as an amicable split from one of my sweet tooth Chicago favorites, Logan Square's Bang Bang Pie Shop. According to the Internets, the husband-wife team, named Miller (natch) wanted to focus on craft and work closer to home. I respect that. The grain is milled in house, then baked into delicious sweets and snacks.I needed a coffee break and the wife wanted to try this new venture, so away we went. We snagged a couple pie slices--butterscotch for me and pumpkin for her--as a snack for a table of four. Two pie slices is plenty as a nibble, but if you want your own, I don't blame you. After seating, we noticed the jam and butter bar, as well as the toasters located on each table. That's also how we ended up ordering really good toast bread for $2 apiece. I mean, the in-store toasting a la Hampton Inn is worth the price of admission.The pies are, well, not as good as Bang Bang. Sorry, but I feel it to be true. They're certainly interesting. Butterscotch chip cookies from Tiff's Treats in Austin might be my favorite U.S. sweet dessert of all time (close tie with Goode Company's Pecan Pie). The pie filling isn't quite that good, but it was certainly tasty. My palette questioned the crust. I feel bad about it, since there was troublesome lengths to mill the grain in house. I mean, that's impressive. But it tasted, well, grainy. I want my crust to crumble well, stick a little, and meld into my pie. I don't want it to taste like I'm eating a whole wheat bun that tastes like toasted quinoa while I'm gorging myself on something that could cause the diabetus with one bite.Mini-rant aside, the place is uber-cute and will score you brownie points with a significant other. Or with the in-laws when you bring a pie back for Christmas dinner and get to tell the story of the husband-wife team making good.

Baker Miller was somewhere lost in the middle, and sadly, it'll probably also be lost from my mind. We came for brunch around 1ish on a Sunday and there were plenty of tables open but almost none of the brunch menu items were available. Yeah, sure, that makes sense. Especially when you're serving brunch for another two hours. There was a board near the cash register that lists the sold out items so the cashier doesn't have to disappoint you himself. This is a recap of my first five minutes at Baker Miller: Oooo the Fisherman looks good - glanced up at the sold out board. Ugh, damnit. Oh, here's a good one, the Millwright Sandwich. Really, I picked a sold out item again?! This happened with about two more menu items, so I asked the cashier what he would pick of the items that were available. It was basically between the Peachy Keen Sandwich and the Ploughman's given what they had in stock. He stated the Peachy Keen was one of his favorites, so I went for it. And I got a side of grits because as Texas girls, we lovee some grits.Walking to our table, my eyes fell in love with the butter/jam bar - thyme and sage butter, peach jam, cilantro lime butter, I couldn't wait to try them. And none of them disappointed. They were all so delicious, I was basically just eating butter at one point. When my Peachy Keen Sandwich came out, it looked delicious - an open sandwich with peach jam on one side and sausage and goat cheese on the other. However the rest of the plate looked a little plain - oh that's right it's supposed to come with greens. They must have forgot. I nicely asked the guy behind the counter if there were greens for my sandwich and he simply stated they were out of greens. WHAT?! You're out of greens? How is that even possible? I'm sorry, but as someone who works brunch at a restaurant, you should always know what to expect on a weekend and the approximate inventory that you'll need in stock. And if you do run out of something, you should substitute a side for something else. I asked if there was something I could get instead of the greens, they stated grits. I probably gave them a mean look because my plate is right in front of you and you can obviously see that I already ordered a side of grits. I asked if there was anything else, and he said, \"not really\" - I just walked back to my table disappointed and annoyed because my plate didn't come with a side and I paid an extra $4 for a side of grits that I could have gotten for free. I'm sorry, but that's also not proper customer service.The food itself was good, fine. The sandwich was pretty good and I would probably order it again, but I don't know that I would come back mainly because of the service and lack of brunch choices. Beware of those grits though - they are pretty much like cardboard.

Cherry Pies with cherries from Michigan and Strawberry Lemon Chiffon are amazing. A place that mill their own grains must have oatmeal and grits and they do them both very well.

I'd stop by once every few months because their pastry chef made such amazing treats. Turns out the pastry chef has quit. I found that out today when I was being barked at by the stern-faced lady behind the counter. Also, as an added note: they have a full room in which customers can sit and eat, but won't allow customers to use the bathroom!

Their menu rotates somewhat, but everything I've tried there is great (chilaquiles, biscuits & gravy, etc)! As a tip, you can also create your own \"standard\" breakfast by mixing and matching the side items. I often order a couple eggs, sausage, and toast from the sides menu a la carte, and the overall price is super reasonable. And when you order toast, they bring a mountain of it (like 6 half pieces of toast). Also, try the mimosas for an extra fun brunch. They are basically a glass of champagne with a splash of OJ, rather than the other way around. If not, their coffee is always fresh and tasty. I'm not as big of fan of the dinner options, mostly because I find them to be rather pricey. For instance, one time my boyfriend and I literally got soup & salad for dinner and somehow the bill came out to $70. WUT. We never run into this problem at brunch.

Not to blow my own horn, but Cake Bite Girls was the very first vendor I booked for my fall wedding last year, and arguably the best. (Aside from yelp.com/biz/jamie-lynn-\u2026, of course) I discovered CBG at a wedding expo and booked an appointment for wedding favor cake bites with the CBG herself a few weeks later. I brought my whole posse along, which was weird, because normally they were never available for wedding appointments... yet when the cake bite tasting appointment was made, suddenly they're all free/in town/giving Weight Watchers a break, etc. Anyway, CBG brought out pre-discussed samples for us to try and made us comfy in her SUPER posh office. Oh yeah. This place is baller with its white rug, shabby chic desk, ornate and feminine furniture and flowers everywhere. I want to pretend I'm a fashion mag exec in that room. The cake bites were beyond what we expected. We tried German chocolate, red velvet, vanilla and almond with assorted chocolate coatings and sprinkled toppings. All the flavors were fantastic, natch, but the richness of the cake mixed with the frosting was lush, decadent and nothing like what we expected. The cake bites will send you into sugar coma heaven and you'll be over the moon to be there, because you've never had anything like this. And no, this is so not that crap mix that you put into your Easy Bake Cake Pop contraption. Don't disrespect the cake bites and assume they are even remotely the same.I selected red velvet, almond and German chocolate for my flavors, and then naturally my bride brain took over and I changed my mind six thousand times. CBG is cool with that. In fact, she encourages it, because then she can create new and ridiculous tasty flavors like cinnamon apple with vanilla. Oh yeah. You better believe we traded out a flavor for the cinnamon apple, people. Here is the very best of the best part of CBG: the price. Any bridal book worth it's monogrammed napkins will tell you a wedding favor should cost anywhere from $3-7/person. Life. Cheat. I ordered 150 cake bites in three flavors, with pretzel handles, perfectly-sized cellophane bags and ribbon and the price came out to $2.50/person. And they were delicious. And people actually ate them and didn't leave them on the table. And there might have been minor scuffles over who got what flavor. Super success. I even honored my dad with his favorite flavor, German chocolate. Who doesn't love a subtle tribute? The story doesn't end with the wedding. CBG also hosts cake bite parties. That's right. She teaches you how to make her gorgeous confections from her special cake/frosting mix. I took the Halloween class and loved every sticky, sugary, minute of it. She showed us her spooky and ghoulish creations, and then we made pathetic stick figure renditions of them. Fabulously fun.

I was new to Chicago at the time but didn't expect much given the pretty half-assed attempts of a lot of Bosnian food I've encountered here in the United States. I've been just.. astounded sometimes to find Bosnians cooking their own cuisine, serving mostly their own countrymen, pretty much Americanized versions of the cuisine. I didn't think we'd yet reached the point of Americanized Mexican or Chinese franchise food served in a restaurant setting, but I sometimes began to question that.But when the zeljanica rolled out here, I was pleasantly surprised! It is hands-down the best zeljanica I've payed for in the States. Mom's home cooking is always the best, as we all know.. ;) but this place does it damn good.First of all, it was \"old school\" zeljanica, meaning it was not made with store-bought phyllo dough (which, not to discredit it, can be great but doesn't compare to the hand-rolled dough). Also, the portion was huge. I couldn't finish it in one sitting. I followed it, as you're supposed to, with kiseli jogurt (pretty much like plain keffir). It was delicious. The dough was perfectly crispy on the outside and the filling was nice and soft. I devoured my left overs later that night with noooo problem.Nowadays, I don't make it up to the cafe very much just because I don't live as close as I did back last fall. But I just took my boo there last Saturday to have him try the best burek and zeljanica I've yet found here.

I've been just.. astounded sometimes to find Bosnians cooking their own cuisine, serving mostly their own countrymen, pretty much Americanized versions of the cuisine. I didn't think we'd yet reached the point of Americanized Mexican or Chinese franchise food served in a restaurant setting, but I sometimes began to question that.But when the zeljanica rolled out here, I was pleasantly surprised! It is hands-down the best zeljanica I've payed for in the States. Mom's home cooking is always the best, as we all know.. ;) but this place does it damn good.First of all, it was \"old school\" zeljanica, meaning it was not made with store-bought phyllo dough (which, not to discredit it, can be great but doesn't compare to the hand-rolled dough). Also, the portion was huge. I couldn't finish it in one sitting. I followed it, as you're supposed to, with kiseli jogurt (pretty much like plain keffir). It was delicious. The dough was perfectly crispy on the outside and the filling was nice and soft. I devoured my left overs later that night with noooo problem.Nowadays, I don't make it up to the cafe very much just because I don't live as close as I did back last fall.

Satisfying, but if I'd rather try the kimchi soup next time. My mom's bibimbop on the other hand was disappointing \u00a0because they were skimpy on the meat and the rice was mushy.

Our server came to us multiple times (within a 5 minute span) to ask if were ready to place our order (after we had just gotten our drinks). Our brunch starters (donut + sticky bun) came just a few minutes before our actual entrees came. Would have been nice to just enjoy the sweets before the savory items came out -- we still had plates full of pastry on them and the servers tried to clear those out to make room for our entree plates.

It was 7 p.m. - we didn't have a reservation and we knew we'd likely have to wait. I walked in and a lovely lady took my information down and said it'd be about an hour. Sweet.We walked over to Daily and had a beer whilst waiting - which ended up only being about 30 minutes.A quick call informed us our spots were ready, so we ventured back across the street and were pleasantly surprised to be seated at the 'chef's bar.' Unlike a 'chef's table,' the 'chef's bar' is more like a small breakfast bar that seats 6 and you watch the magic in the kitchen right before your very eyes. It was so entertaining and the chefs/cooks were so sweet - on occasion explaining what they were doing and answering any questions we threw their way.But, beyond this fun spot and great people working at this establishment, the food. Oh my God, the food.We ordered a number of sharing plates: whipped ricotta, crispy cauliflower, crispy brussels sprouts, garlic soup and the butternut squash gnocchi. I don't know what was better - there is no 'ranking' here; it was all memorable. Flavors tucked into tiny crevasses, butter and lemon through the brussels leaves, pillows of gnocchi with a delightful sauce, an amazing soup with crunchy garlic.

Then she took forever to greet us cause tje person who came after us had a reservation really u told us no available ones work on this everybody loved this place! BE CAREFUL THERES A PARKING AREA RIGHT BY THE RESTAURANT DONT PUSH THE MAX BUTTON DO IT BY THE HOUR WE PUSHED MAX N IT CHARGED US 24$$9 Brussel sprouts: if u dont like Brussel sprouts this dish will make u love them. The brussel sprouts are fried to perfection not greasy or burnt so crunchy! Then theres bonito flakes n their not old so they werent dry which they can be it added a nice seafood flavor to the dish that went perfect with the brussel sprouts. The sauce is to die for its so rich! Plz put more though ask for more sauce its orgasmic. Then the pistachios were amaizin!! They have this amaizin coating on them idk what it is there amaiZin this dish was a homerun i would come back just for this dish$11 Burrata:the burrata was amaizin n it was actually seasoned! I hate grape fruit like i do with a passion people hate cilantro well grape fruit is my cilantro. Its sweet acidic flavor made the salad taste so much better. The argula tasted really good alot of times it has a really funky bitter taste thats really awful but its really high quality. The vinaigrette was really tasty it wasnt to acidic sometimes they could be way to acidic. The best part of the dish are these garlic fritters! Omg omg fuck croutons garlic fritters are in they taste so good and rich and are so crunchy ask for more cause they only give u two pieces u will thank me$10 Butternut squash gnocchi: amaizin! Im always hesitant to order this cause the texture is off n there not flavorful these were amaizin. They were so fluffy like pillows. N they taste so good so flavorful not bland at all. the puree was delicious butternut squash is so underutilized. It has such a rich delicate flavor. The brown butter is so rich butter makes everything taste better put more plz the best part is the amaretti cookie the sweat tone is so amaizin i never had a cookie in an appetizer before its heavenly it goes so well with everythin else put more plz must order!$23 Sturgeon: this was one of the best dishes of the night order it! The fish is crunchy yes! But a lil overcooked. The risotto was amaizin so rich perfect texture! I wanted to eat a bowl of just this. Then theres pork in it! What could be better then rich salty pork! Then theres collard greens omg best ones i ever had this dish was amaizin im definitely comin back jus to eat this again. Then theres spicy pickled onions imma be dreamin about this dish$23 grilled sirloin: this was good but not amqizin like everybody else. The sirloin was cooked perfectly n seasoned nicely. Problems not enough components after about a minute ur left with a bunch of steak. Panisse was interesting picture like healthy fries a nice texture. I loved all the texture in this dish like the cashews. The best is the fried broccoli amaizin! The puree is phenominal but put more!$9 Brownie: (be warned the plate and brownie are extremely hot) i usually dont care for brownies but this was amaizin the ice cream was to die for! Idk what flavor it was cause theres no dessert menu but its phenomenal perfect texture went perfectly with the brownie. Then theres macadamia nuts so crunchy this dish needed the crunch! Omg then theres pretzel bites so good! I love sweet and salty its the best flavor combination! N all these crunchy elements really elevated the dish! The brownie was perfect no dark chocolate really this was so decedent. Their was this orange flavor that went perfectly with the chocolate n cut through the sweatness a must order $9 Apple fritters: omg the fritters are so big! Their like as big as oranges. Their so flavorful n theres actual pieces of apple in it so u could really taste the apple fritter. It wasnt dry at all. Their not greasy but they were a lil dark. The ice cream omg nothing better then homemade vanilla icecream! Wish there was vanilla bean in it but still amaIzin! Theres a caramel sauce thats really delicous but theres not enough!

She was polite, attentive, knowledgeable, and great at communication. Ok. Now onto the food! We started with the mussels and holy moley they were delectable. Perfection. Then we both ordered the sturgeon. My life has been forever changed. No other fish dish will ever come close. It was so much more than a fish, it was insanely flavorful and with all of the little additions of ingredients along side it really made Gather stand out. For dessert I had the sorbet medley. I have a dairy allergy which throughout the entire meal wasn't a problem getting rid of. Again, Jamie and her communication skills are on point. My bff got a sweet potato panna cotta.

As a table, we ordered the ricotta cheese with honey and bread and the apple salad. The salad was tasty, but it was mostly apples, with not many greens included. For an entree I had the arctic char, which was good but not great. As a dessert, the table split the apple fritter, which was delicious and the best thing we ate. The service was inattentive. No one in our group ordered any alcoholic drinks, and the server became visible distraught with that information. Their service significantly decreased as the evening went on, and they were much more interesting in serving the 8+ party nearby that was loud, boisterous, and undoubtedly spending a lot of money. But, we felt entirely marginalized by the service, which did not leave a good impression. I would be open to going to Gather again, as the food was good, although not great, and I'm willing to acknowledge that it might have been just one of those 'nights.'

Yes, even vegetarians can find happiness here! The dishes are accurately described. Chef Ken Carter is a genius artist, who produces incredibly well-presented and extremely creative plates with very interesting ingredients. Every dish is polished to perfection with a balance of flavors and textures served at the right temperature! Our favorites were the sunchock soup (mind blowing) heirloom beets and gnocchi but it was hard to single these out because every dish here is a work of art! WINE Excellent wine list with a wide spectrum of options and incredibly fair markups you would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else! For example, one of the most expensive bottles was a \u00a0y Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape at 79 dollars with a retail value of $40-$45!!! SERVICE Ryan was outstanding, just what you would want in your server! He knew food & wine in general, as well as the menu, from ingredients to how each dish was prepared. He was very accommodating (he gladly decantered our wine and agreed split our soup) and quick! Ryan was well-supported by other staff, all on top of their game the entire night!

While the place is very hip, the comfort of their guests has not been compromised for the sake of beauty, as it often happens in stylish River North spots where you are expected to sit on something that makes an electric chair sound good!

I don't really get wines but it was definitely an upgrade from barefoot. In terms of food, followed other Yelp recommendations and got the Gathering Board, Cured Salmon, and Whipped Ricotta. The Gathering Board was excellent, with a variety of cheeses, dips, and meats to share. If you have a short attention span, the Gathering Board is a solid choice. The Cured Salmon was probably my favorite. The flavors were subtle and rich - they mix an egg yolk in there to increase the silkiness. Finally, the Whipped Ricotta acted more as a dessert. As a ricotta hater, I was pleasantly surprised by it. It was my least favorite but still solid.---Circumstances play a big part in how good food tastes. I came to Gather relatively full and in a potentially awkward third wheel situation and left with the thought to give it five stars. The food is varied and THAT good. The service was excellent and the atmosphere reminded me of something European. You know this place is hip because all the food came on wooden plates.

Oh my God, the food.We ordered a number of sharing plates: whipped ricotta, crispy cauliflower, crispy brussels sprouts, garlic soup and the butternut squash gnocchi. I don't know what was better - there is no 'ranking' here; it was all memorable. Flavors tucked into tiny crevasses, butter and lemon through the brussels leaves, pillows of gnocchi with a delightful sauce, an amazing soup with crunchy garlic.

Buy it, boil it, and enjoy it...all of it! \u00a0They have things I don't even know what to do with but my mom was super impressed and shopped her heart \u00a0out. \u00a0They have jellies and jams and nut butters (OH and several types of butter downstairs by the cheeses, I couldn't tell you the difference but I'll jump on the butter brigade soon)...where was i? \u00a0Oh yeah, the jams and jellies and spreads...and puddings and teas. \u00a0Lots of teas! \u00a0And honey, so much honey!Now, I have yet to sit on their rooftop and enjoy a sammich and a beer but you bet your bottom dollar I'll be up there the first warmish day we have and they open said rooftop.Overall, Gene's is the sh&t. \u00a0Everyone who works there is resourceful and just a treat to talk to...stop in, look around, buy some stuff, and support local business!Yours truly,A loyal customer", "rating": "5"}, "1": {"date": [2016, 1, 22], "description": "European small specialty market shopping experience with greatest meat, German beer, pretzel, fresh pickle and jarred cabbage selection on the North side. \u00a0I wish all groceries were like this.They seem to have a bottleneck with their cash registers locking up or not accepting credit cards at interesting times like Christmas time and busy periods. \u00a0 This caused cash only and slowdowns at the registers at awkward times. \u00a0I trust they have that worked out and a better fallback plan then they had in place last year.", "rating": "4"}, "10": {"date": [2015, 9, 4], "description": "Love the store decor itself.

The concept is fantastic, and it's a great homage to the classic beer gardens in Germany and Austria. Considering the space is small, Gene's does a good job of maximizing space and creating an environment of good food, drink, and overall gemuetlichkeit. It's cash only! So be warned, they have an ATM near the counter but it's better to be prepared. Also it can get quite crowded so be forewarned. Also, depending on the time of day, it might be hard not to only find a seat, but also find a shaded seat. But with enough patience and wherewithal you should find something eventually. The food is standard German-Austrian beer garden cuisine. I've had most things on the menu, but last time I was there I had the Austrian cheese sausage, potato salad, and beets, all of which were ok to good. The best things on the menu, unexpectedly, are the potato pancakes. They look dense and uninviting, but they aren't! They are some tasty tasty potato pancakes -- don't sleep on potato pancakes. There's a small selection of non-alcoholic drinks, german/austrian beers on drafts and in cans. Gene's rooftop is a Lincoln Park summertime establishment. If you're a local then you should definitely already be aware of the greatness of Gene's. If you're a visitor of the city then adventure from the Loop by taking the Brown Line up to Western (it will take you 40 mins or so) and enjoy some authentic Chicago-neighbor fare with authentic German-Austrian grub.

Just figure out exactly what you want while you wait and the process will go quickly, and hey, then you'll walk away with fresh meat!

Their meat is preservative free so you'll either need to freeze it or use it within 1-2 days. Ask the staff anything!

I lean towards Old School, always friendly with no attitude.After more than a few visits at this location I've noticed a bit of attitude from some of the workers here, my gripe is primarily with the deli counter, the last visit really made me wonder if I should come back. The guy that waited on me lacked any customer service etiquette, did say hello, called my number and then just looked at me. As soon as I started to say what I wanted the guy next to him told me I can get what I wanted in the self serve case, well firstly the one package left it's contents looked sad, secondly I wanted other stuff that was in the deli case that I didn't have access to. When I told them that, I was able to proceed with my order. Unfortunately, the one other guy behind the case was waiting on another customer, he did see my frustration and gave me a friendly smile and engaged in some quick chit chat. My family has shopped at Gene's on Belmont for more years than I can remember, for my mom it was almost a weekly visit with either my sister or me in tow.

The restaurant was only about half-full at 9:30, but quickly filled up.Water, menus and silverware appear almost instantly. A waitress comes by within half a minute to offer coffee.The menu is large, and there was also a small Specials menu today. Do not think that this place is inexpensive! In fact, some of the prices are on the high side. It was $2.69 each for a Sprite and a Diet Coke, and coffee was $2.59. The Sprite drinker was especially shocked how expensive her soda cost. I ordered a Denver omelet without the ham. I got it with hash browns and a buttered English muffin (I was asked if I wanted it buttered). When it was delivered, it was clearly full of ham. I noticed it immediately; the waitress hardly had put it on the table. She apologized and took it back. She brought me hash browns on a separate plate, and then the correct omelet came a few minutes later. BTW, when we got the check, I saw that she had ordered it the way I wanted it. The kitchen got it wrong, and she was probably too busy to notice.It was a large omelet. I couldn't finish it, but I came close. I like pepper and onion in my omelet, which is why I chose this item, but the pepper and onion were raw. Most places will cook them first. I'm really not crazy about raw green pepper and onion in eggs; they're fine on a salad. So, I wasn't crazy about this. The Sprite woman ordered the Oreo Pancake, figuring ahead of time she'd take half of it home. When she ordered, the waitress asked if she wanted two or four pancakes. \"You mean I get a choice?\" Sprite woman asked. The woman said, she could even order only one if she liked. The restaurant had learned that customers didn't always want too much. Sprite woman was very happy with two, and she liked her entree very much. But, she was shocked when the check came. I know, I know, we all should have paid more attention to the cost when we ordered, but we were overwhelmed by the wide variety of choices.Diet Coke woman ordered the special; two eggs, two strips of bacon, two pancakes, for $6.99. She was not surprised when the bill came, but she did say she sure was paying a lot for soda.I was not shocked about the cost of my omelet, but I had already read some Yelp reviews and looked at the menu online. When you look at Golden Nugget, it looks very old-fashioned, Chicago diner-type. You may not expect the same kind of prices charged by Over Easy or other brunch places, but it is not cheap.I got numerous refills on my coffee, and the sodas were refilled often.Not perfect, not outstanding, but decent. I don't know if it would be my first choice if I were going out for breakfast again tomorrow, but I admit, the crepes did sound pretty good. It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It is what it is.

And I ordered a short stack as I was craving pancakes and I couldn't handle more than a few bites. Very thick and kind of gritty inside. This is a personal preference, but I hate thick pancakes.

In my old neighborhood the diner was able to fry potatoes in olive oil for me.I asked the server about this possibility and and he understood the question right away and checked with the kitchen. He was back quickly with the news that they could give me potatoes with olive oil. Yay! He brought me a serving of delicious fried potatoes that was so generous I had to take some of them home.

The restaurant was only about half-full at 9:30, but quickly filled up.Water, menus and silverware appear almost instantly. A waitress comes by within half a minute to offer coffee.The menu is large, and there was also a small Specials menu today. Do not think that this place is inexpensive! In fact, some of the prices are on the high side. It was $2.69 each for a Sprite and a Diet Coke, and coffee was $2.59. The Sprite drinker was especially shocked how expensive her soda cost. I ordered a Denver omelet without the ham. I got it with hash browns and a buttered English muffin (I was asked if I wanted it buttered). When it was delivered, it was clearly full of ham. I noticed it immediately; the waitress hardly had put it on the table. She apologized and took it back. She brought me hash browns on a separate plate, and then the correct omelet came a few minutes later. BTW, when we got the check, I saw that she had ordered it the way I wanted it. The kitchen got it wrong, and she was probably too busy to notice.It was a large omelet. I couldn't finish it, but I came close. I like pepper and onion in my omelet, which is why I chose this item, but the pepper and onion were raw. Most places will cook them first. I'm really not crazy about raw green pepper and onion in eggs; they're fine on a salad. So, I wasn't crazy about this. The Sprite woman ordered the Oreo Pancake, figuring ahead of time she'd take half of it home. When she ordered, the waitress asked if she wanted two or four pancakes. \"You mean I get a choice?\" Sprite woman asked. The woman said, she could even order only one if she liked. The restaurant had learned that customers didn't always want too much. Sprite woman was very happy with two, and she liked her entree very much. But, she was shocked when the check came. I know, I know, we all should have paid more attention to the cost when we ordered, but we were overwhelmed by the wide variety of choices.Diet Coke woman ordered the special; two eggs, two strips of bacon, two pancakes, for $6.99. She was not surprised when the bill came, but she did say she sure was paying a lot for soda.I was not shocked about the cost of my omelet, but I had already read some Yelp reviews and looked at the menu online. When you look at Golden Nugget, it looks very old-fashioned, Chicago diner-type. You may not expect the same kind of prices charged by Over Easy or other brunch places, but it is not cheap.I got numerous refills on my coffee, and the sodas were refilled often.Not perfect, not outstanding, but decent. I don't know if it would be my first choice if I were going out for breakfast again tomorrow, but I admit, the crepes did sound pretty good. It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It is what it is.

Unfortunately, living in an area with overpriced and less than great produce forces me to travel all over the city multiple times a month to a produce store. I read about Harvest Time on Yelp and never went and yesterday I decided it was time to check it out. If you're like me and you have shopped at Stanley's and kind of wanted a comparison I'll provide one for you. Harvest has a nice wide produce section-there's not people ramming into the back of your legs or staring at you like \"MOVE OUT OF MY WAY\" when you're picking your produce. I did not see an organic section at Harvest. Harvest isn't AS cheap as Stanley's, BUT they are still cheap and the produce is better quality.For example, at Stanley's butternut squash is often 19-30 cents a lb, but it's all moldy or just plain scary looking. Yesterday, I came here and the butternut squash I believe was either 69 or 89 cents, but they all looked perfect. This has more affordable and good sales on things like meat ($4.99/grass fed beef (again most stores charge $5.99-$6.99/lb) and $14/lb gruyere cheese (most stores charge $17-$22/lb). They have a lot of really awesome European things such as Greek pasta ($1 for a bag), different vinegars, different olive oils, different imported chocolate and cookies. Some of the good deals I found:PURPLE POTATOES (haven't seen these in Chicago until I came here) $1.49/lbAcorn Squash .39/lbvarious apples in prime condition .89-.98/lbBlack Kale $1.49/lbRed Kale $1.49/lbBeets .49/lbOverall, the service is nice. It's clean, it's quiet, and no one is glaring at you because of the mad frenzy over cheap produce.

Nearly 2 years later, I finally came here. Parking wasn't difficult, as they have both street and private lot parking.The wait was longer than usual (30 mins for us) at ~2pm on Easter Sunday. Since there aren't many seats, I'd make reservations to avoid waiting. Despite this, our waiter was conscientious and made sure to take our order while we were in line. That way, our food arrival would coincide with our table availability.I don't have a point of reference for Filipino decor, but it is very simple here. They have bamboo decorations at their entrance and in some of their wall art. They have bilingual signs, so I learned how to say \"welcome\" and \"thank you\" while waiting. Quick lesson in Tagalog for sure.The eggplant tomato tower was delicious; notably, the homemade dressing of mustard, garlic, chive and cheese married all the flavors perfectly! I was in an eggplant mood, so I also got the tortang talong. Again, the sauce (i.e. banana ketchup) really made the dish. I finished off with a halo-halo, which allowed me to try the purple yam ice cream for the first time (yummy!) and vaguely reminded me of Taiwanese shaved ice. The only thing that threw me off was the green-striped wafer stick, but that was a welcome addition to the ice cold dessert.Overall, I'd definitely come back if I ever have cravings for Filipino food in the Chicago area!", "rating": "5"}, "11": {"date": [2015, 9, 5], "description": "There is no other place that I have been taking my non-Filipino friends or recommend to non-Filipino who want to taste authentic and good Filipino dishes here in the Chicago area...

We ended our lovely lunch with the halo halo dessert which wasn't my favorite. I loved the ube ice cream that topped it off but I wasn't too much of a fan of the shaved ice + stuff at the bottom. In general, I never really like this type of dessert even in similar forms from other countries. The small bites of flan on top was super thick but otherwise had really good flavor.

I would say the places in California are better but I think it's because there's more of a concentration of Filipinos on the west coast. The Lechon Kawali was the best - big pieces of pork and sweet sauce. The pancit palabok was ok - too many onions and not enough noodles, but still ok. Loved the lumpia, but a little on the smaller side; however, amazing sauce! It wasn't the regular sweet and tangy taste - there was a little bit of spice in it, which I liked.

A nice old man at the table behind us saw the dish and came over to ask what it was because it looked so good.We shared a Halo-Halo for dessert and it was pretty good. The purple ice cream (whatever it is) is tasty and so is the shaved ice. The red bean stuff at the bottom was... interesting. Either way, a good little dessert to split!One fun note - the music here was crazy on our visit. It was all modern music but it was a really weird variety. We had some classic romantic tunes that we joked were going to lead to a candle lit dinner, shortly followed by 90s rap hits, classic rock, and even some more 'metal' tunes.

It sounded so good. . . but man, it was like eating a lard sandwich. I mean, I know that salami is fatty, but seriously, this sandwich was practically squishing when I bit into it. Add the bag of chips I wolfed down, and I'm looking at approximately 1250 calories, just for lunch. Good thing I skipped breakfast!Here's what I do like about JJ:- the chips are yummy- the delivery guy is very nice- the Unwich- any sandwich on lettuce instead of bread. Since I hate the bread I usually go for this option. It makes for a much lighter sandwich, kind of a cross between a salad and a burrito.

In the straight-up Serb and Croatian tradition, they make it with pork. Because Bosnians are muslim, they make it with veal. Either way, it's amazing. It's a stew with small medalions of meat in a tomato-pepper sauce that is somewhat spicy, a bit peppery, and with feta cheese on the side. That description may fail to grab you, because it's kinda hard to put into words, but it is an amazing dish, tasty as hell. For some stretches, I've gone to Kiko's once a week and never get tired of it. It's rare to find it on the menu anywhere in Chicago, and from my experiences, only Kiko's does it well, in a rich sauce.They also serve a very, very decent schnitzel made with actual veal, huge in size and tasty as good as anything in Europe.The history of the Austrio-Hungarian Empire had its effect on the food of the people who lived in what was later called Yugoslavia, and later the broken up elements of it. \u00a0I've also had the goulash, and \u00a0it's as good a goulash as it gets. It was accompanied by great mashed potatoes.In the salad department, they have a shopska salad - very large - consisting of finely chopped cucumber and red bell pepper, covered with feta cheese and an olive, It, too, is kinda addictive. Vinegar and oil are on the side at every table so you can eat it according to your own taste.A generous portion of bread - I'm guessing it's a bread characteristic of the Balkans - and butter is served with the salad. It is a memorable and tasty bread and I have to hold myself back so I don't get full on bread before the main dish arrives!They have a full line of Balkan sausages, crepes, tripes and liver dishes, etc., which are not my cup of tea. But I see the other patrons, from that part of the world, putting them away with gusto.This restaurant is really an authentic experience in Bosnian culture, Kiko's mainly serves a Bosnian, ethnic clientele, and it's possible to feel a bit like an outsider until they know you. Most of the people you will see here are Bosnian family groups, sometimes three generations, and younger Bosnian couples, close to the immigration experience. Kiko's is a bit ethnically clanish and other posters here have commented about that. I can only tell you that they will warm up a bit once they recognize you, or maybe you won't notice any distance at all. This is about as close to being in Europe as you can experience in Chicago.

The waitress said that there was nothing she could do and that the manger wanted us to pay for it. Rather than coming out and speaking to us himself the manager had the waitress relay his message to us, and inform us that they would not cover the charge for the horribly cooked meat. The owner chose to lose 7 loyal customers over an 80 dollar tab. Not only was the food awful the service and treatment we received from the owner was unbelievable.

We passed a few restaurants along Lincoln but nothing made us look twice. Until the wonderful smell of steak wafted out the door of La Cabana de Don Luis. When you walk in, you think you're walking into a cafeteria. Not much going on as far as atmosphere. The soccer game is on the overhead TV. Maybe 8 or 10 tables total. But, it smells and looks clean. That's what matters to me rather than the decorations and such. Its a family run business and we're here to try them out and support our neighbors. I can't believe they've been here for a year and a half and we never knew. Glad to have finally found them. Oh yea, lets go in here. It smells good. We sat down, ordered a couple of soft drinks, steak burritos, beef tacos, quesadillas. The waitress brought us some chips and salsa (green and orange). Hubby dug into the orange, nearly cried! lol! I loved it. It was a good heat. I think I used the rest of it on my burrito. Burritos were very nice. Not too much beans, lots of steak, good seasoning. The tacos were decent (I'm not a fan of beef, I prefer steak but my sister doesn't so... she ate them and was the one who was saying she wasn't even hungry) The quesadilla was pretty good too. Fresh sour cream, tomato and lettuce competed the dish. I don't know, I really liked the food. I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to Mexican food. I enjoyed it and so did my husband and sister. In fact, he wants to go back today! It's actually very economical. $5.50 for a nice size steak burrito is a bargain. I couldn't even finish it!

I will admit it was a bit overwhelming. Breakfast options include: Mexican egg dishes, omelettes, waffles, crepes, yogurt, pancakes, french toast with a ton of topping options as well as my favorite: a ton of different types of chilaquiles! Brunch/lunch options include: sandwiches, tortas, sopes, and entrees among a ton of other offerings. What is probably the best thing on the menu though are the beverage options - SO many! The area doesn't really have a good juice option so this fills the void: tons of freshly squeezed juices, smoothies, various types of hot chocolate, and coffee. My husband and I stopped here for brunch this weekend & I ordered the \"Exotico\", a freshly squeezed orange, strawberry & pineapple juice & my husband ordered the caf\u00e9 de olla - a Mexican coffee with cinnamon. Both were excellent! Eats: I absolutely loved my chipotle chilaquiles - spicy, authentic and a huge portion!

Thankfully, it seems that the service issues are mostly resolved, as the last three or four times I have gone have been great, with flawless service.The menu is huge, and seems to cater to both the Hispanic AND gringo clientele. Their chilaquiles and cafe de la olla are amazing, but they also have some great paninis, waffles, and even crepes. You really can't go wrong at this place, but in my opinion the chilaquiles a la diabla are the best (if you can handle the spice!), and even better if you add some chicken on top.I was pretty sad when Los Nopales left, but now that La Catedral is open I actually think we're better off.

Having a Vietnamese sister in law along with many many business trips to Houston and California, I must say I am very familiar with Vietnamese Cuisine. I love absolutely love love love LC, let's start with the LC's staff, they certainly epitomize service, oh so very welcoming and polite. The waiter and waitress always make sure I have what I need and I definitely never go thirsty when they're running the floor. One particular time I came in for lunch when it was not busy and you know how it is when you eat lunch alone, you tend to hide away on your phone avoiding any awkward eye contact but seriously one of the manager sat at the table next to mine and we literally just bonded over a show of Maury. Bottom line, they care, a lot, which makes the meal and tipping even more enjoyable. As much love and care they put into the service they put two folds in their pho, my advice don't eat your pho right away, put your head over your bowl and take a good wiff! I don't know what it is but you can smell all the herbs and seasoning, it's like a blast of flavors without even tasting the broth AND THEN you can eat your hot pho, with caution of course. The broth is savory and bountiful of meat and noodles. I asked for steamed bean sprouts and of course they accommodate to my every need, i ask for extra and i got that too.

We exchanged the standards 'how goes it' and then I proceed to be dumbfounded as to what liquor I wanted. Here is where things went bad....A young woman probably in her mid 30s walks in and picks up a six pack of what looked like Corona and went to the counter, the man behind the counter immediately tells her that she has to buy something more than 10 dollars to use a card and she politely responds with something to the effect of \"my apologies, the sticker reads 9.99 and I figured it would be okay\" and this guy f'ng lost his mind. He begins yelling and screaming at the lady and waving his arms all over the place in a very threatening manner. By this point I have decided to just watch and let her defend herself, but she decides that she will just get two six packs. She walks over to the cooler to get another and he intercepts her, yanks the 6 pack out of her hand and tells her she isn't buying from his store. At this point she begins to lose her f'ng mind and is going wild. I figure its best to get the woman out of the store so I politely usher her out of the store while being sure to tell this man he is a dick. Point is, I can respect your fees and taxes, banks are screwing us all, and when I walked in, I was playing with my cell phone (which he has signs posted saying its a no no) and he didn't say a word to me. I took the lady to the store on the other corner and we bought our libation and we both lived on. I beg you to not shop there.

I've gotten prime NY Strip steaks here several times and contend that, based on my experiences, it's some of the best steak available for retail in Chicago. In fact, over the summer I had a NY Strip from LQMM, followed the next weekend by one from Gene's and LQMM was much superior (not to diss Gene's though -- they have great sausages and deli and are a cool store for euro food products in general). We also order our TDay Turkey here every year. Grass-fed Amish-raised turkey, and again, always fresh and never frozen. I read some of the Yelp complaints about surly staff, but that has never been my experience. Somedays they're really busy and you have to wait, but if you go in the afternoon on a weekday, it's very calm. LQMM also sells homemade brats and other encased meats, which I've never had, and has a large selection of buffalo meat.

And if you've patiently waited in line for Cevapcici Chicago's Balkan slow food at the festivals, then you've also tasted LQMM's meaty goodness. Yes, it's true: this is Phil's go-to meat source!Besides other Eastern European specialties such as raznjici (pork kebabs), they carry ever-popular items such as a comprehensive collection of steak cuts, Italian sausage, German sausage, smoked sausage, housemade bacon, free range poultry, as well as pork chops/ribs/tenderloin and more.They also carry cheese and will whip you up a made-to-order sandwich! But the best thing about LQMM (besides the beautiful, plump cevapcici) is that they carry the quintessential cevapcici accompaniment, kajmak.

Lawrence on Sunday nights. \u00a0I live in Forest Park so I take the Eisenhower to Lakeshore Drive to Lawrence then going home, I get right back on Lakeshore Drive to the Eisenhower.On this particular night, I really craved pizza. \u00a0Not just any pizza, but a very specific type of pizza from a very specific place: \u00a0I wanted Little Caesar's stuffed crust. \u00a0We were debating betwixt several different spots but the stuffed crust is what solidified LC's as the place to go. \u00a0After some phone research, I discovered there was one a bit further west down Lawrence. \u00a0It would make our drive back home longer, but it'd be worth it because I'd have my stuffed crust. \u00a0Well.Since stuffed crust is not a hot and ready, I had my husband call ahead to order a large cheese stuffed crust pizza. \u00a0I was sitting right next to him in the car when he called. \u00a0He's a little flaky and normally I'd blame him for the mix-up that would ensue but I really did witness that phone call. \u00a0So we pull up into the parking lot about 15 minutes later and husband goes in to pick up our pizza. \u00a0He is in there for a suspiciously long time. \u00a0I finally get out of the car and go in to see what he's up to. \u00a0Finally his name is called. \u00a0I felt just a tad uneasy about the goings on so I hissed at husband to make sure it was a stuffed crust pizza. \u00a0Surprise! \u00a0It wasn't. \u00a0So husband says to the guy \"It was supposed to be stuffed crust.\" \u00a0The fellow says \"Oh, we don't have stuffed crust at this location.\" \u00a0WHAT????? \u00a0A very awkward silence followed. \u00a0I'm sorry, the entire effing point of calling ahead was not to order a freaking hot and ready cheese pizza. \u00a0Why didn't they tell us on the phone when we ordered a stuffed crust pizza that they don't have stuffed crust?!?!! \u00a0We drove past a Pizza Hut on the way there! \u00a0I would've gone to Pizza Hut instead! \u00a0Their pizza sucks but at least I would've had what I wanted. \u00a0Honestly, I tear the crust off and eat that, leaving the rest of the pizza for husband. \u00a0Anyway, back to the scene. \u00a0So husband, who is also somewhat bewildered by what is happening says that we called ahead and ordered one so the employee says \"Oh.\" \u00a0And then adds very robotically, \"Sorry for the inconvenience.\" \u00a0Inconvenience???? \u00a0It's not so much of an inconvenience as it is you let us order something that you don't even have! \u00a0An inconvenience would be having to wait a long time but at least we'd still have what we wanted. \u00a0In this case, we had to settle for a different product altogether! \u00a0We ended up taking the stupid cheese pizza anyway, because we were so hungry and just wanted to get home but man, I try to eat somewhat healthy and don't allow myself to indulge in pizza that often if I can help it. \u00a0When I do, it's a treat. \u00a0So there's nothing more of a bummer than to get your hopes up to treat yourself to one of your greatest indulgences and then not get it and have to settle for something else.The whole thing is kind of funny and I'm being pretty tongue in cheek about this but the thing that most irks me is that they LET US ORDER SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE! \u00a0If they just would've told us that when we called there would be no problem. \u00a0Don't take an order that you can't fulfill! \u00a0 That's what pissed me off more than anything. \u00a0That guy really couldn't have given two sh!ts about what happened. \u00a0It gets even better. \u00a0I took my crust catastrophe to their corporate office and have yet to hear back from them. \u00a0I'm being generous with my two star review, btw.", "rating": "2"}, "8": {"date": [2014, 10, 21], "description": "Very pleasant experience at Little Caesars. \u00a0I slipped the ma\u00eetre d a $20 and said your best table my good man. \u00a0Then he led me to a private table in the kitchen...they have nothing to hide there. \u00a0I think that table is normally reserved for celebrities.", "rating": "5"}, "9": {"date": [2010, 10, 12], "description": "Am I seriously writing a review for Little Caesars?

At the seafood counter, they were out of fresh swordfish, but the young lady said the new order was due in any moment. I said I'm heading to the coffee bar for a while. Sure enough, 10 minutes later the young lady came DOWNSTAIRS to the coffee bar to tell me order was in, come get some fresh swordfish.

We grabbed wine from the wine bar on the 2nd floor and then made a plate from the hot entree station, which we ate in the cafe section overlooking the store (great people watching!). Still hungry, we ponied up to the Oyster bar -- they were running an August 12-for-$12 special. Nick and Jim at the oyster bar were very friendly and the oysters were great for such a deal.

I was delighted to see the store come to our neighborhood because prior to that we had to shop at a rundown Dominick's that was going downhill very fast. I since moved from Lakeshore east and was happy to see that they were opening a new store near me once again in Ravenswood. My first impression was that the store was just as nice if not a little better than the lakeshore East store however after few less pleasureable visits to their meat department I have to say that I am very disappointed. First off it seems like none of the personnel behind the meat counter know anything about the meat they sell. I can go into details why I say this but it'll be too lengthy. Not to mention the poor customer service but the poor selection in the meat case outside in the store. \u00a0It seems like everytime I go there they don't have any selection on the steaks leaving me hopeless to the meat counter and the staff. I am not asking for much I just would like a nice selection of steaks at least two or three to choose from. It seems like they are always sold out, if they're not sold out the steaks that are there are either the super thin cut or 32inches thick !! Who would eat that much meat in one sitting to begin with other than a big guy like Shaquille O'Neal. I can't eat over a pound of meat it'll make me sick. I go to other grocery stores and find steaks that are suitable around a inch and a quarter thick and less than a pound priced around 9-10 dollars.Another thing is why do they have a number machine when they never use it leaving the customers responsible for deciding who's next causing confusion and conflict? Why are there so many employees just standing around? look at them, its a waste of money! I would rather have less people standing around and more helpful knowledgeable trained people to assist me when I need help!! Upon going to the meat department last night it was 8:45 and they already had everything closed down I stood there and was looking inside the counter, four meat department personnel just stood there and then walked away no one asked me if I needed help. It says they are open until 9. I guess there was a big party going on somewhere that they had to attend to. So I ended up leaving the store and having to go 20 minutes away it took me an hour out of my time in tottal for what would have taken me only 5 minutes had the meat department staff actually helped me and got me the one steak that I was just looking to buy, isn't that sad when you just want to spend your money but since it is not the meat counter person that makes the profit in that department I guess he can care less. Not to mention while you shop just listen to the innercom every 3 seconds like an annoying car alarm in the city you hear customer asistance to register one customer assistance to register 2. I soon found out it's because none of the cashiers are old enough to sell alcohol so what happens is that people end up standing waiting in line for someone to walk over there and scan their liquor. It just seems to me to be another case of a company that has expanded too fast, they open up with a great concept with good customer service while all the head honchos are around but once it settles into place and the heads of state leave it goes down the drain little by little. When Mariano's profit margin shrinks maybe they'll realize that they need the train their employees better and keep the eye on the prize which is the customer!", "rating": "3"}, "42": {"date": [2015, 5, 22], "description": "I love this store and the staff.

I am not a lowlife person that will mess with people's businesses but this lady needs a good warning from the management. I am pretty sure she is a great lady. But her actual job is taking care, cleaning up the food area. Not to socialize or entertain people there. -Couple weeks ago, in my visit, she was talking about the train, how fast it goes, how it has stop in front of their view bla bla bla... with 3 young guys sitting there. And we all were listening. And lots of loud laughs. - In my next visit, she was all about God and Jesus with a hispanic lady, who probably has nothing better to do since she was sitting there for a good hour, not eating. - And today, she was having a word (or a thousand) with a lady sitting by the counter. She seemed a little annoyed, that's why it was not as long as other two. Then she turned to us and asking how our day was. We successfully dodged the conversation. I swear i am not being mean. I don't want her to lose her job. But come on. People go there for quiet atmosphere (at least i do), i believe that is the reason they have nice live music playing. And it is not a cafe or a place that you want to socialize while eating your food in your lunch break or so. If management is reading this, PLEASE don't take any harsh action against her.

Go with a group. More friends = variety!2. Ask for the special menu if they don't give it to you. This menu offers congee (similar to porridge). Congee is comfort food to many Asian households. It is rice, but more of the wet soupy side.3. If you order 5 dishes, you get a large congee for free!Although the decor is a bit odd, the food is on point. I love the vibrant color each dish brings to the table. During our late night outing, of the numerous dishes we ordered, I would recommend:- Mushroom Trio - (Vegetarian) if you are a mushroom lover like me than you don't have to think twice. Light and goes well with the congee.- Bean Sprout w/ Fish Tofu - This flavorful dish packs a punch but nothing to sweat about. One of my favorite dish of the night!- Crispy Pork Belly Stir Fry - I am big on texture, so this dish nailed it for me. A little on the fatty side, but pure goodness. Crispy and crunch pork belly stir fry with bell peppers, jalapenos, and onions to give it color. Drizzle the saucy over your congee and pig out.Overall, unique concept that I have not seen in Chicago before that offers comfort Thai food.

Well if you happen to be around Ravenswood area, give this spot a try. Slightly hidden and can easily be overlooked, this little hidden gem offers a variety of dishes. What you may need to know:1. Go with a group. More friends = variety!2. Ask for the special menu if they don't give it to you. This menu offers congee (similar to porridge). Congee is comfort food to many Asian households. It is rice, but more of the wet soupy side.3. If you order 5 dishes, you get a large congee for free!Although the decor is a bit odd, the food is on point. I love the vibrant color each dish brings to the table. During our late night outing, of the numerous dishes we ordered, I would recommend:- Mushroom Trio - (Vegetarian) if you are a mushroom lover like me than you don't have to think twice. Light and goes well with the congee.- Bean Sprout w/ Fish Tofu - This flavorful dish packs a punch but nothing to sweat about. One of my favorite dish of the night!- Crispy Pork Belly Stir Fry - I am big on texture, so this dish nailed it for me. A little on the fatty side, but pure goodness. Crispy and crunch pork belly stir fry with bell peppers, jalapenos, and onions to give it color. Drizzle the saucy over your congee and pig out.Overall, unique concept that I have not seen in Chicago before that offers comfort Thai food.

What kind of Colombiano Connection did you think I meant?!?! Arepas and empanadas are a meal unto themselves. Arepas are made with ground corn which explains why the dough is yellow. As we walked in here I noticed the evocative redolent of their fresh baked goodies and the strong aroma of caf\u00e9 Colombiano. Arepas con queso (with cheese) are best sampled warm. Of course, this was the first thing I ordered along with a fish bowl sized cup of caf\u00e9 Colombiano con leche (with milk). I also tried a coconut bread, which was not overly sweet. It was light and fluffy. I tried a guava with cheese bread. It was like a cross between a light fluffy bagel and a dense donut, but it was not overly sweet. The amalgamation of the sweet guava and salty cheese was my fave! Yeah, yeah, I got my fix of carbs here. They also have empanadas con carne (either chicken or beef), so I ordered a half-dozen to take home. I warmed them up for lunch at 325 degrees for five minutes. Wow, these were exceptional and loaded with lots of sabor. I was depleted after an early morning Spin Class on Saturday. I took out my I-Phone, and searched and got a hit on Mekato's Colombian Bakery. I was super fain that they were open for business. BTW, this place is fairly small, but they have a long mustard yellow and hunter green tile counter with about eight bar stools. There are two small tables shoved up against the front large glass windows. You can sit here and enjoy your coffee and Colombian goodies. If you do not enjoy being elbow-to-elbow with strangers you may not want to stay here. Colombia is famous for its coffee (Juan Valdez and Oma), and whether you have ever had it (or not) be sure to sample the Colombian coffee here. El caf\u00e9 Colombiano es suave con acidez y cuerpo medio o alto y aroma pronunciado y completo. (Translation: \"The coffee is smooth in acidity with a medium or strong body and a pronounced and complete aroma.\") No, this is not the kind of coffee that will grow hair on your chest, but if you want to have energy for 12 hours or even good sex, drink several cups. Trust me! Tintos (pronounced \"Tin-tows\") are very small cups of coffee (similar to an Italian Espresso). Once you have tried Colombian coffee you'll be hooked. It's robust, strong and very addictive. My friend, who took the Spin class with me, tried something insanely different. Something that I never thought could be possible. WHAT DAT? WHAT DAT? If you have never tried authentic Colombian hot chocolate, well, you haven't really experienced life! \u00a0It may sound a bit strange to pair hot chocolate with a soft white cheese. You may even think \"no way\" but trust me, give it a shot. This typical Colombian food combination is surprisingly delectable as it is unexpected. My friend purchased the soft white cheese down the street (east side of street there is a brand-name grocery store). The traditional Colombian hot chocolate is made without added sugar or milk (as it should be). Drop in cubes of white cheese and let them sit in your hot chocolate for one or two minutes. Let them soak up the hot chocolate, fish them out with a spoon, and devour those little suckers. Once I tasted this, I had to order one for myself. Padre celestial que incre\u00edble y extraordinario -- you are very welcome for that tip! ;DThis place was not overly busy when we arrived. I guess most people were sleeping off their Friday night hangovers as it was not crowded. It was nice to be in a quiet environment and talk for a bit. The service was friendly and effusive. I appreciated the young lady's philoxenia. You have to be aggressive here, otherwise, you may get ignored. Get in their face. Literally. Don't be afraid to speak up and place your order. They do have a number system (take a number) but they never call any numbers. Makato's is on the east side of the street and across the street from the Chicago Police Department. There is a $5 minimum purchase for debit/credit card. Parking was easy and it is \"Pay to Park.\" When the lady told me my total for everything I asked her to repeat it -- I thought there must be some mistake. Wow, it was incredibly inexpensive! The next time I am craving Arepas con queso or delicious meat empanadas (they are small though) and \u00a0authentic, robust caf\u00e9 Colombiano, I will definitely make a special trip back to my Colombiano conexi\u00f3n -- Mekato's!", "rating": "5"}, "11": {"date": [2015, 8, 31], "description": "This is an amazing place to come visit.

I've experienced better.Have you ever seen a squirrel struggle to crack open a nut and wonder if it's really worth the effort? Effort vs. RewardSome foods are high effort, low yield: for instance, lobster. It's messy, kind of hard to get at the meat, and after you're done, there's not all that much meat to be had, other than in the claws and tail. If you've ever disassembled a lobster head trying to scavenge meat, you know what I'm talking about. Crab is even higher effort with less reward. But provided that you like crab meat or lobster, it's generally perceived as worth the effort. Maybe not for every meal, but once in a while. Mekato's has a machine that spits out numbered tickets, much like any other bakery you've been to. Typically, the numbers are issued in sequence, and the employees behind the counter work through the numbers from low to high.Not so much the case at Mekato's. You may find that having stood around for five minutes with a lower number doesn't mean that you will get your items before some regular who breezes in, ignores the tickets, and just starts ordering with the same employee who was supposed to be helping you. You may find that speaking english will put you in the very back of the priority list, and you may find yourself being ignored. You may find that speaking spanish won't do much good either if the employees decide that rather than taking your order, they would rather run into the cooking area in the back and hide out for a few minutes, or write up receipts for people at the counter who've not asked for any service. You may find any number of reasons that causes what should be a 2 to 3 minute transaction - order, pay, receive goods, to turn into a 10 - 15 minute ordeal. You may wonder what the point of having a machine that dispenses numbered tickets is, if the employees routinely ignore the numbers and just serve the guests that are regulars, or get their attention first. And this is where my original question comes back into play... I found myself wondering exactly how much of a hassle is it worth going through to eat the food from Mekato's.Yes, the empanadas are good. Yes, the arepas are good.Yes, the bunuelos are good.Yes, the guava paste and cajeta are good. In fact, they are very good. The guava filling is unique and definitely noteworthy. In fact, the quality of the baked goods is very high across the board. Probably not the best you've ever had, but absolutely not anywhere near the worst.The flaky pastries - like orejas - are not that good, but overall, this is a very good bakery, and 80% of what they make, they make well. However, most bakeries are pretty simple operations. Getting in and out is usually pretty easy - by design.Mekato's is kind of a disaster when it comes to getting your food and in an expedient and efficient manner. Completely horrendous service. Thoughtless, amateurish, disorderly, you name it, it applies here. Is this place worth the hassle? \u00a0They legitimately deserve a 0-star rating for service and a 4-star rating for the food.If this sounds like something you would want to give a shot, then by all means, have at it.

Maybe it was just some sort of communication error on my part or something.That having been said, the beverage they gave us was very tasty, so....hooray!I also tried a chicken empanada, and that was excellent as well. The temperature was perfect and I couldn't find anything to complain about there. I would definitely go back for more. They have a decent selection of other hot foods as well.As for baked goods, we ordered two large sugar cookies and a cinnamon stick. They were all good, not great. I would be eager to try some of the other baked goods from there though - I saw some chocolate cake....mmmmmmm.......If you go and plan on eating in, beware, there are a very small amount of seating.

Elephant ears, rice pudding, cookies, neat looking thingies that just cannot be described. \u00a0Basically, a lot of variety. \u00a0Also, they serve a limited amount of \"hot food\" from a heated lamp area. \u00a0So I tried out some cafe con leche (basically a cafe latte - aka milk with coffee for our english only speakers) which was very good. \u00a0Also a side of rice-pudding and an elephant ear. \u00a0The rice pudding was extremely dry, so it was not the most fresh...

So why only 2-stars since I've been saying all good stuff?! \u00a0 Let me explain. \u00a0First, it was not a very warm environment concerning the staff. \u00a0When I asked if they had a menu (since there is no info on the walls), I was replied with, \"No, we don't. \u00a0You should have seen the prices on the cabinet.\" \u00a0There was some attitude in that sentence.

If I were in the neighborhood, sure. Maybe. How did we get here? Let's back up...After hearing so many good things, I made the trek up Lincoln, found parking (never really an issue over here) and stepped inside. It's not so much a restaurant as it is a... bakery. Which, dud, makes sense because 'bakery' is in the name. So, for your expectation's sake, don't come here expecting service. Come here expecting display cases filled with lots of choices and a few tables by the window at which to eat. A good number of people there the day I went got their orders to go -- which was a good call. I'll get there.I took a tour around the perimeter, made some choices and ordered: chicken pie with green sauce, arepa w/cheese and a lulo juice. Let's start with the best: lulo juice! You know how I am about new fruit and juices. Combine the two and I am in hog heaven. The juice had a delicate flavor that reminded me of a non-sugary limeade without pulp (like a berry or melon juice). It was refreshing and I was entirely geeked to be trying something different. Thumbs up for lulo! The chicken pie (empanada) was decent. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it tasted good enough and the green sauce added some depth and heat that complimented the meat and shell. Cool. The arepa, however, was a disaster. When I ordered one with cheese, I had in my mind the arepas I've had in Puerto Rico and in Puerto Rican restaurants: stuffed. i expected the arepa to be stuffed with melted, gooey cheese. This arepa came topped with a slice of white cheese that wasn't quite hot. The consistency was gummy and the taste was... unpleasant. I tried putting sauce on it. Nothing. I tried combining the bite with the empanda. Mistake. The arepa single-handedly took the bloom of the rose. Once I was in the arepa's web, I began to notice all sorts of things that bothered me: the seating was too close together, the eating space was entirely too cramped, the tables were too small... etc.If I were to ever come here again, I'd stock up on new (to me) juices, nab a couple of empanadas (with ample green sauce) and get it to go.

This mellow green tea was greatly appreciated as I was in need for a little needed a warm up. I looked over the menu and ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien.When the giant, hot and steamy bowl of soup arrived I could not believe the presentation (see my photo below) and the size. Leftovers anyone? The Pho Tai Bo Vien consists of sliced beef, tender meat balls, rice noodles, onions all in a savory broth. On the side was a garnish plate with basil, Thai basil, bean sprouts and jalape\u00f1o slices and you can add a little or a lot of it to your liking. Each spoonful got better as I shoveled my way through this delicious soup. With all the sucking and slurping noises coming from my table you would have though I was being impolite, but everyone else was slurping along with me. It took me over an hour to finish my meal and I was only halfway through my bowl. \"A to-go container for the rest of the Pho,\" my server asked. \"Yes, please!\" I replied. Now I knew I had Pho for later.My New Asia experience was great. Everything I ever need in a hot bowl of Pho was met. If you have a hankering for Pho, give New Asia a shot.

I looked over the menu and ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien.When the giant, hot and steamy bowl of soup arrived I could not believe the presentation (see my photo below) and the size. Leftovers anyone? The Pho Tai Bo Vien consists of sliced beef, tender meat balls, rice noodles, onions all in a savory broth. On the side was a garnish plate with basil, Thai basil, bean sprouts and jalape\u00f1o slices and you can add a little or a lot of it to your liking. Each spoonful got better as I shoveled my way through this delicious soup. With all the sucking and slurping noises coming from my table you would have though I was being impolite, but everyone else was slurping along with me. It took me over an hour to finish my meal and I was only halfway through my bowl. \"A to-go container for the rest of the Pho,\" my server asked. \"Yes, please!\" I replied. Now I knew I had Pho for later.My New Asia experience was great. Everything I ever need in a hot bowl of Pho was met. If you have a hankering for Pho, give New Asia a shot.

The banh mi had a flavorful homemade p\u00e2t\u00e9, viet mayo and good amount of soy sauce. Their picked daikon and carrots were on point as well. The bread is incredibly fresh and had good texture as a good banh mi should have. They had I believe up to 18 or 19 selections. There's other things offered too, which included fresh fruit smoothies to homemade desserts and savory snacks. Let's not forget the push for sriracha sauce at the front counter.

It seemed like we had just put in our order when we saw the two most beautiful stacks of brioche French toast we had ever seen heading our way!! We were in absolute heaven! The candy apple French toast was served with fresh Granny Smith Apple bits and cinnamon pastry cream between the toast... Holy cow. The blueberry peach cobbler French toast had a vanilla bean glaze and it was topped with house made granola. We couldn't decide which was our favorite! The second time we went was on a Sunday afternoon around 1, and there was about a 30 minute wait. The wait didn't seem very long, and it moved quickly because of their 8 minute standard- which held true even on a busy Sunday.

I ordered the Sassy Eggs- one of their specials. 2 over easy eggs on a bed of chorizo and potato hash, topped with ketchup and sour cream. Oh. My. Gosh. It was amazing.

Yet, people will actually drive to this place, take on the challenge of parking during lunch time and have it to go. Whatever you order from this place you will be generally pleased, more so if you have low standards or are extremely hungry. You will definitely get it cheaper here than the other guys or view it as getting a lot for your money. Overall, it is not so much in having a quick bite, but in getting a good deal.

I went with a group, and I broke one of my brunch cardinal sins: I ordered an omelette. After years of brunch I have realized that omelettes are just not very good. They are dense, underflavored, and just inferior to so many other egg plates and brunch plates. I ordered the Ranchero omelette and I was very underwhelmed, of course part of this is due to the problems with omelettes, and also the restaurant could have made it tastier. My brunchmates had tastier meals that I was able to sample, especially the Steak Benedict, so if I get back I will definitely order that. The beignets were tasty, and who doesn't love free beignets? Another plus is that River Valley is relatively cheap. But with an underwhelming omelette coupled with slow and inattentive service I had to give River Valley a 3.

However, over the past few months, there have been serious issues that I can't overlook anymore. INCONSISTENT FOOD QUALITY: Some nights it's delicious, and you question whether you just misremembered the bad times. But then, the sushi is really fishy other days, to the point where you kind of lose your appetite for that roll and just abandon it. The super white tuna is one example where it's either delicious or really fishy/ too watery/ kind of disgusting. And the yellowtail with scallion roll is so packed with scallion that I started wondering whether it's to hide the taste of fishy yellowtail. After trying the yellowtail nigiri, hypothesis confirmed. The bad quality isn't on some random weeknight, either. I've gone on Friday night and it's still fishy. Oh yeah, and this past time, the salmon roll we got was actually warm. Like it was sitting out for a really long time at room temperature. Seems like a recipe for food poisoning.FRUIT FLY ISSUE: \u00a0I've noticed a fruit fly here or there in the past, but this past time, I kid you not: as we sat down in a booth, 2 fruit flies flew out of the booth at the same time. It was like a disgusting fruit fly cloud. I went on to literally kill one table side with my bare hand because it kept trying to climb inside the soy sauce container. So disgusting. It makes me nauseous to think how bad the fruit flies must be in the kitchen if there are several scavenging in the dining area. Ew. SLOPPY SUSHI: \u00a0I'm not usually a sushi snob, but these rolls look like the fish was cut with a butter knife and rolled blindfolded. The rolls are nearly falling apart, rice is everywhere.LONG WAIT TIME: Recently, I ordered only 2 rolls for 2 people, waited an hour for it, then we decided to go to another restaurant to finish the meal because waiting was so horrible. Not a problem if you're in a big group with wine or beer, but not my favorite when hungry or on a schedule.

I've tried the red and panang curries, both with tofu.The Good:The red curry was just average. Very mild with your standard red curry flavor. There was a smattering of red and green bell peppers and a surfeit of bamboo pieces (straws? strips? they were thin like linguine and short--kind of annoying). The tofu was cut into thick blocks, which were way too ungainly to eat whole, or even halved. I'm not too particular about the shape/size of the tofu, but it is an important component to consider when it makes up 50-70% of your curry contents.The Bad:As for the panang curry, I'm sad to report that it was completely inedible. The flavor was absolutely repulsive. I tried to keep an open mind and give it a few tries--maybe this is what panang should taste like? maybe I've been deceived by ALL the other panang curries I've tried over the years at VARIOUS establishments--but no, it was just as foul-tasting the second, third, and fourth tastes. Too bad, Rosded, this is a dealbreaker. To top it off, I was unimpressed with the ratio of tofu to vegetable (which was all tofu and no vegetable, practically). It looked like an entire block of tofu was swimming in curry.The Ugly:My ultimate beef is with the rice portions. They give you one small scoop of rice. Small as in \"we're rationing rice because it is wartime and the government asked its citizens to make drastic cuts\"-small. It was nowhere near enough to accompany an entire bowl of curry. Pretty stingy, Rosded. I used two of your \"portions\" for one dish.Conclusion: I will not be patronizing this restaurant in the future. It boils down to the curry being such a let-down, the rice portions abysmally small, and the fact that they aren't on the Seamless app and don't seem to have an updated menu online anywhere.

No, not that one. Its the time of month that my husband and I visit Chicagoland for an exhausting combination of (mainly) work and some fun. The fun part is typically limited to trying out a new place for dinner. Either I love food way too much, or my fun-o-meter is easily filled. You decide.Excited about the cultural melting pot the windy city is, we once again opted for an Asian dinner. So i quickly detached my phone from my figurative hip, and pulled up my trusty Yelp app. \"Best authentic Thai\" in \"Chicago, IL\". Long list of restaurants? Check. \u00a0Always on the lookout for a small, hole-in-the-wall kinda place I figured I'd narrow it down to one dollar. After reading a couple of reviews (and running out of time on the express way) I navigated hubby to this highly regarded Thai restaurant in what appears to be a predominantly German neighborhood, go figure! \u00a0Imported Bavarian \"May-tree\" across the street, and all.Once inside I could only agree with previous reviewers, this place is indeed small, yet appeared to be surface clean *yay*. An official looking plaque hangs on the wall stating the maximum occupancy is 27, exceeding this number is 'hazardous and unlawful'. That should give you an idea as to the size of the dining room! We started our meal off with a fresh cold spring roll with peanutsauce and an order of tom yum soup. Both were pretty good, the soup had a nice level of.sourness to it whereas the springroll was slightly on the bland side. The peanutsauce which is served atop is sweet and chunky. Very peanut-y, unfortunately I could not pick up on any other flavors such as lemongrass or a hint of spice or even creaminess. I am a fan of the more complex kind of peanutsauces. Sorry. I have never been to Thailand, so I cannot speak for the authenticity of any of the dishes on the menu, or the items served. What I do know, is that my husbands Rosded special stir fry (I forgot the name, shame on me) had NO spice when ordered Hot, and the sauce itself tasted more American-Chinese than any Thai I have ever had. It faintly reminds me of your standard lo-mein flavor profile. Another thing I know is that the green beans that came in this dish were raw, and the onions were very strong. Cooked at higher heat and for a little longer, the natural and delicious sweetness of this bulbous veggie wouldve come out and wouldve actually complimented the slightly sweet sauce, quite well.Lastly, I have a terrible petpeeve with corny shaped vegetables. You know, the run-of-the-mill and cheap-looking star/gear shaped carrots for example. Yeah, they were definitely represented! Also, their mushrooms are shaped like a certain male organ, which I hardly doubt is their fault- but entertaining nonetheless. Now, hubby enjoyed the overall flavor of the dish, so I am happy that he was happy!After studying Yelp (and the menu), I decided to go with the panang beef, ordered hot. My first plate came out like pieces of beef under a.layer.of.oil. Not appealing. When I asked the waiter if this dish is always served like this, I was told it was due to the peanutbutter? I will post a picture, and you can judge yourself about the plausibility of that claim. The sweet man immediately offered to reduce it, and the second plate came out MUCH better, see pic. One bite and I was pleasantly surprised. The ghost of oilygreasypiecesofmeatgrossness made room for flavors that quite honestly danced on my tongue. Coconut, peanut, curry, basil and ireallydontcarewhatelse was a very satisfying combination that had me picking at my food long after I had reached the point of fullness.

The worst. The egg foo young wasn't bad. I thought it was a tad bland but Shanghai is not skimpy on the mushrooms and there were even bits in the gravy - which I appreciated. The egg rolls were good but they were not the big fatty egg rolls I read about. They were good though - crispy and good ratio of cabbage to protein. These are really important details to me when it comes to egg rolls. DISLCAIMER: As stated in another review the Mongolian beef is made with bell peppers. I'm not a huge bell pepper fan so I requested \"no green peppers\" on my order. I also added pea pods. Well, those sneaky sneaks at Shanghai still added red bell pepper to the dish. Granted, there was not a green pepper in sight, but ya know... Dish was still good. It was not a huge deal but kinda funny. Delivery was prompt and pleasant enough.

It's actually got strips of or orange peel in it, which add a little bit of bitterness, so if that's not your thing, be warned. I, however, think that's delicious. So yeah.Mongolian Beef, Beef and Broccoli, General Tso... everything I've had here has been awesome. I've yet to be disappointed.The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is their combination fried rice. It's good, but it's got tiny little shrimp in there. I like the big ol' ones. But that's just a personal preference of mine, and I can't really fault them for that. So.The point I'm getting at is: if you're not there right now, there is something wrong with you. Yes, it's that good.Also, delivery is also really fast. So don't order it on your way home, because they will beat you home. This has happened to me more than once. While they're really cool about it, I think it's really embarassing.

Simple flavors of cabbage and peanut butter. Orange dipping sauce was decent.Hot and Sour Soup - more like sweet and sour soup. The usual stumbling block for most hot & sour soups is the sour part. This one was a bit sour, sure, though it was undercut significantly by the inexplicable sweetness. That, and it wasn't hot at all. Not that spiciness would've saved it. Not recommended.Mongolian Beef - let me preface this by saying I would never have ordered this if not for all the rave reviews. My problem with Mongolian Beef in general is the reliance on a mountain of scallions. Most places give you about half beef and half scallions. That's too much! I ordered Mongolian Beef, not Mongolian green onions, dammit! That said, this wasn't the case at Shanghai Inn. No, instead of scallions, it was a mountain of bell peppers. Why didnt you warn me, Yelpers? I thought we were friends. Not a big fan of bell peppers, just fyi. But hey, the beef was tender and very flavorful. Guess what flavor? Yeah, lotta bell peppers, oddly enough. But if you dig that, this is perfect for youSesame Chicken - this one was pretty good. Light but significant breading, chicken decent enough quality, and not over-sauced, which can be a downfall of Chinese food. Veggies were crisp, almost too crisp, but all the better to stand up to the inevitable reheating of leftovers.Verdict - hit or miss. Most importantly, and lemme use capslock to really show I mean business, MONGOLIAN BEEF HAS TONS OF BELL PEPPERS. This has been a public service announcement paid for by folks who don't really dig bell peppers.

They have an ATM inside, but it's a generic ATM, the type that will probably charge you $4.00 to withdraw money. This is a big negative for this place. It's 2015, and a lot of people are getting out of the habit of carrying cash.

One criticism is theres no pricing on the special board so they need to add that n say how much! Another thing is they need to cut it for u! It only takes a second to do i found it annoying an way to messy to be honest i like american style pizzas not neapolitan pizza i get how italians crave balance n to let over due things but i think in this case its an excuse to only put like one piece of cheese they really skimp out like im all for balance but how could every pizza have more doe then condiments like put more cheese n meat plz!!!!!! Then u cant add extra toppings really i rather eat an american pizza that has a pound of meat n cheese on it. Also i dont like the burnt parts: so because of thay not gonna eat this style of pizza anymore but it is really good jus i dont like this type of pizza i didnt know what to rate it so like a 3???Fried macaroni balls: this was actually the best fried macaroni balls i ever had the texture outside was really good would have liked it more crunchy though the seasoning was good more pop would have been a nice touch though the inside was perfect the macaroni was not over cooked or undercooked perfect!! Then the pancetta was really good added a nice salty flavor to it there was alot of it! I think it would have been better with more cheese in the inside and it needed a dipping sauce like it was great but that would have made it like outstanding \u00a0would order again Minestra (soup) i love soup but it was really bland. U can tell they just put sausage n rapini in water thats it. The sausage needed to be browned cooking sausage in water is a crime it makes me supper bland. Then rapini u have to do something to it or its gonna be really bitter. The broth had no depth of flavor it needed alot of seasoning. Ik that italians dont like their bread grilled but it needs to be grilled!Arancini: perfectly crunchy the texture of the rice is perfect not gummy or hard. Then its stuffed with cheese omg so good!!!! Best rice ball i ever had the sauce was just a simple marinara sauce it was kinda sour so they need to fix that but id order againPulpo (grilled octopus) omg omg so tender no knife grilled perfectly so not bitter! Really was deliocus needed a lil salt though. The salad was perfect to cut down the richness of the octopus. The arugula wasnt bitter n the tomatoe added a nice sweet acidity. Use the lemon it makes the octopus taste better!Prosciutto and arugula pizza: the arugula was fresh not supper bitter wit that white paper taste to it. The prosciutto was high quality not the cheap kind from the grocery store idk if its the really expensive one though id have to taste it by itself. The cheese on the pizza was really delicious added a much needed creamyness and rich ness the texture of the pizza was really good not to crunchy not to chewy not to thick not to thin pefect balance and thank god not to burned only criticism was it needed more cheese like alot of cheese like there would be slices with nothing on it!! Then there needs to be more meat because the bitterness of the arugula needs it! Like the salty to bitter ratio was off way too bitter so it needed more meat dont be stingy!Tartufo pizza omg omg omg so good!!! Its so rich! I never had guanciale its so good picture a really rich not smokey bacon.omg soooo good!! Added the saltyness every pizza needs. Only problem put more guanciale plz!!! Dont be stingy!. Omg the cheese i love their cheeze so delicous so rich and creamy but plz put more! Then truffle omg if u never tried it buy it so rich makes anything taste better u gotta put more though comeon man plz put more. Pizza doe to topping ratio is offDiavola: everyone agreed that this was the best. Its so good. The salami is to die for adds that really salty and spicy flavor omg so good!

We then ordered 3 pizzas to share: A white pizza special with prosciutto: yes, we ordered another thing with prosciutto. It was worth it. This was a delicious pizza and would order it again. Diavola: cheese, tomatoes, spicy salami...yum! It also has some chili powder giving it a little extra spice. Margherita: a classic that nobody else in the city does as well as this. The crust is so good you could eat it on its own, really, but they add just enough toppings to make sure it doesn't get soggy in the middle. Also ordered the tartufo and panna cotta to split for dessert. I didn't have the tartufo because I don't like chocolate, but my dining companions were big fans. The panna cotta was excellent.

However it would be really easy to be twice as expensive as that if you had wine and wanted to try any of the specialty pizzas. \u00a0 It's not a cheap meal, but you can tell they use good quality ingredients. \u00a0 In the end it was a fun dinner, Spacca Napoli treated us well, and other people seemed quite pleased with their meals. \u00a0I thought the food was all fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.", "rating": "3"}, "50": {"date": [2015, 10, 13], "description": "This is hands down the best pizza in IL, maybe more! \u00a0I've been to Italy many of times in my life and this pizza is better than a lot of the places I had been over there! \u00a0The employees are very professional and friendly - always remembering who I am and what 'the regular' is that I order. \u00a0I am sad to say I moved out of state and can no longer enjoy this place like I once did - but you can! \u00a0Bon appetit!", "rating": "5"}, "51": {"date": [2015, 10, 5], "description": "I have been here now about 10 times.

They have seating on the sidewalk in the summer so it's a nice place to eat outside when the weather cooperates. My wife & I ordered the Burrata appetizer to start since it got such rave reviews. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is about the Burrata. It's tasty and if you've never had burrata before (or similar cheese) it's quite a treat -- but I don't know it warranted the price tag. ($16). I've had better burrata before so I'd skip it and save your appetite for the pizza.For pizza we ordered the Gianfranco. It was not your typical pizza. Instead of a red sauce it was a potato/leek puree, with mozzarella, shrimp, lemon, and mint. Non-red sauce pizza with seafood is risky, but we gambled and it SO paid off. A lot of places can make a pizza with red sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, but to make a delicious pie with with such non-traditional pizza ingredients definitely showed a glimpse of Spacca's inventiveness. For the Burrata and one pie the total was $36, which is reasonable. Even with just one pizza we had leftovers (the Burrata is that filling). Next time I go to Spacca Napoli w/ another person I would definitely get 2 pizzas, since they are so yummy. You'll probably have leftovers, but isn't that the point of going out to eat sometimes!

Then u cant add extra toppings really i rather eat an american pizza that has a pound of meat n cheese on it. Also i dont like the burnt parts: so because of thay not gonna eat this style of pizza anymore but it is really good jus i dont like this type of pizza i didnt know what to rate it so like a 3???Fried macaroni balls: this was actually the best fried macaroni balls i ever had the texture outside was really good would have liked it more crunchy though the seasoning was good more pop would have been a nice touch though the inside was perfect the macaroni was not over cooked or undercooked perfect!! Then the pancetta was really good added a nice salty flavor to it there was alot of it! I think it would have been better with more cheese in the inside and it needed a dipping sauce like it was great but that would have made it like outstanding \u00a0would order again Minestra (soup) i love soup but it was really bland. U can tell they just put sausage n rapini in water thats it. The sausage needed to be browned cooking sausage in water is a crime it makes me supper bland. Then rapini u have to do something to it or its gonna be really bitter. The broth had no depth of flavor it needed alot of seasoning. Ik that italians dont like their bread grilled but it needs to be grilled!Arancini: perfectly crunchy the texture of the rice is perfect not gummy or hard. Then its stuffed with cheese omg so good!!!! Best rice ball i ever had the sauce was just a simple marinara sauce it was kinda sour so they need to fix that but id order againPulpo (grilled octopus) omg omg so tender no knife grilled perfectly so not bitter! Really was deliocus needed a lil salt though. The salad was perfect to cut down the richness of the octopus. The arugula wasnt bitter n the tomatoe added a nice sweet acidity. Use the lemon it makes the octopus taste better!Prosciutto and arugula pizza: the arugula was fresh not supper bitter wit that white paper taste to it. The prosciutto was high quality not the cheap kind from the grocery store idk if its the really expensive one though id have to taste it by itself. The cheese on the pizza was really delicious added a much needed creamyness and rich ness the texture of the pizza was really good not to crunchy not to chewy not to thick not to thin pefect balance and thank god not to burned only criticism was it needed more cheese like alot of cheese like there would be slices with nothing on it!! Then there needs to be more meat because the bitterness of the arugula needs it! Like the salty to bitter ratio was off way too bitter so it needed more meat dont be stingy!Tartufo pizza omg omg omg so good!!! Its so rich! I never had guanciale its so good picture a really rich not smokey bacon.omg soooo good!! Added the saltyness every pizza needs. Only problem put more guanciale plz!!! Dont be stingy!. Omg the cheese i love their cheeze so delicous so rich and creamy but plz put more! Then truffle omg if u never tried it buy it so rich makes anything taste better u gotta put more though comeon man plz put more.

Not just that, but they now have an extra charge for beef dishes--it's no longer part of the \"chicken, pork, tofu, veggie\" category.

The \"Butterfish\" was in a deep fried batter that tasted like Elmer's Glue. What fish there was beneath the sticky batter/coating had been so deeply fried that it was more fat than fish. It was under an equally gluey, sweet, peanut-y cocoanut milk sauce that tasted like Jiff, and could easily have been served with grape jelly. This sauce turned up in the curry, too, which we had ordered because the way-too-long-and-complex menu said it had \"a slightly sour flavor.\" We'd hoped it would offset the coconut milk fish concoction. Alas. It was the same gunk, only with something sour-perhaps vinegar- added. We tried TWO noodle dishes. Since we're not meat eaters, we get our noodles veggie style, with tofu.

Probably the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Normally I don't gripe about mediocre service, but this deserves its own review.

We all looked at each other like, \"Did you order that?\" \"No, did you?\" \"No.\" We asked about the sampler and the girl looked incredibly confused and walked away. Fifteen minutes later that came out. The apps weren't great. Spring rolls were basically tasteless, the sampler was all fried, greasy, and not much filling or flavor. Two of us got our mains about five minutes after the sampler came out and we waited a while for our third to get his. After about ten minutes it was pretty clear it wasn't coming out any time soon and he told us to just eat. I'm glad we did because he didn't get his food until we were done with ours. One of us requested a substitution and didn't get it. I had the Panang curry and it was fine, but way spicier than Panang curry should be.

I came here because I was interested in purchasing a Kobo e-reader and found online that BC is one of the only places in Chicago that sells them. For those of you who are not familiar with Kobo, they support tons of different platforms to download books, so unlike the Kindle, you are not locked in to only buying books from Amazon. And you can actually buy ebooks from local, independent booksellers and support your favorite local shops! Kobos are huge all over the world, but a lot of people here in the U.S. don't really know too much about them. But, I digress. I walked in and it is just the type of cozy, homey atmosphere that you makes you want to cuddle up with a book and stay in here all day.

Not finding it by manually searching, I approached the front desk to see if they could find it in their computer system or hiding in the back. At first they said they were \"out of stock.\" However, the two gentlemen exchanged a furtive glance and one said, \"Let me go check in the back.\" After a brief time, he returned with a copy of the book I was looking for, stuck a bookmark inside the cover, and said to me, \"This is on us, if you don't mind the small corner being bent on the back cover. We were going to throw it out since it is 'damaged.'\" I looked down at the back of the book, and there on the bottom left corner was a minuscule crease that I wouldn't have noticed in a million years.

The cafe is unique in that there is a space to drink coffee and sit down on one side and then there is a small, cozy, indi style bookstore on the other side.

Both times I was looking to purchase the books as gifts and mass market doesn't hold up to my standards when gifting books. I'm probably pickier than most because I work in the book industry, but I don't see why a high-quality local bookstore would ever be compelled to carry classic and bestselling books like the ones I sought in the format usually reserved for places like Costco and Walmart. However, I am certain they would order the better-made formats for me if I ask (I've ordered something specific from them in the past) and their selection of exceptional books from smaller, indie presses makes up for the couple mass market disappointments. For instance, they carry everything, or almost everything, offered by McSweeney's and will do small displays for Chicago publishers like Featherproof books. Neither are easy to locate elsewhere.

I usually just ask to join them at their table (there are 13 tables inside, 8 with two chairs each and the rest have benches) and it's rarely a problem. Brick walls decorated with art for sale, huge windows, alternative-but-not-depressing soundtrack (looking at you, Starbucks, with your 5 Elliott Smith songs in a row).

When I obtained a new job and returned to The Grind after not having been a while, Liam even offered me a congratulatory drink on the house.Although space is relatively tight and can sometimes be limited, it contributes more to the communal vibe than anything else and has never been a real issue for me.

Salad bar & produce temperatures are good now, lol... I used to avoid this place even though it was right across the parking lot from my apartment, but it's much nicer these days.---I wish I could give it more stars, but if I didn't live immediately around the corner, I'd never go here.This place seems to cheap out on refrigeration. Salad bar is disturbing -- temperature is visible, kept between 58-68 degrees (so, practically room temperature). I check it all the time, gross. I would get salad bar a couple times a week... but since it is limp & questionable I won't touch it. Same story with the deli counter, everything seems luke warm, not cold. The gelato is decent enough, but I end up with a drippy mess 2 seconds after going out the door so I re-freeze at home & then it's cold enough to eat.Fish section stinks all the way to the dessert counter. Vomit city. It's worse than the San Francisco fish markets I used to frequent... amazing.I feel bad for the employees. They've never been super rude, but they don't look happy to be there. Manager seemed very annoyed when the cashier asked for a price for the pickle I got, $0.99 in a new pickle barrel thing, which tells me they're not giving the employees info they need to help customers, so no, they're not going to be good at customer service. Bad management means bad training means bad employees & bad customer experience.Bags. What the.... I bought a loaf of bread & a soda... they gave me 2 plastic bags. Really, I'm not a gigantic hippy about it, but I really don't need that!! Every time I go in there they give me 500 plastic bags for a small basket of groceries... if I bring my own bag (I frequently do) I get eye rolls & gratuitous offers for additional plastic bags. Ok...Also, the salad bar guard makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong when I look at the aisles near him (creepy... unwelcoming... alarming...), there never seem to be baskets available at the door so I have to search under the registers before I shop, the produce is ok but the organic is bizarrely overpriced... Finally, while the store can't do anything about this, the people who shop there are super rude... on numerous occasions I've had people full on bump right into me *while giving me eye contact as they do it* - what in the... I've been bruised by wayward shopping carts, children running around screaming, people who just don't seem to notice I exist... it's weird. And it happens just about every time I'm in there.

Those other Tony's are basic stores in mostly working-class neighborhoods. This one is a small step up. Chicago (and surrounding suburbs) has had to deal with the abandonment by the Dominick's chain, leaving a huge number of store properties empty, waiting for new tenants. Albertson's, the parent company of Dominick's, was lucky to have sold some of it's stores to the Mariano's chain and this almost-new one was wisely bought by Tony's Finer Foods. Having shopped here when it was a recent new Dominick's in 2013, I was able to compare qualities of that experience now that it's \"transformed\" into a Tony's. Arrival at the store and parking here is unchanged - best if you are heading northwest, but then you can run into a jumble of cars negotiating the limited and constricted ground-level parking spots. I happened to be \u00a0heading southeast, so the best option was to turn left at the light at Berwyn (before it was a Dominick's, one-way west, now two-way, up to the building entrance). This got me to the driveway and ramp up to the roof-top parking. Still plenty of open spots up there and a convenient elevator ride down to the store proper. Shopping carts of two sizes were plentiful up on the roof and down at the elevator exit/entrance. Nothing about the experience of getting here had changed. This was good.Inside, the layout has also remained pretty much unaltered from the Dominick's floor plan, although actual usage may have been customized for certain Tony's offerings. Having shopped at another Tony's just two days previous to this visit, I know that the prices are consistent between those two stores. The traffic pattern is still mostly circular from deli to produce to packaged goods to check-out, as the old Dominick's was. Overall, the impression is that the actual floor space seemed just a smudge less open than when it was as a Dominick's. But today it was pretty crowded (more than when it was as the previous brand), so that could be a factor (and maybe a good sign too).

Why you ask...because I step next door and have some fabulous food while my clothes are washing. \u00a0It has become part of my routine.When this place opened I couldn't wait to try it out. \u00a0We are always looking for new places to eat. \u00a0I must say all the waiting was worth it. \u00a0From the Spinich Philo to the roasted potatoes there hasn't been one thing on this menu that I have tried that wasn't pleasing to my mouth and stomach. \u00a0Whatever you order make sure you taste the homemade Lepina Bread. \u00a0It is made fresh daily by the owners mother.This place is friendly and welcoming. \u00a0And VERY affordable. \u00a0I recommend it to anyone looking to have a great meal at great prices.", "rating": "5"}, "7": {"date": [2012, 7, 22], "description": "Good food much better than any fast food places very reasonable prices", "rating": "5"}, "8": {"date": [2011, 2, 21], "description": "Give these guys a try. Delicious and authentic Bosnian food, along with pasta, salads, and hamburgers...something for everyone. The owners are a nice husband and wife, and you'll see their sons help out often. Nice people. They remember me and greet me with a smile and wave when I come in and seem to really appreciate business they receive. Try their Ustipke (fried bread) with kaymak spread. You won't regret this...Freshest bread EVER! My boyfriend and I go nuts over this stuff! \u00a0Great price, great portions, and it feels good to support the local businesses instead of the chains!", "rating": "5"}, "9": {"date": [2011, 6, 13], "description": "Yes - this place is easy to miss since from the outside it could just as easily be a run of the mill hot-dog stand.BUT! The food is truly awesome. \u00a0The traditional Bosnia (I think the owner said he was Bosnian) breads and meats are so delicious. \u00a0The Cevapcici sandwich is my favorite. \u00a0They serve it on a soft pita-like bread that they make there. \u00a0When we went, they were slow and the guy behind the counter (I assume the owner) took us into the tiny kitchen where his mother (all the bread recipie's are hers, he says) was rolling out Philo dough on a big stainless steel table. \u00a0The table was easily 4 feet by 4 feet and she has a thin layer of unbroken dough stretched across the whole thing - so thin you could see through it like wax paper.We're looking forward to going back and trying the spinach pies and other treats.They have hamburgers and Italian beef there as well, but the reason to go is the traditional food.", "rating": "5"}}, "latitude": 41.9788717478514, "longitude": -87.6925914734602, "neighborhoods": ["Lincoln Square"], "number_of_reviews": "15", "price": "$", "rating": "4.0", "times": {"Fri": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Mon": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sat": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Sun": [], "Thu": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Tue": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"], "Wed": ["10:00 am", "8:00 pm"]}}}
